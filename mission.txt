God
God is a bullet
And religion is a loaded gun
Prod poke push and pull it
Every zealot loco is some mother's son
It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down again
Burns their blood soaked bibles
And she tears the halos from their saints
Turn to love for survival
Escape her traps and restraints
It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down again
Reach out and touch me
And give me absolution
Reach out and touch me with your love
Reach out and touch me
And give me absolution
Reach out and touch me with your love
Sends her sons to war
Behind a bloody flag and a filthy lie
Defends her greed for more
And watches as she lets her children die
It's coming down
It's coming down
It's coming down again
Reach out and touch me
And give me absolution
Reach out and touch me with your love
Reach out and touch me
And give me absolution
Reach out and touch me with your love...




 She's got her hands on my steering wheel
Driving my car and I'm just the passenger
Taking me to heaven again
And I'm getting there too fast for her
And when she takes a dangerous curve a swerve
It makes me rush
And when she puts her foot on the brake it slows me down
And makes me blush
Sometimes when she drives too fast I lose control and then we crash
Close my eyes when she overtakes I don't wanna see a head on smash
And when she shifts it into fifth I'm along with
Her for the ride
And when she hits the open road I explode
And we collide what a ride
And when we reach our destination our location
I'm all out of breath
She'll be the death of me




 Lay down your arms and surrender to mine
Let me release you from your tangled skein
Burn down your temples and your holy shrines
Sift through the ashes for the truth that shines
No more weeping or wringing of hands
Come with me to the promised land
Close your eyes and we'll go down slow
We're gonna drown in the afterglow
In the aftermath of Babylon
All the pimps and whores have gone
All the guilt has been laid to rest
Just remember mother never knew best
Tear down the walls raze them to the ground
Your ivory tower we'll burn it down
And in the evening when the sun gets low
We're gonna drown in the afterglow




 Will the angels greet me when I leave this mortal coil?
Will the gates of heaven open when they lay me in the soil?
I ain't been such a bad man I've tried to do the best I can
A man can't serve two masters
It's either the good Lord or the bad
Whichever way you roll
Make sure it's the best life you coulda had
Finding the light in all the darkest places
When I go don't be sad
There ain't no prayer in the Bible can save me now
Can save me now
I built myself a levee to hold back the flood
And when the levee broke I got fire in my blood
I ain't asking for redemption
I'm too far gone to save
Just hoping for some peace
When they lay me in my grave
There ain't no prayer in the Bible can save me now
Can save us now




 When the evening falls comes the sadness of the moon
And the deepest darkest ocean of your eyes
And the sorrow and regret in the whisper of your voice
Betrays a lie that healing comes with touch
And you say hush, baby hush, you say something you'll regret
Never promise anyone forever
Close your eyes and dream and try to forget
The paradise comes, but never forever
And I'm all tangled up in you
The blinding delight that is yours to bestow
You hide it away deep inside your heart
Like blows to a bruise and yes, I got scarred
The haunting past is holding us apart
And I'm all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up, tangled up in you
I know you're scared of giving yourself and being bounded by love
But love doesn't have to be shackles and chains
You don't have to promise me anything, but I'll take anything you give
'Cause there's so much more than I've ever known
So much more than I've ever hoped
And if
As the thought of you plays gently and sublime
You weaved into my dreams and all I feel
And the colours you parade are designs for your charade
But I glimpse beneath your veil and you rebuild
A trembling, fragile heart and a yearning to be adored
If only you believe I feel the same way as you
To take shelter in my arms and sleep the sleep of angels
If only you believe I'm all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up in you
And I'm all tangled up, all tangled up, tangled up in you




 It's never just a war of words
There's always some kind of hidden agenda
All you ever want from me
Is a white flag & a quiet surrender
This could be for ever more
As long as I succumb & suffer in silence
Love is like a battlefield
Where words are soldiers & talk is violence
I'm just doing the best I can
But I'm not your alpha man
I'm doing the best I can
But I'm not your alpha man
All you ever want me to be
Is another dead butterfly to add to your collection
Trapped in the killing jar
Tethered & bound to your idea of perfection

 It's no shot in the dark
And no trick of the lights
You tease me, adore me
Talking dirty, sitting pretty
Lay me down and anoint my wounds
Dust up, bust up, let's get down to the nitty-gritty
You call on favours promised and sworn
Changing names and changing places
The blade digs deep
And the cut begins to sting
There's more to this than reason
Or the old familiar rhythm and rhyme
Take me shake me lead me
To the floor and hey let's swing
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on and on and on
We're going up in flames
We're burning up in a blaze of glory
Don't put fire into the hands
Of the weak and faint, the weak and frail
Tripping the light fantastic
Let's celebrate our great escape
For goodness sake, it's all the same
The sinner and saint, heaven and hell
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on and on and on
We're going up in flames
We're burning up in a blaze of glory
Don't put fire into the hands
Of the weak and faint, the weak and frail
Tripping the light fantastic
Let's celebrate our great escape
For goodness sake, it's all the same
The sinner and saint, heaven and hell
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on
And the dance goes on
And the dance goes on and on and on and on




 She comes and she goes
She ebbs and she flows
She is as water as elusive as the breeze
Everything I am is she
I swear in the presence of God that she is an angel
From heaven above just to rescue me
She is the air I breathe
And she is the sun that warms my skin
She is Aphrodite she is Venus she is love
And she is virtue and she is sin
Like the first sip of wine that burns my throat
Once I've had a taste I'll always want more
She is a promise the thrill of a first kiss never wanting more than this
She is Aquarius
Manchild insatiable and indulged
I'm a mess of contradiction I'm told.......
She sanctifies me never denies me always pacifies me
She is Aquarius
She
She sanctifies me never denies me always satisfies me
She is Aquarius and I am Gemini




 Ah ha, make me tonight
Tonight, make it right
Ah ha, make me tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Oh
Ah ha, make it magnificent
Tonight
Whoa
Ah, your hair is beautiful
Ah, tonight
Atomic
Tonight, make it magnificent
Tonight, make me tonight
Your hair is beautiful
Whoa, tonight
Atomic, oh ah
Atomic, oh ah
Oh ah, atomic
Oh ah, atomic
Oh ah




 It's never enough to apologise
You always want more than I give
It's never enough to admit I'm wrong
You always want more rope to hang me with
It's never enough to work my fingers to the bone
A new man's work is never done
And it's never enough to grovel and crawl
Use my apologies as bullets for your gun
Bang bang, and I'm dead
Hold your gun right to my head
Bang bang, and I'm dead
No matter what we say we know it's got to end this way
(No matter what we do we know it's either me or you)
(I want you to know it hurts to see you go)
Bang bang
It's never enough to shoulder the blame
You want to crush me with the weight of disappointment
It's never enough to admit defeat
Rub salt into my wounds as your anointment




 I'm lying in the dark listening to the rain
Reminds of you and makes me me sad all over again
Your measured swoons and sighs
Your hand me down whispered alibis
And it's easy to forgive but it's so hard, so hard to forget
And it's easy to see how deceit, deceit becomes regret
I can see now we're apart
How your mind played tricks on my heart
I never knew that you were untrue
There's so many shades of green
And I never believed that you would ever deceive
There's so many shades of green, so many shades of green
So sleep with your snakes and enjoy their viper's kiss
I want you know there's nothing about that I miss
I don't wish you any pain
But I don't ever want to see you again
So just shut your mouth
I've heard it all before
Shut it, just shut it
I don't wanna hear any more
I never knew that you were untrue
There's so many shades of green
And I never believed that you would ever deceive
There's so many shades of green
And you never knew that I was also untrue
There's so many shades of green
And you never believed that I could ever deceive
There's so many shades
So many shades of green




 All I ever need is the truth but I all ever want is affection
Masquerade as Jesus Christ and suffer the crucifixion
Lips that speak of love eternal come heal my savaged skin
Cast aside all thought of revenge searching for Nirvana within
And God only knows my belief holds strong
The wisdom comes when the heart suffers long
And I'm shedding tears for Judas a kiss may betray
And I'm on the side of angels on the heels of a dream a ghost to lay
A hard reign may fall and a cruel wind may blow
The moon may be pale and I may never know
The need for silence but I can see hope in the wind in the rain
Lay belief on me my angel child
The actor and the poet martyr castles carved in sand
Delight and the promise of Eden lay in the touch of your hand
As sweet as sin sweeter still the taste
The way of all flesh lay me to waste
And heaven knows that the meek shall inherit the earth
Lay belief on me my angel child
Behold a silent ocean in a precious grain of sand
And if I have to explain then you'll never understand
My petals are strewn scattered by the breeze
It's whispered in the wind echoes through the trees
Love's a disease and it rips me apart
Come heal my ravaged heart
Lay belief on me my angel child




 Cold still waters running deep
Pale before the eyes
Ravaged
By the hands that feed
Thunder clouds the skies
Drifting with the tide
Floating with the stream
The howling winds have gathered strength
From a whisper to a scream
Sell me down the river
And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
Heed to Neptune's calling deceived in fable and lore
Learn from treacherous bibles
Of murder, hate and war
Searching for the tears
In an ocean of rain
The yearning of the raging sea beckons once again
Sell me down the river
And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
Gathering of the storm
And the winds are blowing wild
Sweeping over cross and creed, country, colour and child
Mother Nature cries for love
Her children lost at sea
And as the waves take me away
Say a prayer for liberty
Sell me down the river
And out to sea
Cast me adrift and set me to sail
Just on last kiss before raising hell
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale
Beyond the pale




 There's a lump in my throat and an ache in my heart
There's tears in my eyes, 'cos we're an ocean apart
There's nothing quite as real as being on my own
Nothing quite as true as being all alone
This bird has flown
But when the summer has passed she'll come back home
Love, come wing your way
Sweet bird of passage, come home to stay
Love, come wing your way
Sweet bird of passage, come home to lay with me
May you stay with me forever
With the change of seasons, she flies her nest
And like the sun at dusk, she sets to the west
Loneliness is the cross I bear
Solitude is the cloak I wear
I miss you, I need you, I love you
When the autumn comes I'll be waiting for you
Love, come wing your way
Sweet bird of passage, come home to stay
Love, come wing your way
Sweet bird of passage, come home to lay with me
May you stay with me forever
Forever, forever, forever




 It's always the same, I'm always to blame
Your accusations leave me numb
And how I regret how you always forget
The violence and damaged done
I could never explain, the seduction of pain
It's like a bad drug I can't hick
And how can I resist when you seduce with your fists ?
Boys will be boys when the blood runs quick
You always bring me down, you always bring me down
It's a mystery to me how cruel you can be
You always bring me down, you always bring me down
But I come crawling back to you and then you beat me
Black and blue, black and blue




 When You get to my age the candles cost more than the cake
It´s not the white powder anymore that´s keeping me awake
I'd make a pact with the devil if I could be 21 again
I´ve been riding the blinds on this runaway train
I can feel my Juju working I've got my black cat bone
I asked you once for water but you gave me gasoline
You dropped oil in my lap and the you lit the kerosene
I conjured my mojo but it don´t shield me from your spell
I got the black snake moan and I've been there and back to hell
I can feel my Juju working I've got my black cat bone
Going down to the crossroads there´s a deal I have to make
It's just before midnight and my ashes haul to ache
I've got the graveyard dirt on the sole of my shoe
I ain´t your monkey man but I guess I'll have to do
I can feel my Juju working I've got my black cat bone
Atibon Legba, open the gate for me




 Listen
To the silence
Of the breaking of my heart
From a lowly vale
To the rolling hills
You and I
Lie worlds apart
Time is catching my breath
As love bleeds slowly to death
Black mountain mist
Take me back again
Black mountain mist
Come carry me home
And sleep
Is stirring dreams
Of innocence and yesterday
When the sun shone bright
And high in the sky
And we lived in hope
Of come what may
Forever with laughter we cried
And the truth is never could we have lied
Black mountain mist
Take me back again
Black mountain mist
Come carry me home
And when the rain comes
To clear away the mist
Feel it's caress
Feel it's embrace
Feel it's wasting kiss
Black mountain mist
Take me back again
Black mountain mist
Come carry me home
Black mountain mist
Come carry me carry me home
Carry me carry me home




 I gave you flowers and you gave me faith
We of minds and hearts that move as one
Chameleon, warrior, gypsy and brave
We turn our eyes to the heart of the rising sun
You and me, we are blood brothers
You and me, we are blood brothers
Blood brother, lay down your life for me
Lay down your love for me
Kiss by kiss, touch by touch
We tore the clouds apart
You took my hand and walked me through the rain
An act of love, a mission of tender mercy
We stood tall and proud together we conquered again
You and me, we are blood brothers
You and me, we are blood brothers
Blood brother, lay down your life for me
Lay down your love for me
We pulled no punch and we gave them hell
Made the fearless cry and the shameful tell
Mountains and sand and seas and land
We moved winds to calm
And we rose again to win the war to
Rule and reign our hearts to soar
Heads held high, we touched the sky and we kissed
The ever faithful moon




 She's got her hands on my steering wheel
Driving my car and I'm just the passenger
Taking me to heaven again
And I'm getting there too fast for her
And when she takes a dangerous curve a swerve
It makes me rush
And when she puts her foot on the brake it slows me down
And makes me blush
Sometimes when she drives too fast I lose control and then we crash
Close my eyes when she overtakes I don't wanna see a head on smash
And when she shifts it into fifth I'm along with
Her for the ride
And when she hits the open road I explode
And we collide what a ride
And when we reach our destination our location
I'm all out of breath
She'll be the death of me




 I've got pornography and a mirror covered in dust
I've found religion and a habit I can trust
You take me to the place where angels fear to tread
I feel the blood rushing to my head
There´s no one else that knows me the way you do
There´s no one else that can take the place of you
So when I´m feeling lonely I always turn to you
You're always there for me no matter what I do
And no one ever knows the pleasure that we share
When loneliness is just too much to bear
And when no one has called when I´ve waited by the phone
I take my comfort here in you and I alone
And when there is no other to hold me like you do
I just surrender and give myself to you
Born under a good sign, baby, but you're bad
Been 'round the world, baby, and you´re the best I've had
Born under a good sign, baby, and when the stars align
You always take me, baby, o'er the finish line




 I'm living in the hope
Of a breath to be shared
It's all I've ever wanted
It's all I ever dared
So breathe
Breathe deep
Breathe
Breathe long and hard
Breathe with me
Breathe with me




 (Screaming people)
Snow blind, dog tired
Snow blind, and barb wired
Last chance in the jungle trance
And the fast step of the monkey dance craze
War paint, misty days and dizzy faint
Keeping the faith, spinning turning
Watch the flames
Of bridges burning!
Turning colors and shedding skin
Shining brightly, thick and thin
Mirror of God, legend and myth
The fatal charm of the treasure
Gift wrapped and heaven sent
So trapped on islands of intent
Avenging angel of the wild and yearning
Stoke the flames
Of bridges burning!
It burning me over!
Bridges burning!
Burning, drives me wild
Yearning for the small child
Blind men cry, but shed no tears
See no evil, speak in tongues
And hear you say, "Lovers Leap"
Cos there's NO other way across waters deep!
Feel the fire and the fool is learning
To run from the flames
Of bridges burning!




 I met her in a bar in Barcelona
She introduced herself, said her name was Mona
She asked me if I'd like a littel company
Maybe some blow a little ectascy
Of course I'm not the kind that would ever refuse
I had time to kill and nothing to lose
This is nothing new this is nothing grotesque
Come on
All we're gonna do is
Is dance the burlesque
So we walked through the streets back to my hotel
Where I gave her head and I did it so well
Then we lay on the bed and smoked a cigarette
Shooting the breeze about what I forgot
And then she's held her breath and said
I'm dying for you
I'm coming baby won't you die a little for me too?
This is nothing new this is nothing grotesque
Come on come on now
All we're gonna do is
Is dance the burlesque
The older I get the more I wanna live
The less I have the more I wanna give
And the further I fall the higher I wanna climb
And the harder it is the more I wanna make it mine
Come on now
I love to watch you move
Love to watch you undress
Come on, come on now
I love to watch you dance
Love to see you burlesque
Come on, come on now
This is nothing new this is nothing grotesque
Come on come on now
And dance the burlesque with me




 Silver and gold and it's growing cold
Autumn leaves lay as thick as thieves
Shivers down your spine chill you to the bone
'cos the mandolin wind is the melody that turns your heart to stone
The heat of your breath carving shadows in the mist
Every angel has the wish that she's never been kissed
A broken dream haunting in your sleep
And hiding in your smile
A secret you must keep, love cuts you deep
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
There's no scarlet in you, lay your veil down for me
As sure as god made wine, you can't wrap your arms around a memory
Take warmth from me, cold autumn wind cut sharp as a knife
And in the dark for me, you're the candle flame that flickers to life
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love breaks the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Wise man say all is fair in love and war
And there's no right or wrong in the design of love
And i could only watch as the wind crushed your wings
Broken and torn, crushed like a flower under the snow
And like the flower in spring
Love will rise again to heal your wings
Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel
Love heals the wings of a butterfly on a wheel




 The hounds are a-howlin' and the moon is so full
How bright are the stars whilst the dark can be so cruel
Hunting for prey across this ocean of a night
Capture and devour, come and sate your appetite
Cast your spell, I'll be a victim for you
Can't your smell, another victim for you?
Throw me on the fire and I'll melt in the heat
The smell of burning flesh has never quite been so sweet
Tear the meant from the bone and leave nothing to waste
Have yourself a feast cos you're now got the taste
Cast your spell, I'll be a victim for you
Can't your smell, another victim for you?
Can't you tell, I'll be a victim for you?
So eat well, another victim for you
I wanna be seduced and ravaged
Your voodoo's working on me
I wanna be debauched and savaged
Come and work your voodoo on me




 Let's dance around in circles
Let's dance around the maypole
Let's welcome the season
Let's celebrate Mama Nature's bountiful soul
Let's feast at her banquet
Give thanks and let the good times roll
Come on and join hands
Come on with me and my May Queen
Come and bang your drum
Come and shake your ass and tambourine
Rejoice and let's get merry
Come on and let's dig this scene
Let's all come together on this celebration day




 It's just like you oh Chelsea Blue
To ask me to fly and then you tether my wings
I always knew oh Chelsea Blue
How cold is the blood that flows through your veins
You patronize and you condescend
You delude yourself and you pretend
Too often wiser but also more despised
I swear by all the saints I will avenge you
I'm not ungracious but I'm also not obliged
And I won't apologise if I offend you
One man's trash is another's treasure
And one man's poison is another's pleasure
There's always two sides to a story
Do you abhor me or adore me?
I've been dying to tell you Chelsea Chelsea Blue
That privilege is a flight of your conceited imagination
Does it surprise you that I despise you?
And I thank God for my emancipation
You raise your sword to my olive branch
And your empire falls like an avalanche
How can you live in such denial?
Small minded prejudice is so vile




 Dust is the one
She provides all the fun
And we're all falling down in a heap on the floor
We're falling around
Pleading for more
And shell shocked eyes keep shooting their lies
As she lays down the law and the god given line
She lays down the law
We cut it fine
This is child's play
This is child's play
Snow in Berlin and she freezes my skin
Pick up a thought
And she gets out of hand
Perish a thought
And she makes demands
With her tongue and her frown
She dresses me down
She bleeds me dry and tears me to shreds
Bleeds me dry
And leaves me for dead
This is child's play
This is child's play
Child's play
Child's play
Child's play
She never says die and she never asks why
One thing she's learned is she's kind to be cruel
One thing she's learned
It's better to serve than to rule
This is child's play
This is child's play
This is child's play
This is child's play
Children at play
Child's play
Children at play
Child's play




 Reason always deserts me
When faced with the promise her body makes
And do you think it really hurts me
To watch the pleasure that she takes
From you?
And when she lets you lets you touch her
Can you touch her in a way I never can
I never can?
'Cause I'm such an Indian giver
Can't prise my eyes away
And to watch her makes me shiver
With delight at her display
It's a Chinese burn
I like to see her perspire
Watch the sweat running down her back
She is a slave to my desire
Remember this as she goes down on you
'Cause I'm such an Indian giver
Can't prise my eyes away
And to watch her makes me shiver
With delight at her display
It's a Chinese burn
She loves it in the middle
But a lesson you must learn
Is you'll never come between us
And she'll always return
To me
It's a Chinese burn




 I feel your warmth around me
In the touch of your hand
I feel you warm surround me
The swell of a wave that breaks upon the sand
I'm drifting
I'm floating
I'm rising
Within you
I have never knew surrender quite like this
In such chained embrace can have and only exist
And even though i may be a butterfly soon
I am still just a chrysalist in you
You are my cocoon
You are my cocoon
It's raining, it's cold outside
But i feel so warm inside of you
Nothing can touch me in here
I could live forever inside of you
I'm drifting
I'm floating
I'm cuming
Within you
I have never knew surrender quite like this
In such an embrace can have and only exist
And even though i could be a butterfly soon
I am still just a chrysalist in you
You are my cocoon
You are my cocoon
You are my cocoon
You are my cocoon




 Sweet Jesus come & save me
I've been weak & gone astray
Take me down to the water &
Wash my sins away
Sweet Jesus I believe
I have no faith in the word you say
Make me clean, make me pure again
Make me ready for the judgment day
I'm coming home, coming home
I'm coming home, home to you
Lay my hands on the Bible & swear to
The good Lord above
I'll make amends for my sinful ways
& give myself up to your love
No more whiskey or whoring
Or fighting like an alley cat
Cos' in the eyes of the Lord it don't
Matter where you're from
It just matters where you're at
I ain't always been an honest man &
I've never been as white as snow
Travel a dark & dirty road
Then you reap just what you sow
Sweet Jesus be my saviour
Come & lay your hands on me
Count me in for the resurrection
Heaven for eternity




 Well I can't take it, take it anymore
Everyone I know is a pimp or a whore
As ugly as sin and as sleazy as hell
Everyone I know has got trash to sell
From the mouth's of babes come the words of the wise
Please don't ask me to apologise
Load up your gun to play Russian roulette
I'll take another drag on your funny cigarette
And I'll cry like a baby
Rally the troops, the battle lines are drawn
The darkest hour comes before dawn
Don't you talk to me of self respect
Cos all I hear is cause and effect
I've got no bridges left to burn
Got no place left to turn
I'm a shooting star ready to crash
Don't want your credit I'll just take your cash
And I'll cry like a baby
Crawl back under your stone hide your face in shame
Look to yourself cos I'm too easy to blame
The smell of burning martyr, stench of decay
I'll trample over you if you get in my way
And I'll cry like a baby




 Come close my baby girl
I've got something I need to say
I'll miss you my darling child
I'm so sorry I gotta go away
So say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
So say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Remember I've no regrets
Remember I'll never forget
You gave me joy and blind delight
You gave me faith and shone so bright
You gave me reason and I'm proud of you
Be good, be strong, be honest and true
So say goodbye cos daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven
Now
I'm so tired now, so frail and so weak
I've been fighting so long I need release
I've never been scared, scared to die
Don't mourn for me, don't even cry
'Cause when sleep comes to end this pain
I know in my heart I will see you again
So say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye 'cause daddy's going to heaven now
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye




 So you find it hard to face the cold harsh light of day
Hiding in the shadows of resentment and blame
The argument for violence over reason holds no sway
No matter what you promise I don't think you'll ever change
Damaged, you're oh so damaged
So you can't exist without your powder and pornography
It's a dangerous place where the white line makes you go
Armed with wide-eyed logic and a hand-me-down biography
There's a devil inside when the mirror's covered in snow
Damaged, oh so damaged
Don't you think you're taking just a little too much for granted
Crawling from the wreckage of another crashed car
And don't you think you're taking just a little too much advantage
Climbing up to heaven just to piss on the stars
Damaged, oh so damaged




 Run you ragged
Torn and jagged
Sharp tongued, ripped and ragged
Couldn't find the party line
Gee whiz, it's happy time
Mirror, mirror, reflects me hazy
The heat's on, I'm running round crazy
Here's the road, didn't miss a trick
While you trash the punch and kick
I'll kiss the lips that sealed your fate
I'll bring you flowers and place them on your grave
Dreaming of colours, swamped in dust
Sweet dreams all covered in rust
Looking at heaven, gladdest ghosts seen
Turn to kill this crazy dream
You are revered for your work with ink and mirrors
You are renowned for bringing me steel and power
So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass
Shadow boxing, mild and meek
Send me flowers, tongue in cheek
Medicine man cast a spell
Head spins round, kiss and tell
So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass
Cheeks on fire, dance on glass
A touch of magic, a hint of class
Dress in leather, play in the dark
Pain and torture leave their mark
Take no prisoners, smash the light
Lunatic fringe, kiss and bite
Wild promise, cheeks are red
Battle cry, and then it's off to bed
You've taken my heart and ripped it from my sleeve
Hold it in your hands
Grip your fingers and it starts to bleed
So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass
You shudder at a touch




 She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with me
Here I go and I don't know why I float so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me
I'm dancing barefoot heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on
He, chosen but she
Here I go and I don't know why I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me
I'm dancing barefoot heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She is recreation
She, intoxicated by thee
She as the soul sensation and
He is levitating with she
Here I go and I don't know why I spin so ceaselessly
Until I lose my sense of gravity
I'm dancing barefoot heading for a spin
Some strange music drags me in
Makes me come on like some heroine




 Believe in magic believe in lore legend and myth
And the hand that guides in the cunning of hope in the weaving of dreams
And the lady of the lake takes my hand and leads me
To the holy isle and the fairy rings and the circles of stone
Forever and again
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Surrender to the wisdom of age and the spirits of time
Remember our souls entwined for eternity
And the healing hand of the fairy queen will come to all who have faith in her
And the apple tree will bear it's fruit in the gardens of Avalon
Forever and again
Give me, give me, give me deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Let me sleep for awhile and dream of Avalon and the Beltane fires
And a silent kiss steals away into the mist and out to the lake
Where the sword will rise again from the water into the
Hands of the chosen one the righteous one
Forever and again
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me
Give me, give me, give me, deliverance
Brother, sister, give me, give me
Deliverance, deliver me




 I'm the father of a bastard child and I'm not talking about my daughter
I feel that my head's on the chopping block, like a lamb being led
Being led to slaughter
I close my eyes but sleep won't come and now I've got the devil to pay
I'm so sick and tired of this masquerade
How many loaves?? do you think I can bleed?
Do you feel? Do you feel it at all?
'Cause together we stand but divided we fall
I lower my guns to play Russian roulette
But I'm too damn scared to pull the trigger
'Cause a bullet in the head would leave me dead
And it's better to live as a rock and roll nigga
Do you feel? Do you feel it at all?
'Cause together we stand but divided we fall
The monkey fights a mother(?) like a man fights himself
And it's always a fight without a winner
Those endless lines on the way to hell
'Cause heaven never welcomes a sinner
Do you feel? Do you feel it at all?
'Cause together we stand but divided we fall
Do you feel? Do you feel it at all?
'Cause together we stand but divided we fall




 It´s a golden dawn with a crystal sky
The cock is crowing and so am I
Walk barefoot through the morning dew
Yesterdays gone and so are you
There´s somebody knocking on my door
Wants me to wear the hat I once wore
But everything's changed I'm not the same
I'm not the one to blame, Oh no
So If I leave it all up to you
Nostalgia is all we´d have to look forward to
But I ain´t the kind to reminisce
Ain´t nothing about you that I miss
Don´t drag drag drag drag drag drag drag
Don´t drag me down




 When you're scared and fell all alone
Reach out for me
In the cold and dark of night
Reach out for me
I will always be there for you
No matter what you say or you do
I will always shine hard for you
And light your way
When the world is dragging you down
Reach out for me
And when the hurting goes too deep to tear
Reach out for me
No matter how far away
Whether it's night or day
Remember I'm under the same big sky as you
The warmth from the sun will liberate an beautify
So spread your wings and soar into the sky
As the dragonfly
When you're feeling shackled and chained
Reach out for me
When you're tethered by doubt and fear
Reach out for me
There's nothing I wouldn't do
I'd lay down my life for you
I want to believe in the spell in the spell your weave
And love will always heal and purify
So open up your wings and soar as the dragonfly
With every dawn there comes a sunrise
After every storm there comes a blue sky
With every kiss there comes a promise
The warmth from the sun will liberate an beautify
So spread your wings and soar as the dragonfly
And love will always heal and purify
So open up your wings and soar into the sky
As the dragonfly
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
As the dragonfly




 Two five zero five zero five
Tonight it feels so good to be alive
Oh boy have you heard the news?
Together we've blown away the blues
And through the empty fallow years
We kept singing and kept the faith
And through it all the hurt and tears
We kept singing, kept singing, we kept the faith
We'll never walk alone, we'll never say die
Together we will stand, we're an army
Ascending to the throne, hold our heads up high
The world in our hands, we're an army
Draped in red
Again we've written our name into history
Against all odds and in the face of adversity
And from our darkest hour we emerge victorious
'Cause we kept singing and kept the faith
Buried and dead we rise again proud and glorious
'Cause we kept singing, kept singing we kept the faith
We'll never walk alone, we'll never say die
Together we will stand, we're an army
Ascending to the throne, hold our heads up high
The world in our hands, we're an army
How could I leave after a night, after a night
A night like this?
I've never known such sheer delight, I've never known such blinding bliss
We'll never walk alone, we'll never say die
Together we will stand, we're an army
Ascending to the throne, hold our heads up high
The world in our hands, we're an army
Draped in red




 Ravaged, by the lines of age
Too many appetites to sate
Blue and as dark as death
Been swimming too long
Can't catch my breath
I'm going down again
Don't wanna drown again like this
Don't wanna fall apart like this
Can't let the world see me like this
Hollow, empty as a promise
Don't get no pleasure from this
Sorrow, as cold as snow
Been holding on too long, can't let it go
Tears me asunder again
I'm going under again
Got no one but myself to blame
It's dragging me down into the Blue
I'm slipping under without you
So please don't leave me here again




 I won't ask you for an explanation
'Cause there is nothing you can say that I'll believe
So boy your mouth is only good for one thing baby
So get down on your knees in front of me
'Cause you're so dumb I bet you'll never know that this song is about you
You're so dumb I bet you'll never guess that this song is about you
Please don't tell me that it's my imagination
That in life we always get more than one shot
Don't confuse ambition with wishful thinking
'Cause we all want something more
Something more than we already got
Let's put another quid in the slot
I've got nothing to say I haven't said before
So I'll say it again and I'll say it some more
You don't like the things I say
So I keep on saying 'em anyway
It's not how fast you can move
It's not how much you have to prove




 My mommy don't want me, daddy don't want me too
Nobody wants me, left me in the dying room
I ain't seen sunshine, never felt the rain
Never tasted joy, but I know pain
So please don't leave me, in this god forsaken hole
Please believe me, don't wanna die here alone
You stand accused, wish I'd never been born
Feel so abused, no one to mourn, the dying room
My mommy don't love me, daddy don't love me too
Nobody loves me, dying in the dying room
You turn away, and you shield your eyes
Feel so betrayed, feel so despised, in the dying room




 She knows the mystery
Of masks and of veils
She bestows ecstasy
In the torture that she sells
She'll bind you, blind you, make you plead
For love and mercy on your hands and knees
She'll make you scream and beg for more
She'll put the pain inside you that you adore
Evangeline, Evangeline
Kiss the spike of a Louis fifteen
Evangeline, Evangeline
Bow down and worship the whiplash queen, Evangeline
She's versed and practised well
In the art of discipline
She's cursed as a Jezebel
God damn Eve and the original sin
It's such a thin line between heaven and hell
But she walks it fine and she's knows it well
She'll make you feel more than you've ever known
She'll make you show more than you've ever shown
Evangeline, Evangeline
Kiss the spike of a Louis fifteen
Evangeline, Evangeline
Bow down and worship the whiplash queen, Evangeline
Bow down before me on your hands and knees
Take the pain you deserve and I will release
You will surrender and you will obey
And you will serve in every way
Bow down before me, you will believe I will bestow and you will
Receive
Bow down before me on your hands and knees
Take the pain you deserve and I will release
Evangeline, Evangeline
Kiss the spike of a Louis fifteen
Evangeline, Evangeline
Bow down and worship the whiplash queen
Evangeline, Evangeline
Kiss the spike of a Louis fifteen
Evangeline, Evangeline
Bow down and worship the whiplash queen, Evangeline




 Some crazy holy roller trying to sell you Jesus
Trying to sell you helter skelter
He sells you genocide, he sells you kingdom come
Now watch the little piggies run for shelter
Cease to exist, just come and say you love me
Welcome to the family, meet Sadie and Gypsy
They'll creepy crawly under your skin
And every time a bell tolls, and you've blood on your hands
An angel, an angel gets her wings
Cease to exist, just come and say you love me
And you had Jesus until I came along
So come and join this freak show of mine
There's a place for you with us, a place for you in Heaven
All that glitters is not gold, in Heaven
Even you may shine
He preaches revelation, chapter and verse
And all dead swine grow up a sacred cow
Too many Christ's and never enough crosses
Who shall we crucify now?
Cease to exist, just come and say you love me
Shine on




 I can taste your lipstick
I can feel your breath
I can feel the shivers running down my spine
I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your hand
I can feel your fingers dancing down my spine
I give myself to you heart and soul
Flesh and blood forevermore
I can taste your sex
I can feel your heat
I can see the fire burning in your eyes
I can taste your sweetness
I can feel your joy
I can see the flames dancing in your eyes
I give myself to you heart and soul
Flesh and blood forevermore




 There´s a look in your eye like the flash of a razor blade
It's tropical in here It's 96 in the shade
Caught in the act and banged to rights
Fingerprints all over the scene
And in your hand my gun´s still smoking
I'll take a hit on what you're toking
Know what I mean
If you'll be my bitch then I will be your dog
And I'll feast on your flesh like a greedy hog
Let's rub and grind our hides together
If you're mine tonight I'll be yours forever
Jacking the ball and balling the jack
You take the reins I'll take the slack
I've lain with the devil and cursed at the heavens above
You showed me magic tricks and I called it love
There's a price to pay to feast with panthers
Don´t ask me I ain´t got no answers
I´m fixing to pounce ready to attack
Let´s go to bed let´s hit the sack
Like angels on horseback like pigs in a blanket
Load up the tablets it´s a gannets banquet
Let´s gorge ourselves like it´s our last meal
And like a black widow I eat what I kill
Everything but the squeal




 A sheer moon
Bless her silken heart
Waiting for the stars
To come out and shine
Head in the clouds
And she kisses the sky
Trick or treat on the tip of her tongue
And shooting the line
Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss
Let me kiss the moon
The hard shine
And heaven be praised
She's pure in thought and
Hand on heart and heaven sent
Reaching for the stars
With a trembling hand
Childish eyes
Betray the love of the innocent
Fabienne, let me kiss
Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Let me kiss the moon
Let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss the moon
Fabienne, let me kiss
Let me kiss the moon




 Can't stand the light it hurts my eyes
And it comes as no surprise
To find
A broken heart has no reprieve
In all the things we leave
Behind
I can remember can recall
When once we had it all
Before
Can't stand up for falling down
When you're not around
No more
I won't forsake you
Don't wanna break you
Don't wanna make you
Make you cry
And time may heal
The pain we feel
But there's nothing real
In this goodbye
It's easy to be kind to strangers
Whilst we hurt the ones we love
And all I've ever wanted is to be a father to the child




 I can taste your lipstick
I can feel your breath
I can feel the shivers running down my spine
I can feel your heartbeat
I can feel your hand
I can feel your fingers dancing down my spine
I give myself to you, heart and soul, flesh and blood
For ever more
I can taste your sex
I can feel your heat
I can see the fire burning in your eyes
I can taste your sweetness
I can feel your joy
I can see the flames dancing in your eyes
I give myself to you, heart and soul, flesh and blood
For ever more
For ever more
For ever more
For ever more
For ever more
For ever more, heart and soul
For ever more, flesh and blood
For ever more, I give myself to you
For ever more, heart and soul, flesh and blood, forever
For ever more, heart and soul, flesh and blood, forever
For ever more, I give it, I give it all to you




 From one Jesus to another napalm can be a treat
Religion is only cold comfort 'cause Judas Iscariot was a cheat
Bullet holes in my mirror and a minefield across my floor
I don't want to be a soldier, don't want to fight someone else's war
I don't need no Hare Krishna
I don't need no primal scream
I don't need no mantra chant
I don't need no self esteem
I'll take to bed John the Walrus 'cause my Baudelaire has been pawned
Plagued by demons, deceived by angels
What little devils have we spawned?
And Buddha sits on my shelf shooting up Edgar Allan Poe
And I'll dream in 'Forbidden Colours' just like Vincent van Gogh
I don't need no suit of armour
I don't need no sword and shield
I don't need no immortality
I don't need no Elysian fields
I don't need no lollipops or rainbows
I don't need no hare of the hound
I don't want to be mummy or daddy
I don't need no duty bound
It's bedlam just like Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse causes a scandal
Kahil Gibran was a junkyard and Genghis Khan was a vandal
And I fell in love with Marilyn Monroe and
Then Kennedy told me she'd died
And anyway, if it came to a choice, I'd take Mata Hari for my bride
I don't need no religion or faith
I don't need no collusion
I don't need no spiritual healing
I don't need no self-delusion
And Jesus walks on water
But does he ever walk on air?
I'm getting lost again, mummy
Scared again, daddy
And the beauty of it all is I no longer care




 I remember the first time I laid eyes on you
Early morning
And the forest hotel and all the things we've been through
New day dawning
You were such a timid child so shamefully shy
And full of dormant pain
Dulled by wind and rain
You kissed me like a wounded sigh
I'll love you 'til the day I die
And as the butterfly is born from the cocoon
And as a raindrop becomes a monsoon
And as the woman was once just a girl
Waiting to unfurl
From the oister comes the pearl
I remember how you used to hide behind me
Muted light
How good to see you now all the things you can be
Burning bright
You were such a damaged child too many broken dreams
A sun eclipsed by the moon
A black and white cartoon
From a whisper to a scream
Like a diamond in the gleam
And as the rapture becomes finally a swoon
And as an ocean breeze becomes a typhoon
And as the woman was once just a girl
Waiting to unfurl
From the oister comes the pearl




 I see your dancing, laughing, naked
Sweet and pretty face
And the promise, burning brightly
In your crystal-shot eyes
Your savage, and violent flesh
The cut that bleeds, the kiss that stings
We're shooting up stars and desperate snows
That fall from shimmering skies, So
(chorus)
Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight
Revelation is laid, and reflects
On the windswept liquid mirror
Of this breathless world, this Happy Death
This elegance in charm
The treasured first fleeting touch of a gracious stranger
In-charmed me and entranced me
I know you can do me no harm, so
(chorus)
We're playing with fire, dancing in the flames
And we're covered in burns that may never heal
And angels may come, and angels may go
But it's heaven on earth when you
(chorus)

 Minnie Mouse grins her Cheshire cat grin
The cat who's got the cream dribbling down her chin
Valentine sleeps in a heap on the floor
Give the dog a bone and she'll come back for more
The man in the moon is swinging in the breeze
Hanging like a fruit from the never-green tree
The face in the window is familiar and sad
My head is pounding and it's driving me mad
And I don't know how I feel anymore
Cos there's nothing left to hold on to
And I don't know what is real anymore
I wish I could get back, wish I could get back to you
Faith hope and charity hanging in the hall
The genius of Dylon Rae tacked to the wall
There's a chill in the hair and it feels like snow
Better wrap up warm if you're planning to go
And I don't know how I feel anymore
Cos there's nothing left to hang on to
And I don't know what is real anymore
I wish I could get back, wish I could get back to you
Monkey see monkey do
I wanna be like you
Monkey see monkey do




 The only meat that will touch these lips of mine is human
Hope you consider that animals feel pain the same as we
Barbaric slaughter so you can put meat on the table
To feed yourself
I hope you choke yourself to death on the very first bite
We are accountable we are the choices that we make
And there's no reason for cruelty towards those that can't defend themselves
Well it's obscene that someone gets fat from the pain and suffering of
The innocent and defenseless
It's grotesque a twisted burlesque
A gruesome Halloween all the cruelty that I've seen
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
Always remember that gluttony precedes a fall
Kangaroo killers Adidas battery farms just to feed us
Animals under the blade just another hide for the skin trade
It's grotesque a twisted burlesque
A gruesome Halloween all the cruelty that I've seen
Grotesque and we're all to blame
Grotesque we should hang our heads in shame




 Every time I think of you it's like the last beat of my heart
The memory of leaving you is tearing me apart
No waves, no tears, no backward glance
But I'll always hold you dear
Never regret but I'll never forget
'Cause there's not enough heaven here
Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean
Ocean
And every time I'm missing you I just can't let it show
And every time I want to cry, I just can't let it go
Wine and song and masquerade and refuge holds me dear
Ribbons and lace and daisy chains
But there's not enough heaven here
Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water, reaching out for you
Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean
Bangles, beads and lipstick games
And comfort holds me dear
Velvet and lace and perfumed sheets
But there's not enough heaven
Not enough heaven here
Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water, reaching out for you
Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean
Ocean
Ocean
Ocean
Hands across the ocean, reaching out for you
Across the waves, across the water
Hands, across the ocean




 Every day I spend with you
Is another perfect day
Every moment is God given
And when you smile at me and say
"Please honey don't you go away"
It breaks my heart but feels like heaven
I'm so enchanted by you
So wrapped up in everything you do and
I'm so happy
I'm so happy
I'm so happy when I'm with you
Girl I know you understand
The child that lies within a man
Baby you always see right through me
And when you put your hand in mine
And tell me I'm your valentine
Angel you know it means the world to me
I'm so enchanted by you
So tangled up in everything you do
And I'm so entranced by your kiss
I swear I'll never want more than this
Because I'm so happy
I'm so happy
I'm so happy when I'm with you
I'm so happy
I'm so happy
I'm so happy because I love you
Because I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you because you say you love me too




 Your psychobabble is so alien to me
And I don't understand your pyschotherapy
I don't want your conversation
I don't need no explanation
When you spout your blah blah blah and your cod philosophy
My signed Bukowski you sold behind my back
And undermining is your chosen mode of attack
I don't want your measured excuse
I don't need cerebral abuse
You know I know the truth and the truth is you're a quack
And the things you preach are all in breach
Red flags are raised sets me ablaze
And the things you say give it all away
And the things you do all betray that you
You're a headshrinker




 Let me lay waste with gentle persuasion
Let me lay down
To sweat in the heat
On the back of beyond we laugh at all reason
And in the light of it all
There's no need to retreat
And the heat comes down
And the heat comes down
And hand in hand
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
Save for the asking fortune favours the brave
Let me take strength
From the child in your eyes
And between the lines we dance into the mirror
And a grateful embrace
Layes in wait for the sun to rise
And the heat comes down
And the heat comes down
And hand in hand
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
Please don't take it hard when
I give myself to you
And love will come easy
When you deign to swallow my pride
Before I ever touch your lips
You promise the very earth to me
And tender hearts and broken down
When you take me deep inside
And the heat comes down
And the heat comes down
And hand in hand
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
We melt in the heat
Melt in the heat




 Good lord above I'm falling in love
I'm falling like a heavy black rain
And I know how it feels to be head over heels
I'm falling like an avalanche again
As beautiful as you are
As elusive as the stars
As raging and as wild as the sea
As eternal as the moon
As mysterious as the womb
You mean everything to me
And heaven knows I'm so wrapped up in you
So tangled up in everything you do
And heaven knows it always seem to be
More like a curse than than a blessing a blessing for me
Well I have to profess I'm so obsessed
And it's taking over everything I do
And forever more like waves upon the shore
I'm drowning at the very thought of you
As black as the blues
As tender as a bruise
You give me everything I ask you for
As delicious as the pain that comes slowly and again
I take everything you give and still want more
And heaven knows I'm so wrapped up in you
So tangled up in everything you do
And heaven knows it always seem to be
More like a curse than than a blessing a blessing for me
As delicate as the wings
Of the butterfly summer brings
As sweet as the honey of the bee
As miserable as regret
A betrayal I can't forget
You are everything to me
And heaven knows I'm so wrapped up in you
So tangled up in everything you do
And heaven knows it always seem to be
More like a curse than than a blessing, a blessing for me




 Ever
There's oceans between us
Take to the sea, take to the sea
There's heaven before us
Float on the waves, float on the waves
Pale moon lay belief on me
Mother come give me birth
You give me heaven
And I'll promise you the earth
Heaven
Lays on your pillow
Sleep in your eyes, sleep in your eyes
Lays in the waiting
Steal every moment, hold every breath
Gentle heart beat as one
Dream for the beauty of birth
You give me heaven
And I'll promise you the earth
I'll die for you, if the time ever came
I'll kill for you and shoulder the blame
I'd cry for you and never feel shame
For the child is within
For the child is within you
Precious
I want the earth for you
Precious
I hold out my hands to touch the sky
And only the pure go to heaven
Suffer the child unto you
Forever more
Heaven on earth
Bless me my godess of love
For all your blessing is worth
You give me heaven and I promise you the earth
I pray for the second coming
Worship you for the first
You give me heaven and I give you the earth
You give me heaven and I give you the earth
You gave me heaven and I give you the earth




 I'll kiss the sleep from your eyes
I'll kiss you when the sun goes down
I'll kiss your until sunrise
I'll kiss the skin from your lips
And I'll kiss you on your fingertips
And I'll kiss you on the back of your neck
And I'll kiss you behind your ears
And I'll kiss away your tears and fears
And I'll kiss away those hurting years
And I'll kiss away those cruel dark hours
And I'll kiss the petals on your flower
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you
I'll kiss you until heaven sends you
I'll kiss you between your toes
I'll kiss you on the bottom of your feet
I'll run my tongue across your back
I'll kiss you behind your naked knees
I'll kiss your breast, I'll drink your milk
I'll run my tongue between your lips
I'll kiss you, kiss you, kiss you on your sex
And I'll take you, take you, take you in my mouth
And I'll kiss you, kiss you until heaven sends you




 Dressed as seduction she's curious and cruel
She steals her way into your trust
And first you want her kiss and then you want her more
And then she'll have you crawling in the dust
Don't speak to me of dignity don't speak to me of love
Don't talk to me of sanctity don't talk to me of love
She's hungry as the hunter and she's shooting for the thrill
She's hungry as the hunter and she shoots to kill
The swastika a grinning skull tattooed on your arm
The needle and the damage done
The heresy of romance with the lady in white
And the beautiful and damned die young
Don't count on me for sympathy don't come to me for love
Don't talk to me of liberty don't talk to me of love
She's hungry as the hunter and she's shooting for the thrill
She's hungry as the hunter she shoots to kill
You've gone to the devil god rest your soul
A shot in your arm is like a knife in my back
Addiction to the lady coursing through your veins
She holds the whip you love to crack
Don't talk to me of serenity don't talk to me of love
Don't speak to me of divinity don't speak to me of love
She's hungry as the hunter and she's prowling like the hound
She's hungry as the hunter she'll track you down
She's hungry as the hunter and she's shooting for the thrill
She's hungry as the hunter she shoots to kill




 I've felt the heat
In the city of Angels
Dust up on high
And the worse for wear
I've seen the lights
Going down on sunset
Madmen running loose
There's murder in the air
So this is America
Love colder than death
Working the streets
Love doesn't come cheap
So I learn how to steal
Religion for sale
Buy my way into heaven
Sell my soul for a trick
It's not worth a great deal
So this is America
I remember her smile and her virgin heart
I remember her tears tearing me apart
I remember my hands helpless and tied
As they led her away I remember I cried
I've put my life
In the hands of a scream
Small talked and less
With legends to be
But I carried a torch
For the child forbidden
And when the heat closed in
They crucified me
So this is America
Dreams don't come easy
Without any sleep
On this damned bed of nails
Laid wide eyed and weary
I hit the freeway
And step on the speed
Head for the desert
When madness prevails
So this is America
God bless you America
God bless you America
God bless you America
God bless you
America




 Such exquisite torment
To be so denied
With every furtive glance
I am sanctified
Such delicious torture
Forbidden and so chaste
With every new surrender
Comes a new and sweeter taste
We steal our silent pleasure in damned conspiracy
We share our whispered sighs in Bible Black complicity
We tempt the hand of Eros with yearning and denial
We craft the course of subterfuge with cunning and with guile
In denial
We're in denial
In denial
We're in denial
And this hell feels like heaven
And if Gods ever deign
That we should be together
Please no empty platitudes
Or promises of forever
Let's savour every moment
As we yield to destiny
'Cos all I want is you
And all you want is me
In denial
We're in denial
And this pain is God given
In denial
We're in denial
And this hell feels like heaven




 Just because you disagree it doesn't make me wrong
And just because you think I'm weak it doesn't make you strong
Push me too far or hurt what's mine
I will retaliate I won't hesitate
I've told you once now I'm telling you twice
I will retaliate make no mistake
Do you get what you deserve or deserve what you get?
'Cause only guilt can break a man break a man more than regret
Push me too far or hurt what's mine
I will retaliate I won't hesitate
I've told you once and now I've told you twice
I will retaliate make no mistake
You can't take back the things you say
Or the love you've given away
Success is getting what you want but happiness
Is wanting what you get I'm in silhouette
I won't forgive and I won't forget
I will retaliate I won't hesitate
And you will live with cold regret
I will retaliate I'm in silhouette




 Mumbo jumbo, listen to the whispers of madness
We have climbed mountains of dust
We have seen gold gather rust
Hocus pocus the stampede of my heart
We have sailed on the stars through the air
We have flown on the wings of a prayer
Into the blue, only with you
Into the blue, only with you, into the blue
Gasoline rainbows swimming in the puddles in the street
Whichever way the wind blows we've got the whole damn
World crawling at our feet
Laughing canyons and everglades
Candle flames and razor blades
Dancing through the poppy fields, hand in hand we cascade
Into the blue, only with you
Into the blue, only with you, into the blue
There's a singing dwarf on the streets of New York
There's a shuffling man with plastic on his head
There's a preacher woman crying in the traffic
Crying for the living crying for the dead
The waste of it all, the waste of it all
And there's more at stake than we could ever know
'Cos when we're together we always fall
Into the blue, only with you
Into the blue, only with you, into the blue




 A silver moon and a singing breeze
I'm walking out under the stars
I light a cigarette and watch the smoke
As it chases my dreams away
I turn my gaze out to the sea
And watch as the waves come tumbling in
Off in the distance, an angel cries
As the ship of the line comes into bay
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
Building castles and flying flags
And my lips begin to sting
I feel the sand beneath my feet
And my Halloween heart begins to sing
The flashing light warns of danger here
But the ship comes on sailing in
I run for shore and a way to hide
I need a time and a place to think
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I look around to find a friend for life
Seeking refuge in your arms
Splinters of ice, thin, sharp and cold
Pierce my freezing skin
By the skill of your embrace
You show me a grave new world
And against the tide and dashed on the rocks
The ship of the line comes on in
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me
I'm just an island in a stream
I'm all at sea, come rescue me




 I wish I knew then what I know now
I've been the ass that's pulled the plough
Was it just yesterday when you had so much to say
And now when you open your mouth you just bray
You're always looking for someone else to blame
You're always looking to fan the flame
You've always got some wild beast to tame
And I'm just another pawn in your game
I betcha David Bowie knows my name
And Morrisey, He'll deny it, but I'd guess the same
They'd say 'Hussey is a harlot just dress him up in scarlet
Whilst I am a star He's just a starlet'
You're always trying so hard to impress
You're always saying no when you're meaning yes
You're always looking for credit you can claim
And I'm just another pawn in your game
Never try to catch a falling knife
Bugsy hailed a cab to the afterlife
I ain't the kind to sup from any old dirty cup
When you're going down I'm coming up
You're always looking for some new fad to embrace
You've always got some wild goose to chase
You've always got a new picture for your frame
And I'm just another pawn in your game




 Dark secrets that lie behind closed doors
Everyone of us has something to hide
Family ties blood thicker than water family wars
When push comes to shove and rape comes as love whose side are you on?
Just shut your mouth and we'll keep it in the family
And do you lie awake in your bed at night
Just praying for the morning sun?
Too scared to breathe too scared to dream with a hand on your mouth so you can't scream
Just waiting for the sun to rise
In the cold light of day there's nothing to say
Just shut your mouth and we'll keep it in the family




 Desert rat cry me wolf
Shedding skin upon you lips
I pray
For the love of madness
For the hand that takes the grip
And we close our eyes
To forgive and forget
And we close our eyes
To forgive and forget
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come
I build myself a brave asylum
And ask all the madmen to play host
And when the colours all fade away
It's time for us to give the ghost
Give up the ghost
And we close our eyes
To dream a while
And we close our eyes
To dream a while
Dream a while
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come
And while we're talking in tongeus
Of animal behaviour
With a flick of the wrist you could've broken my heat
And done yourself a favour
And I cry in the heat
For the promised and given
The hand I once would trust
Now for the love of heaven
You won't see me
See me for dust
And we close our eyeas
To love again
And we close our eyes
To love again
Love again
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come
With bated breath for the kingdom come




 Desert rat cry me wolf

 A burnt out truck on a desert highway
Frank on the radio doing it My Way
And the sun beats down it's a hundred and ten
And the girl in the back vows "Never Again"
There's too many bends in the road too many curves
And the way I pout gets on your nerves
Those who hear not the music think the dancer mad
And all I've got to say to you "it's the best time I ever had"
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Reach out and touch and lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Reach out and touch and lay your hands on me
Wipe the sweat from my fevered brow
Holy Moses I'm a sacred cow
Love isn't fear love isn't possession
And love doesn't bind with the guilt of transgression
I'm breaking the skin of a papier-mache grin
I'm only curious I've never been that brave
And I know how it feels with the devil at my heels
To be the sinner that the good Lord never saved
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Reach out and touch and lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Reach out and touch and lay your hands on me
I've been diving for pearls, now I'm coming up for air
Just because I understand doesn't mean I care
Another bleeding heart messiah a cold savior machine
Selling me absolution as the American dream
You're always there to catch me catch me when I fall
First a kiss and then and then you want it all
Once I was an angel now my halo is on fire
I'm burning up I'm shedding skin and I'm walking a high tight wire
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Reach out and touch and lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Lay your hands on me
Reach out and touch and lay your hands on me




 There's the crime of passion
And the crime of revenge
But the worst crime of all
Is the crime of regret
Speak of the devil
And the devil may speak of you
Why can't we
Let sleepin' dogs die?
Deep, it cuts deep
And the affection, it grows
And heaven only knows
What you were to earth
And the giving birth
To the giving rounds of judgement
And by fact of reason
You accuse of treason
Claim betrayal to the Holy Ghost
Of the sacred past
It's fading fast and forever
You took my hands
And turned it over
Why can't we
Let sleepin' dogs die?
No devil so dark
As the devil I know
There's no love lost
And no reason why
Talk, of faith you talk
But you were the one
Intent on stun
You took my glory and pride
Sanctity defied
And you never knew what the Gods could bring
By playing the game
Of who's to blame
It gets harder all the time
To put my trust in you
So reverence please, let sleepin' dogs die
Let sleepin' dogs die
Let sleepin' dogs die
Let sleepin' dogs die




 I'm not scared anymore
I'm not scared of the dark when I sleep with you
And I'm feeling alive
And I'm feeling strong again when I'm with you
And it hits me
Just like a runaway train
And it blows me away
Just like a hurricane
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
You make me feel just like a child, a child again
I'm not trapped anymore
Between madonna and the whore when I lay with you
And the days run away
Like wild horses run away when I'm with you
And I'm breathing you in
Just like the morning air
And I'm wrapping you around
Just like a skin to wear
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
You make me feel just like a child, a child again
Oh sweet thing
I'm born once again
For you sweet thing
Just like a baby again
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
And I'm in heaven and it feels like a gentle rain
You make me happy and I want you to feel the same
You make me feel just like a child
A child again




 Once I thought I saw you in a crowded hazy bar
Dancing on the light from star to star
Far across the moon beam, I notice who you are
I saw your brown eyes turn and watch the fire
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
Somewhere safer where the feelings stay
I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away
Away, away, away
I'm just a dreamer and you are just a dream
And you could have me anyone to me
Before that loving you touched my lips
The perfect feeling when time just slips away between us
And the foggy trip
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
Somewhere safer where the feelings stay
I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away, away
You are just a dreamer and I am just a dream
And you could have me anyone to me
Before that loving you touched my lips
The perfect feeling when time just slips away between us
And the foggy trip
You are like a hurricane
There's calm in your eye
And I'm getting blown away
Somewhere safer where the feelings stay
I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away




 I've sang you songs of candlelight and razor blades
I've sang you songs of being loved and betrayed
I've sang you songs of redemption and righteous crusade
I've sang you songs that made you laugh and made you cry
I've sang the blues and I've sang you lullabies
I've sang you songs of flaming one night stands and long goodbyes
I've sang you songs that rejoice and celebrate
I've sang of love by design and by fate
I've sang you songs of ache and lust and appetites to sate
I've sang you songs of the holy and divine
I've sang you songs of devils and cheap wine
I've sang you songs of fawning courtesans and concubines
I've sang you songs of sadness and of pain
I've sang you songs of the needle and the vein
I've sang the songs of the tears washed away by the rain
I've sang the songs of loss of grief and despair
I've sang the songs of destruction and repair
I've sang you songs of hope belief and faith in prayer
I've sang you songs of birth and of death
I've sang you songs of air and of breath
I've given you songs born of cocaine and crystal meth
I've sang the songs of ageing ruin and decay
I've sang you songs of the hunter and his prey
I've sang the songs of disenchantment fear and dismay
I've sang you songs of blame and accusation
I've sang you songs of shame and recrimination
I've sang you songs of regret guilt penance and salvation
I've sang you songs the words of others and made you believe they're mine
I've sang the songs of heaven of Gods and stars that shine
I've sang you songs that have touched you sent shivers down your spine
I've sang the songs that made your heart sing
That made you feel like a bird on the wing
That made you soar and sometimes roar I made you sing
But I can't bring myself to sing
Of ever leaving you
Of ever leaving




 When you touch me you save my life
I don't need redemption I don't want christ
All I've ever needed, all I've ever wanted is you
So hey baby rae you can elevate me
You can raise me up, you can make me see
The wonder and the innocence in everything
Little thing you do
I wanna lose myself, lose myself in you
When I look into your baby blue eyes
I can see the ocean, I can see the skies
I can see the sun and the moon and the
History of the world
You are the beacon, the guiding light
You are the hand that leads me through the
Night, you are the heaven's most beautiful and
Brightest star
I wanna lose myself, lose myself in you
I never knew I could feel like this
I never knew I could feel this way again
I never knew it could be like this
I never knew I could feel this way again
So believe in me cos I believe in you
Yes, I believe in you
I wanna lose myself, lose myself in you




 Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved
Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved
Love is you, you and me
Love is knowing we can be
Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved




 I believe in angels
I believe in heaven
I believe in colours
I believe in sunshine
I believe in laughter
I believe in crying
I believe in magic
I believe in dreams
I believe in lovely
I believe in friends
I believe in love
I believe in peace
I believe in children
I believe in deliverance
I believe in me
But most of all I believe in you




 Let me come inside your ivory tower
Let me come inside your hallowed walls
God, it's heaven in here
Fix me with your hand of praise
Fix me with your touch of precious thrills
Your fingers dance across my skin
Reaching out for the pride of man
Hand in hand, flesh in flesh
We're walking through the fire of love
Breath by breath, and flame by flame
We burn till the sun rises and shines hot
Love comes gushing, love runs free
My love comes all over you
My love comes for you
Love me to death, my flower
Run barefoot through my hair
Naked on my lips
Love me to death, my precious
Smother me with kisses
Drown me in your waves of falling sweetness
Hold me dear, bury me deep
Bless me with your word of savage honour
We love more by fate than design
So give me your hand and I'll gladly give you my life
A flower, that sways in the breeze
You must be stronger than the winds that blow you away
Blow you away
Love me to death, my precious
Run barefoot through my hair
Dance wild on my lips
Love me to death, my flower
Lay me down on your bed of petals
Cover me with your honey, my blossom
Love me to death
Love me to death
Love me to death, my flower
Love me to death, my treasure
Run barefoot through my hair
Dance wild on my heart
Love me to death, my precious
Love me to death, my love
Tarnish, taint and punish me softly
Softly love me to death
Love me to death




 You're a sycophantic, bullshitting, cock sucking, arse licking, mercenary
Mind numbing, money grabbing, motherf**king scum of the earth, mercenary
You're a cringing, grovelling chicken shit, pissing waste of time
You're a crawling, whining hypocrite, you f**king piece of slime
You can take the money and run, but there's nowhere you can hide
You arsehole mercenary
Send you woman I done by(?)
But you took me for a ride, you shitty mercenary
You're a parasite of the f**king world, cockroach I wanna kill
If I don't catch you first then instant karma will
So screw you, f**k you
Screw you, f**k you
You're a cringing, grovelling chicken shit, pissing waste of time
You're a crawling, whining hypocrite, you f**king piece of slime




 I wanna feel again the thrill of the first kiss
I've never wanted anything more than this
I wanna feel again the blinding sheer delight
My senses scorched desire that flames so bright
I'm mesmerized hypnotized by you
I'm mesmerized so beguiled by you
I'm mesmerized by you
There's too many years and an ocean between us
And in the eyes of the world I'm scorned as a libertine
But you are my muse you are my Venus
And I watch move devotion comes serene
I'm mesmerized hypnotized by you
I'm mesmerized so beguiled by you
I'm mesmerized by you and your sea green eyes
One glance and I'm mesmerized
Entrance and I'm hypnotize by you

 Don't care none for temptation
It's like the good lord jesus said
Lock horns with the devil himself and
You'll end up in his bed
And where there are no shadows
No demons can ever exist
Would you throw this all away
For the sake of a wanton kiss?
There must be more than this
There must be more than this
I know you think you walk on water
But have you ever walked on air?
Cast no aspersion, this ain't no desertion
This is just calling it fair
And when temptation takes a hold of you
How can you ever resist?
Would you throw this all away for the flick
Of a perfumed wrist?
Judge not lest ye be judged, let
He who has no sin throw the first stone
Shower me with flowers, place them on my grave
Give me the grace for the sins I atone
I don't know the difference 'tween right and wrong, I
Don't understand the sense of regret and virtue
I want you to know Ä± never meant to cause you harm
I'm sorry but I never meant yo hurt you




 Oh, Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs. Pleasant?
I hope the world is treating you right and your head's in the air
And you're feeling so proud 'cause you're such a success
'Cause the whole wide world is on your side, hey hey
How are you today? People say Mr. Pleasant's good, Mr. Pleasant's kind
Mr. Pleasant's OK, Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's alright, hey hey
How are you today? How's your father? How's your mother
How's your sister? How's your brother?
How's your brand new limousine? 24 inch TV screen?
Do you like prosperity more than you like poverty?
Life is easier, so much easier, life is easier, now
Oh, Mr. Pleasant, how is Mrs. Pleasant? Did you know she was flirting
Around with a lovely young man? And he's taking her out, when you
Have to work late
So it's not so pleasant after all, hey hey
How are you today? People say Mr. Pleasant's good, Mr. Pleasant's kind
Mr. Pleasant's OK, Mr. Pleasant don't mind
As long as Mr. Pleasant's alright, hey hey
How are you today? La la la...
As long as Mr. Pleasant's alright, hey hey




 The cool cruel sleaze, hungry and wild and crawling
Through the storm that breaks
And clears away the vicious and violent heat
Breathe deep, breathe long and hard
Kiss and caress the hand that feeds
Love me primitive betraying lips
And the treacherous heart of the savage breed
Hollow eyes only cry hollow tears
And the tingling flesh that melts away
The scars and fears that the shameless years
Leave laughing and dancing
On a wasted and tattered dream
Cry hollow tears, that stifle the tortured kiss and scream
Screaming in the darkness, torn and ravaged
Spinning round in circles
Animal crazy and the howl of the naked and savage
The cool cruel sleaze hungry and wild and crawling
Through the storm that breaks
And clears away the vicious and violent heat
Breathe deep, breathe long and hard
Kiss and caress the hand that feeds
Love me primitive, betraying lips
And the treacherous heart,of the savage breed
Screaming in the darkness, torn and ravaged
Spinning round in circles
Animal crazy and the howl of the naked and savage
Tarnish, taint and punish me softly
Kiss the heavens where the angels tread
Love is the corpse that crawls on dreams
Rips them apart and tears them to shreds
Screaming in the darkness, torn and ravaged
Spinning round in circles
Animal crazy and the howl of the naked and savage




 It's never been like this
It's never been like this, no I've never felt like this before
And it was just around sunrise when you crept out the door
Left me ragged and worn but left me
Left me wanting more, more, more
Let's do this all again
Let's do this all again
Let's do it all again
Let's do this all again, do it all again sometime
Sometime
And do you remember Paris in the rain?
And it looks just like Christmas
But that's come and gone again
And the wild cats roaming in among the tombs and graves
And the flickering white neon of the cross and "Jesus Saves"
And the headlights like fires and the crowds in the streets
Children dressed in rags begging at our feet
And we crawled back to our room
With our heads spinning 'round
And we just lay in the dark
And didn't dare make a sound
And a sorrow soft as whispers stole into our hearts
Lay down between us and pushed us apart
And do you remember the silence scorched with pain?
A burning regret, let's never do this again
Again
Let's never do this again




 Sometimes I feel so old I wanna die
Feel like I'm sick at heart
Sometimes I just wanna break down and cry
Feel like I'm falling apart
Angel come and rescue me
Angel come and take my hand
Angel come and rescue me
Come and take my hand, come with me to Neverland
(Live version: rescue me from Neverland)
Sometimes I feel like a candle burning down
Feel like my flame is getting dim
Sometimes I feel like a ship that's run aground
Feel like I'm twisted by the wind
Angel come and rescue me
Angel come and take my hand
Angel come and rescue me
Come and take my hand, come with me to Neverland
So weary and so tired I close my eyes but sleep just won't come
So messed up and wired, I feel so old and I
Wanna die, feel so cold and I'm sick of trying
Feel so cold, feel so numb
Angel come and rescue me
Angel come and take my hand
Angel come and rescue me
Come and take my hand, come with me to Neverland
Angel come and rescue me
Angel come and take my hand
Angel come and rescue me
Come and take my hand, come with me to Neverland




 A fleeting glance upon your silken face Medusa
And you can turn my heart and soul to stone
Thank you for the memory, the lasting first impression
Thank you for the steel, that cuts to the bone
Over the hills and far away there's a place that's paradise
Where we walked, walked, walked, walked, walked on in
Talked, talked, talked, talked of sharing dreams
Up and away, where angels dread to tread
Brave rolling thunder and snow storms and pie in the sky
Tangled skein of the marriage made in heaven
Oh why did you, why did you let all the flowers die
Over the hills and far away there's a place that's heaven
Where yours was the first kiss and yours was the last kiss
Over the hills and far away there's a place that's paradise
Where we walked, walked, walked, walked, walked on in
Talked, talked, talked, talked of sharing dreams
Higher and higher with treason, clear reason, are all men guilty?
The sound of laughter ringing true, shining through your childlike eyes
Sacred hearts, epitaphs, touched by winds of change
Oh why did you, how could you let all the flowers die?
Over the hills and far away there's a place that's heaven
Where yours was the first kiss and yours was the last kiss
Over the hills and far away there's a place that's heaven
Where yours was the first kiss, the everlasting kiss
Over the hills and far away there's a place that's paradise
Where we walked, walked, walked, walked, walked on in
Talked, talked, talked, talked of sharing dreams




 Hey sister moonshine ride the snake with me
Ride it long ride it hard
Ride it all the way with me
Hey sister moondance charm the snake for me
Charm it long charm it hard
Charm the skin from its back for me
And paradise will come tonight
In the comfort of your arms and the ritual and
The rite
And paradise shines so bright
Lead me a dance of veil in the silver of the
Moonlight and paradise
Paradise will shine like the moon tonight
Hey sister moonchild the wolf is howling at the moon
He howls long he howls hard
Howling for you sister moon
Hey sister moonshine hold me till the break of dawn
Hold me long hold me hard
Hold me till the shadows fade away
Hey sister moonlight kiss me with your honey lips
Kiss me long kiss me hard
Kiss me till my honey drips
Hey sister midnight love is over with the rising sun
Love me long love me hard
This could be forever if you love me right




 I'm sick and tired of this masquerade
I'm bored to death by the games we play
For to long now it's been a charade
Don't wanna stay around to piss on parade
Gotta get the hell outta here
Too late now to wrap me up in chains
Too late now to bite my tongue, stop me
Raising Cain
The chip on your shoulder is a monkey on my back
You steal the glory, I'll take the flak
Can't stand your accusations, your recriminations
It's time to jump this train cos we've crashed the station
Don't wanna take this ride no more
Too late now to wrap me up in chains
Too late now to bite my tounge, stop me
Raising Cain
The gift of masque was like pearls before swine
Too late now to wrap me up in chains
Too late now to bite my tounge, stop me
Raising Cain




 Don't say no without hearing the question
You'll never know what you may miss
And bear in mind it's just a suggestion
But we both know what follows a kiss
Let fate conspire her design
And come and put your hand in mine
I don't look back I don't reminice
'cos there is nothing that I miss
There is no dawn without a night
There is no shadow without light
What you desire is up to you
But I can make all your dreams come true
There's refuge here for a refugee
'cos in my arms there's sanctuary
Don't subscribe to flesh as temptation
Surrender to the pulse of your blood
In piety there is never salvation
Always the storm that brings the flood
It's no so hard to understand
With every promise comes demand
What you desire is up to you
But I can make all your dreams come true
Only the guilty live their lives
Looking over their shoulders with alibis in mind
There's refuge here for a refugee
'cos in my arms you'll find sanctuary




 The only way that I'll make the papers
These days is if I load a gun
And fire a bullet into my brain
But then again the hackneyed hacks
Will only write I'm only jumping
Someone else's train it's always the same
And I can't begin to tell you now
How many strange beds I have known
I was never one to kiss and tell
But I do have a scandal to sell
Didn't your mother tell you don't run with scissors?
You might just fall and hurt yourself
They could impale you so don't run with scissors
'Cause being stabbed is not good for your health
No I won't confess all of my sins
'Cause some of my sins are your sins too
I'd rather die on my feet
Than live down on my knees
It's a dangerous game running with scissors
Wouldn't wish you to fall and hurt yourself
It's such a crying shame to see you running with scissors
But stabbing yourself is exactly what you deserve
So why don't you put those scissors down before you hurt someone?




 Tarot strewn across the floor
Fate creeps under the creaking door
Say farewell to the salad days
Arms held out for the needle haze
Scars, scars start to show
But don't, don't despair for the shame I know
Bible for the love and damned
Religion for the pagan man
Faith and prayer for the chosen few
Mystic shades of violent hue
Blood, blood on my cheeks
And the taste
The taste of ash curls across my tongue
Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burn
Rape and pillage the sacred word
Heart of darkness crowned and stirred
Rite of passage reckless whirl
Fruit forbidden ritual swirl
And you, what can you do?
And I, I say there's nothing you can do to stop this
Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burn
Tarot strewn across the floor
Fate creeps under the creaking door
Say farewell to the salad days
Arms held out for the needle haze
Scars, scars start to show
But don't, don't despair for the shame I know
Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burn




 Mistress of Avalon cast a spell and let the mist draw down on me
Slumber in lavender and take the primrose path to the eternal sea
The dragon's breath of shadow land
Resting on the waves and drifting across the sand
Maiden of Lorelei, the sweetness of your song calls my ship across the blue
Treasure rests upon your shore
The seagulls cry for sailors lost on their voyage to you
Harbour lies in your embrace
And my ship sets sail for that resting place
A ship of dreams on the sea of love
And if wishes are stallions
Then kisses are galleons
And dreamers sail on the sea of love
On the sea of love
Angel of evermore my saviour from the heavens above
With healing in your wings
The beauty of the melting snow the perfume of the
Mountain flower springtime brings
The ocean waves on desert shores
The coast the ship of dreams explore
Dreamers sail on the sea of love
On the sea of love




 Foreign tongues in familiar places
Surrender the thrills to the very core
Forever young and blessed with nameless graces
A love that kills and promises more
Ash on the carpet and dust on the mirror
Chasing shadows and the dreaming comes clearer
Gasping for colour, this perfect heart
Screaming howl and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
Whiskey and the devil and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower
Searching for a haven, it's no favour
The fingers that shine
Heart beats quicker as the veils start to fall
I'll be craving, the pleasure's all mine
Candles flicker as the devils dance on the wall
Stroking the naked and the silence gets colder
Stuck on the ceiling and the kissing gets bolder
Biting my nails for fear of revenge
A serpent's kiss and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
A serpent's kiss and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower
Ash on the carpet and dust on the mirror
Chasing shadows and the dreaming comes clearer
Some kind of visitor and the neon street
A serpent's kiss and the children play
A serpent's kiss for the words you pray
A serpent's kiss and the witching hour
A serpent's kiss on that untouched flower




 She's got her head in the clouds
She's got the stars in her eyes
And she's dancing
With a dream in her heart
She's got the wind in her hair
Moon child shining bright
And she's dancing
With a dream in her heart
Severina, Severina
She believes in angels
She believes in will of the Gods
And she's dancing
Amongst the magic dust
She believes in the midnight trance
She believes in love is the law
She's dancing
Amongst the magic dust
Severina, Severina
Star child
Baby born of heaven
Severina, Severina
She's got a heart full of promise
She's got a hand in her heart
She's dancing
By the light of the moon
She's got a head full of secrets
Sworn to the faith of love on the will
She's dancing
By the light of the moon
Severina, Severina
She's a gift to the Gods
She's dancing
Severina, Severina, Severina




 I'm lying in the dark listening to the rain
Reminds of you and makes me me sad all over again
Your measured swoons and sighs
Your hand me down whispered alibis
And it's easy to forgive but it's so hard, so hard to forget
And it's easy to see how deceit, deceit becomes regret
I can see now we're apart
How your mind played tricks on my heart
I never knew that you were untrue
There's so many shades of green
And I never believed that you would ever deceive
There's so many shades of green, so many shades of green
So sleep with your snakes and enjoy their viper's kiss
I want you know there's nothing about that I miss
I don't wish you any pain
But I don't ever want to see you again
So just shut your mouth
I've heard it all before
Shut it, just shut it
I don't wanna hear any more
I never knew that you were untrue
There's so many shades of green
And I never believed that you would ever deceive
There's so many shades of green
And you never knew that I was also untrue
There's so many shades of green
And you never believed that I could ever deceive
There's so many shades
So many shades of green




 I've been too drunk to love
Too drunk to care
I've looked like death, felt like hell
Been the worse for wear
I've been drinking too much to remember
The hell of the night before
I've been drinking myself blind
And still I'll drink some more
She is the wine that makes harps and choirs
The sweetest sound that the grapevine brings
She is the wine that makes gods and angels
And when I drink of her, she conjures me wings
She invites me to her banquets
And I feast on her bouquet
She chases the dragons, and
Drives the demon away
She builds a rainbow bridge
To the island of the blessed
She leads me to surrender
To the quarry of my quest
She is the temptress
The master magician
A sister to eros
She is exhibition
She plays like a symphony
Smells like sympathy
Tastes like poetry
Gives her very soul to me




 I will carry a torch for you
The flame will burn forever and strong
And I will light the way for you
When the night is dark and long
And I'll shine
I'll shine like the stars for you
I'll shine like the sun and moon
I'll rise like the wind for you
I'll rise like the sun
I'll rise like the moon
I'll shine like the stars for you
I will be the strength for you
When you are frail and weak
And when you shiver and shake with cold
I will be the warmth that you seek
And I'll shine
I'll shine like the stars for you
I'll shine like the sun and moon
I'll rise like the wind for you
I'll rise like the sun
I'll rise like the moon
I'll shine like the stars for you
And I'll shine
I'll shine like the stars for you
I'll shine like the sun and moon
I'll rise like the wind for you
I'll rise like the sun
I'll rise like the moon
I'll shine like the stars for you




 First I'm gonna f**k you and then we'll make love
Baby it's been too damn long
I'll conquer every orifice, scream at the heavens above
Where have all the angels gone
I want to take you in my mouth
Take you deep inside
Take you for a trip
Take you for a ride
I'll feed your every hunger
Do whatever you want me to do
It's not so strange how the medicine effects you
And I'll be a slave
I'll be a servant to lust
Slave to lust
I'll be a slave to lust
Slave to lust
I just wanna leave this world for a little while
I wanna feel like the God you want me to be
I want high ascension, fast love and exultation
I know you understand this need in me
I'm sick of masturbation tired of playing with myself
Don't wanna go to hell. Don't wanna go blind
As sure as the river flows and ebbs out to the sea
I'll give you everything I have if you'll blow my mind
And I'll be a slave
I'll be a servant to lust
Slave to lust
I'll be a slave to lust
Slave to lust
Being off your face can be a beautiful place
When you're there with the one you love
And I always knew and know you did too
That too much is never enough
I'm a slave to lust
Slave to lust




 Put the black crepe and the coolin' board away
Take the bunting down I ain't leaving town today
The choice is yours and so is the consequence
You don't win no medal for sitting on the fence
Sometime the warmest smile comes from the saddest face
Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place
Don't talk of ghosts while the sun still shines
There's gold aplenty waiting in the mines
I have no fear of death but I am scared of dying
And the heaven they are selling I just ain't buying
Sometimes the truest kiss comes with a whore´s embrace
Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place
Sleep is for dreamers and dreaming is for fools
If you've got guilt to carry then know carrying's for mules
It's the fate of man to live not as God
Whoever wrote the book was such a silly sod
Sometimes the fastest thrill comes from the longest chase
Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place
Death never takes the wise man by surprise
But who here among us can call themselves wise
God whispers in my ear that my halo is aflame
It's too easy to look for someone else to blame
Sometimes the weakest man fights with the strongest faith
Sometimes the biggest prizes comes from the shortest race
Sometimes the slightest sigh fills up the biggest space
Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest place




 Save me, save me, save me from the spider, begs the fly
I'm caught in her web and she's bleeding me dry
She wears her seduction like the bride wears her veil
She promised me Heaven but all she gives me is Hell
Oh no, no she's pulling me under
She's dragging me down, tearing me asunder
I'm sweating hot steel bullets, my mouth is bone dry
My heart beats too fast,can't catch my breath
The spider the spider traps the fly
She dresses in white but her heart's as black as sin
Her legs are wrapped around me feel her crawl across my skin
As she sucks the life outta me. I can't fly anymore
And I shiver and I shudder and surrender to the whore
Oh no, no, no, no, no she's dragging me under
She's pulling me down, tearing me asunder
I'm sweating hot steel bullets, my mouth, my mouth is bone dry
My heart beats too fast, can't catch my breath
The spider, the spider's trapped the fly




 I'll cry myself to sleep 'cause you're not here by my side
I'll cry 'cause you're not with me, with me tonight
I'll cry myself a river and drown in a torrent of tears
I'll cry 'cause the stars have thrown down all their spears
The stars don't shine without you
And it makes me, makes me sad and blue
The stars don't shine without you
And there's nothing, no nothing I can do
I'll cry 'cause the stars don't shine for me no more




 Books and covers and part time lovers
Spinning in rooms in cities of rust
I'm stranded, struck out on this line
There's smoke and fire and steel and wire
And glass and spire and dust
One to the floor at dawn with lips tied and drawn
Sleepless nights spent, with angels heaven sent
Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me
All of us lying there in the dreams
Speak of days and another place
I wander as the gypsy under a beckoning moon
Speak of time, and another face
They would in languid cry a fleeting furtive sigh
From the cradle to the grave love to desire and crave
Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me
I'll laugh for you, and I'll dance for you
But don't ask me to she'd any tears when I have to go
You are a joy and a pleasure to love and to hold
Your promises, are as pure as the driven snow
Passing shapes in the night the touch distraut and light
As you brightly shine, your love tonight is mine
Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me
Stay, with me
Stay, with me




 I know I am a legend 'cause I've seen my name
Slandered on a dirty subway wall
Sticks and stones may break my bones but names don't hurt
Names can't hurt me at all
You can crucify me
I will rise again
You can crucify me
I will stand alone
You bask in the light that pours from me
But that's just the way the world is mine
That's just the way all stars must shine
Assassination by vitriol and your quill is a loaded gun
Your finger on the trigger baby, trigger baby, trigger baby
But your dumb dumb bullets, dumb dumb bullets
Can never hurt anyone




 You feed my addiction so I will depend on you
You ease my affliction and I will ascend with you
My heroine you're the steel that breaks my skin
You are the needle in my vein
The drug that numbs the pain
You are the balm that soothes the wound
The walls of my cocoon
Still deep waters running deep
Running deep running deep over me
There's nothing I wouldn't do for one more fix of you
And there's nothing I want more
Then the searing heat I felt with you before
I'm climbing the wall I can't face the withdrawal can't take it at all
So please don't deny the craving that I
I feel for you




 At the crossing of the border between the night and day
Where the lost and lonely find their twilight sway
And the curse of their existence is the loneliness they feel
Where waking up with a stranger's the only thing from them that's real
So don't sing me your swan song, baby
There's life left in this ol' dog yet
It ain't over 'til it's over until the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til it's over until the swan spreads
Her wings
And flies away
When you see the ache of lovers as they fumble
In the night
And you feel the wrench inside you as any ex lover might
You can say your time is over for love and all the heat
But a single stranger's kiss can always turn
The bitter into sweet
So don´t sing me your swan song, baby
There's still gas left in this tank
It ain't over 'til it's over until the fat lady sings
It ain't over 'til it's over until the swan spreads
Her wings
And flies away
You're wonderful
You're beautiful
Just give me your hands




 I'm not the animal I used to be but you
Shouldn't speak ill of the dead
I've never been just one of the boys, I've never hidden guns under the bed
I feel like Jesus, I feel betrayed, and you know
Damn well that I feel crucified
Assassination, shot full of vitrial, there's so
Many more heroic ways to die
I close my eyes and I start to drift away
I close my eyes and I start to sway
Lie back and think of England I'll just fake it some more
A carrion feast for the ravens and the crows
I know my price and I'll be your whore and I
Don't care if the whole damn world knows
I feel so jaded, so tired and so worn
I feel like I've got nothing left to say
I'll be a martyr, a brave little soldier cos
There's so many demons left to purge and slay
I close my eyes and I start to drift away
I close my eyes and I start to sway
Trapped in the eye of a hurricane
Taking a ride on a runaway train
Behind the wheel of a crashing car
Caught in the trail of a falling star
Can't turn my back without a blade digging deep
It's more than enough to make a grown man cry
The God in me is the, the devil in you, there's
Many more beautiful ways to die
I close my eyes and I start to drift away
I close my eyes and I start to sway




 I wanna fly with Peter Pan
I wanna go with Alice to Wonderland
I wanna pitch ball to Shoeless Joe
I wanna roam the plains with the buffalo
Ohoh, ohoh, and before I die
Ohoh, ohoh, and before I die all I wanna do
Is swim with the dolphins
I wanna fly with Peter Pan
I wanna go with Alice to Wonderland
I wanna walk the Yellow Brick Road
I wanna buy back the dreams I sold
Ohoh, ohoh, and before I die
Ohoh, ohoh, and before I die all I wanna do
Is swim with the dolphins




 I, more than adore you
Naked, standing before you
Hold out your arms
And open yourself wide
Hold me dear
Bury me deep inside
Feel, feel the glow
You make me swoon
I, wanna turn you on
Wanna take you high
Sleight of hand
Slip of the tongue
Sweet, how sweet you taste
And the heat
The heat you make
You make me swoon, you make me swoon
I, more than adore you
Naked, standing before you
Hush, baby hush
Rush, here comes the rush
You make me swoon, you make me swoon
You make me swoon, you make me swoon




 I can't believe that you've been faking all this time
That's such a spiteful thing to say
I can't believe you never really cared
How am I supposed to know that you feel this way?
I don't see how it matters now
That tears shall drown the wind
I don't see why it makes you cry
That tears shall drown the wind
I never promised you that the stars would come to us
You have to know I never lied
I know you feel it's like waiting for the end of the world
Sometimes it's easy just to let it, let it slide
There ain't no sense in making accusations
No matter if you're wrong you're always right
There ain't no point in recrimination
I really don't have the strength to put up a fight




 Brother of Cain, but I'm not Abel
To see the word from the trees
I'm all at sea, come hell and high water
Before I drown, kiss me please
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round, and around
Shake me down
Here comes the sun, streaming through the window
Colour up the dust and making it shine
The devil's domain is the crystal ocean
Wave after wave, in time after line
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake me down
Shake me down
Shake me down
Flesh and blood, sister in crime
Cross my heart and then hope to die
The blinding lights, done with mirrors
Reach for the blade and kiss the sky
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake me down
Shake me round and around
Shake me down




 It´s time of martyrs and assassins
Demostration reigns everywhere
Crowds of people young are amassing
There´s a revolution in the air
Anarchy and fighting on the city streets
A new voice is shouting loud in the searing heat
It´s time of prophets with protest songs
Tryin' to make it right their fathers wrongs
Rail against the picks of the grey haired guard
Fight against the bullies of the old school yard
Fists raining hard
Playground thugs - We all love the girl in a furskin rug
It´s time of butterflies on the wheel
Take a magic trip and they throw 'em in jail
And Sergeant pilcher he´s going down
What a clown
Planting drugs - On the girl in a furskin rug
I wasn´t there
Just too young for that
But I've watched the film and read the book
And though I swear It´s the same old hat
Nostalgia sells and we love the look - Of the girl in a furskin rug
The dream is over long time gone
The old brigade just carries on
It wass all a con
But I'd still love to hug - The girl in a furskin rug




 Sometimes I feel just like Jesus Christ
Nailed to the cross, betrayed and crucified
A crown of thorns cutting into my skin
A palace and a throne and a kingdom of my own
Knights in armour and courtesans, maids in waiting with blood on their hands
The king ??? can't get blood from a stone
I'm falling, into the arms of Nemesis
I'm falling, into the grip of disease
Cold comfort is success and I can feel my blood freeze
Reason with the dust and blown away by the breeze
How cruel the stars, that shine so hard
I'm falling, into the arms of Nemesis
I'm falling, into the grip of
Disease
?? and all I ever need is the truth
But the truth of it all is that there's no truth at all
Like the truth of the cry from the new born child
So why? Just tell me why, does Jesus cry?
I'm falling, into the arms of Nemesis
I'm falling, into the grip of disease
I'm falling, into the arms of Nemesis
I'm falling, into the grip of disease
Disease, disease, disease




 I still remember the very first kiss
And the blood on the sheets
And like the stars that shoot through the night
We crash and burn in the heat
There's never any shadow if don't have light;
The darkest hour comes before dawn
And Heaven knows the colour you bring to everything
And love will always defeat brawn
You blaze like the neon in a Tokyo night
You dazzle and you shine so bright
You brun like the sun and I can't look away
I'm being blinded by the light that pours from you
And to be tempted by hunger for the flesh
No refuge from our appetites
And beauty comes from always deep within
It's easy to be tricked by the light
I don't have to tell you always how I feel
Some things are better left unsaid
For temples are built in union and faith
Let's tame your wild stallions instead
You blaze like the neon in a Las Vegas night
You dazzle and you shine so bright
You brun like the sun and I can't look away
I'm being blinded, blinded by the light that pours from you
I still remember the very fist time
My eyes were seared by you
And from that blinding moment all I've wanted to do
Is lose myself deep in you
You blaze like the neon in a Tokyo night
You dazzle and you shine so bright
You brun like the sun and I can't look away
I'm being blinded, blinded by the light that pours from you




 I want you to feel me I want you to take my hand I want yo to heal me I need you to undestand I want you to make me I want you and i´ll be damned i want you to break me Like the child that I am I want you to thrill mr I want you to make me sceam I want you to kill me To die by your hands




 Don't ask me to choose when you give me no choice
And does it make you sigh when you hear my voice?
I don't wanna be raped I wanna be seduced
And if you open your arms I will call a truce
'Cause I don't understand what drives a man
To love and to kill with the very same the very same hand
And God cursed man when he made woman bleed
You broke the code you dishonoured the creed
And you dance to the beat of a different drum and you're under the
Thumb and more lucky than some
And we can never know when the last kiss will come
'Cause I don't understand what drives a man
To love and to kill with the very same the very same hand
Does it make me weak to turn the other cheek
Don't bind yourself with promises




 You raise me up when I'm on the floor
You see me through when I'm lonely and scared
And I'm feeling true to the written word
And you're true to me but still I need more
It would tear me apart to feel no-one ever cared
For me
For me
Me
You are a tower of strength
To me
You stand firm and proud when the wind blows in your face
And when the sun shines in your eyes you just turn your head away
To me
To me
Me
You are a tower of strength
To me
You rescue me, you are my faith, my hope, my liberty
And when there's darkness all around
You shine bright for me, you are a guiding light
To me
To me
Me
You are a tower of strength
To me
You are all passion and heart when I lay in your embrace
And heaven is in your kiss, salvation lies just a touch away
To me
To me
Me
You are a tower of strength
To me

 It was the word from Milo, A word to the wise
That set me straight about your cheating and your lies
Set down between us like the bottle that we shared
He had to tell me because noone else dared
I'm so disappointed
I'm so very, very let down
And you can have the bed and the stains on the sheets
I'll sleep on the floor, I can't bear your deceit
You gave yourself away for the sake of a thrill
For the price of my conceit, you were a steal
I'm so devastated
I'm so very, very let down
You leave a trail of scarlet like footsteps in the snow
You leave a trail of scarlet everywhere you go
And I'm the last to know
And isn't it just like you to shake the faith in me?
I gave you all I have to give but I couldn't give you all you need
And something that had died was all we had to lose
And the worst thing I ever did to you was ask you to choose
I'm so very lonely
I'm so very, very let down
You leave a trail of scarlet like footsteps in the snow
You leave a trail of scarlet everywhere you go and I'm
The last to know
And didn’t we once have it all? held it in our hands
But it’s too easy to deceive a trust that makes no demands
You leave a trail of scarlet like footsteps in the snow
You leave a trail of scarlet everywhere you go and I'm the last to know




 Buried deep, buried deep inside
The hurting and the pain I've got to hide
It's cold and it's dark and it's raining outside
Never another sunset until there's another
Another sunrising up
Like a mountain from the sea
Against the pain
The walls I build, the bridges I burn
So I'll never get hurt again
It's cold and it's dark and I'm feeling numb
Never another sunrise until there's another
Another healing time come
Hiding away in my ivory tower, my fortress, my sanctuary
Until the healing comes, quiet and sure, like a mistress visiting me
It's cold and it's lonely but there's a light shining in my eyes
There's another sunset until there's another
Until there's another sunrise




 The tried and the trusted talk of plans
Master, past and present
Heartless wordplay, and dreams of revenge
Living on the edge, the razor edge, living on the razor edge
One day we'll look back at this
And laugh and laugh and we'll die laughing
One day we'll look back at this and laugh
Pillar of wisdom and soul of iron
Alone, in the crumbling tower of power
All your friends are dead and buried, they died laughing
All your friends are dead and buried
My heart would bleed for you if I wasn't a victim
My heart should bleed for you
Circumstance, eternal, forever
For the love of god, it's a crying shame
For the love of god
Treasure the moments touched with joy
But the remember the moments, tarnished and stained
For you, sunshine, for you
It's a taste of your own medicine
God's own medicine for you
Wake, wake for you
Wake for you
Wake, wake for you my precious
Wake for you




 I still believe in God
But God no longer believes in me
There's a crystal view from my window
And I can see years to come
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun
I can tear down the walls, storm the barricades
Run to the place where the frightened crawl
Desire lurks beyond good and evil
So I dance on the graves where the hallowed fall
Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland
You can touch, but please keep your distance
You're innocent and pure and with no shame
The spirit is willing, and the flesh is craved
You tease and you taunt with the pleasure of pain
Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland
Heaven and Hell, I know them well
But I haven't yet made my choice
I'm feeling scared 'cause I'm shouting loud
And no one can hear my voice
I'm walking the tightwire, can't look down
Strung out high, above you all
Fateful wind blows through this land
Howls my name, heralds my fall
Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

 Cloaked in black like the stars, so wrapped up in yourself you are
The needle taste sweeter by far than the cold light of day
And as you become enslaved to the puppy that you grief
There is nothing I can do to save you from slipping away
And I just wanted, just needed to say
I hate to see you wasting away, just wasting away
So when you just can't take anymore and the nappy comes too full of pain
You reach for the comfort of your white stallion again
And I just wanted, just needed to say
I hate to see you wasting away, just wasting away
Just wasting away
I've seen the fire die away, I've seen the sunset in your eyes
I've seen the darkness coming down and I just needed to say good bye
So you're dancing with the candy man, he's saving the last words for you
And as he leads you away by the hand there is nothing I can do
There is nothing I can do
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you




 How the hell do you know that it's going to snow?
What are you now if you're not the weatherman?
And when our worlds collide and you take a side
What are you doing tonight 'cos we can be together man?
Together forever man forever tonight
I feel a little bit giddy cos I think you're so pretty
And you can do what you want with me cos you've got me bound tethered man
Together such a clever man I'm the whether the whether man
Take me to your netherland togeteher forever man
Whatever
And I don't understand how you can say on the other hand
That all of this charade is planned and in advance
And how on earth can you believe that I would be so damn naive and
So easy to deceive with just a glance well not a chance what a song and dance
Are you furious I'm only curious?
Hmm you're so vicious hit me with a feather man
Together however man never say never man
Together whatever man I'm the whether the whetherman
It's a plan




 They herded us down to the station
Straight onto the cattle train
We ain't been told our destination
But We know we won't be back this way again
So tell me how, how in God's name, will the saints ever find us
When the trap clicks shut behind us
They locked the doors and you and I
We were packed like sardines in a tin
There ain't no room to sit or lie
We're just waiting here for our journey to begin
So how the hell, in the good Lord's name, will the saints ever find us
When the trap clicks shut behind us
Take care not to suffer in your own homes what has been
Inflicted on us here
Heed the lesson well and always remember don't let
The memory dissapear
We rode for days in that railway car
No fod or water or light to see
And no one hears our scream and cries
When they take our lives They'll set us free
So tell me how, how in God´s name, will the saints ever find us
So I'll tell you now, and with no shame, that death will never bind us
When the trap clicks shut behind us




 She brings me colours, white wine and roses
And then we paint our faces and pwder our noses
She gives me her halo and I hang it next to mine
Reads to me Mishima like a honeymoon valentine
She's an architect of pleasure and she fashions me a fountain
She leads me through the clouds to the peak of the highest mountain
We dare the heavens on a chariot that we borrow
Tonight she is my cradle, but
Who will love me tomorrow?
Cold turkey Cindy pulls the mirrors from the wall
Walks barefoot on the broken glass and stumbles in from the hall
She's shooting paper tigers with the needle that she's borrowed
Tonight she is my pillow, so
Who will love me tomorrow?
Must I sing so low to get so high?
I can't purge myself of demons and I don't know the reason why
My heart feels like a battlefield and all my soldiers lie slain
I'll never be clean, I'll never be pure again
She greets me like a siren and all her lights are flashing
She invites me to her dungeon with the promise of a lashing
And with a smile like a sunrise playing on her lips
She shows me her collections of butterflies, scars, and whips
With fingernails like claws she leaves keepsake souvenirs
Like trenches on my back she bathes in saccharine scented tears
I feel just like an actor in a play called "Dear Friend Sorrow"
Tonight she is my refuge, but
Who will love me tomorrow?




 Gypsy in my blood
And I lie where the myth is sold
Cross my palm with silver
And I'll give you my heart of gold
Steal away my crystal ball
And bring me in from the cold
And it's fair to say there's no comfort here
No hands to hold and treasure dear
You could very well be the very death of me
Crawling 'round your floor
On my hands and knees
All caution to the wind
Taken by the breeze
No grave concern for repercussion
No room for talk or brave discussion
Well I never
But the devil may care
I'm coming in
On a wing and a prayer
Snowbound daze
Leaves me high and dry
And I swear there's more to me than meets your hollow eyes
Throw me a line I'm sinking fast
I'm not yet willing to die
My secret's safe with you I trust
Show me faith and give me dust
Well I never
But the devil may care
I'm coming in
On a wing and a prayer
The devil always fools
With the best laid plans
And never can I meet
With all your choice demands
It goes against the grain
To place my life in your hands
I'll take the flak if you'll take the blame
Well I never
But the devil may care
I'm coming in
On a wing and a prayer
Well I never
But the devil may care
I'm coming in
On a wing and a prayer




 Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
No, you're not going anywhere
Run around the town, singing your blues
No, you're not going anywhere
You've always been a good friend of mine and you always said farewell
But the only time that you're satisfied is when your feet's in the wishing well
Throw down your gun, you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're trying to do
Put up a fight you believe to be right
Someday the sun will shine through
You've always got something to hide, something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied is when your feet's in the wishing well
And I know what you're wishing for
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world
Love in a peaceful world
You've always been a good friend of mine and you always said farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied is when your feet's in the wishing well
Wishing well
Wishing well
Yeah




 I never knew how much you could mean to me
Until the moment you saw how untrue I could be
I never meant to cause you sorrow
Never meant to cause you any pain
But with all the best intentions
I can't promise I won't do it again
I don't know what it is that drives me to make me want to throw it all away
'Cause you're really very precious, and I do so dearly want you to say
It gets harder all the time, to be away from you
And I want to work it out, so you can grow to trust me too
Like I trust you
Time is not the healer, I was hoping he would be
And I'm still tender and bruised, but I want you to touch me
'Cause there's a healing in your touch
And you're the one I need to be with
I want to give myself to you, give you all I have to give
You make me live
You make me breathe
You make me breathe
