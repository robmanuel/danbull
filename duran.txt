Now I dialed nine one one a long time ago
Don't you see how late they're reacting
They only come and they come when they want to
So get the morgue truck and bag the goner
They don't care 'cause they get paid anyway
They treat you like an ace that can't be betrayed
I know you stumble with no use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Late comings with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise
Y'all I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers
Quick they come to fetch you
With an autopsy ambulance
Just to dissect ya
They are the kings 'cos they swing amputation
Lose your arms your legs to them it's compilation
I can prove it to you watch the rotation
It all adds up to a funky situation

So get up get get get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up get get get down
Late 911 wears the late crown
911 is a joke 

Everyday they don't never come correct
You can ask my man right here
With the broken neck
He's a witness to the job never being done
He would've been in full effect 911
They the token to your life when it's croaking
They need to be in a pawn shop on a
911 is a joke we don't want 'em
I call a cab 'cause a cab will come quicker
The doctors huddle up and call a flea flicker
The reason that I say that 'cause they
Flick you off like fleas
They be laughing at ya
While you're crawling on our knees
And to the strength so go the length
Thinking you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor
Cause 911 is a fake life saver




 Guess you know
Where I want to go
Got to see the water flow
Try to understand
Got me trapped
Playing with me like a cat
Scrape your fingers down my back
Pin me to the ground

All along the water baby
Take me to your water babe
All along the water babe

I get fired
Can't you see I'm burning up
When you come and turn it up
Higher every time
If I stay
Oh the end is near
Come and get me out of here
Come and get me now


Tell me is there any left
I want to drink it up
Drink it up
Baby, if there's any left
I'll drink it up, drink it up, drink it up

 It's all up to you now
Find yourself in the moment
Go directly to the voodoo
Now the channel is open
Lose your head
Lose control
You come on delicate and fine
Like a diamond in the mine




 How does it feel
When everyone surrounds you?
How do you deal?
Do crowds just make you feel lonely?
What do you say
When people come and try to pin you down?
Acquaintances smile
But that's no understanding
How, after a while
You keep falling off the same mountain
Try to explain it
But nothing really gets them that high

Steal away in the morning;
Love's already history to you
It's a habit you're forming
This body's desperate for something new
Just a matter of feeling
These moments of madness are sure to pass
And tears will dry as you're leaving
Who knows, you might find something to last

Emotion's a game
Saved up for a rainy monday
But you laugh just the same
'cause it's been pouring on sunday
Call up your numbers
And never let the zeros bring you down
How does it feel?
Is time too heavy to hold?
Whatever you decide for the moment is holy
Whenever you slow down to see life is passing by


A matter of feeling. A matter of feeling. 




 It's a little bit late now
But there's times you will
Get a little bit out of hand
Making all of a spill
And if we can lay this down
You're going all the way
Take a look and i'll check it out
Cause i can always find it

Such a lonely place. Ooh
This room without your face. Ooh

Ooh. American science
All night long she can two-step and sway
Ooh, it's such awful manners
Don't keep me waiting, come and lie beside me

A little megalomania becomes you, evidently
There ain't a thing you can acquire
With your cling-wrap plaything
Just look at this state
I crawl around in a daze
Like symptomatic case
Of your soul persuasion

Such a lonely place. Ooh
This room without your face. Ooh


Ooh, it's a little bit later now
And there's time you will let it all get
Out of hand when you feel you feel
I just switched on the operation
Such a lovely face. Ooh
It pulls me into place. Ooh

 I never found out what made you leave
And now the day is over, just an hour to go
I tried to phone last night but you didn't answer
Just left me ringing on the line
Outside is there anyone out there, anyone else outside
Outside love is there anyone out there, anyone else outside
My face in the mirror shows the break in time
A crack in the ocean which does not align
I tried to sleep last night but i've caught your dreaming
About days we used to wonder away
Outside is there anyone out there, anyone else outside
Outside love is there anyone out there, anyone else outside
Look out of the window maybe you can call by my name
Another night over babe another light comes on in vain
I tried to phone last night but you never answered
Just left me ringing in the air (outside)
Is there anyone out there
(anyone out there)

 Makes my hair stand up on end
Something alien happening
Synchronize but don't comprehend
Because where I stop that's where you begin!
Another moment I commit
A pleasure as I'm going to take the hit
And I'm addicted to the state you're in
'Cause you're getting me out of it!

Wasted, there's nothing going to ace this
And were going to go to space it
Because I'm leaving with an astronaut!

Grooving out to X-ray specks
Something tells me your the alien sex
I can't imagine now what comes next
When this astronaut connects!
Coming on when I touch your skin
A kind of strange light you emit
I hear you're gravity pull me in
Now your getting me out of it!


There, feat for quantum leap
Because space is hot and deep
And we follow giant footprints
As we fall in, falling like the twins
Through Saturn's holy rings
And if they can't hold us, where it's going to end up
Anybody knows




 Makes my hair stand up on end
Something alien happening
Synchronized but don't comprehend
Cos where I stop that's where you begin
I know the moment I commit
A pleasure rising when I take the hit
And I'm addicted to state you're in
Cos you're getting me out of it
Wasted
There is nothing gonna ace this
And we're gonna go to space, kid
Cos I'm leaving with an astronaut
Groovin-out to x-ray spex
Something tells me you're the alien sex
I can't imagine now; what comes next
When this astronaut connects?
Coming-on when I touch your skin
A kind of strange light you emit
I feel your gravity pull me in
Now you're getting me out of it
Wasted
There is nothing gonna ace this
And we're gonna go to space, kid
Cos I'm leaving with an astronaut
Bare-feet for quantum leap
Because space is hot and deep
And we follow giant footprints as we fall... in
Falling like the twins through Saturn's holy rings
And if they can't hold us
Where it's gonna end up - anybody knows
An a-stronaut, an a-stronaut
Wasted
There is nothing gonna ace this
And we're gonna go to space, kid
Cos I'm leaving with an astronaut
Wasted
There is nothing gonna ace this
And we're gonna go to space, kid
Cos I'm leaving with an astronaut
Boop-boop boop-boop boop-boop
An a-stronaut




 Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places, feel the chill
Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
A week is why, until we...

Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assassination standing still
Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...

 (Lebon, Rhodes, Cuccurullo, Taylor)
Early Morning
As the day is dawning
You're street gutter crawling
When the sun comes up
Baby Crying
Says today she's dying
But she's always lying
And that's a ball'n'chain
You got the ball'n'chain
You're in the ball'n'chain gang
Coz you're the ball'n'chain man
Bruises for breakfast
Ain't nobody's business
But pain's a lonely mistress
And you can't give up
(That's a ball'n'chain)
Flame burning
Money that you're earning
And you will be returning
With a ball'n'chain

Why do you love me
When you don't need me
Why do you want me all of the time?
In my whole life, didn't get no peacetime
And I don't care if I live or die
(that's a ball'n'chain)
You got the ball'n'chain
You got the ball'n'chain
You got the ball'n'chain
You got the ball'n'chain
You got the ball'n'chain
You got the ball'n'chain
You got the ball'n'chain
You got the Ball'n'Chain
You're the one to blame
You got to love that pain




 People moving out
People moving in
Why?
Because of the color of their skin
Run, Run, Run but you sure can't hide
An eye for an eye
A tooth for a tooth
Vote for me, I'll set you free
Rap on brother, rap on
Well the only person talking about love
Thy brother is a preacher
See, No body is interested in learning
But the teacher

Segregation
Domination
Demonstration
Integration
Aggrivation
Humiliation
Obligation to the nation

Ball of Confusion, Ball of Confusion
That's what your world today
Ball of Confusion, Ball of Confusion
That's what your world today

Is like an all time high
City's aflame in the summer time, and
Oh, The beat goes on
Evolution, Revolution, Evolution....
Gun Control, the sound of soul
Politicians, can you fucking believe them?
And the band played on
Round and around and around we go
Where ever we're standing no body knows
Take a look around
Can't you hear me talking to you?
Just a


See it in the air
Tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast
Killers gangs watch your ass
Gun control
The sound of soul




 (Le Bon, Rhodes, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor)
Today, riding the slow train along the way
Going to who knows where and who knows when
Not knowing where you're rolling - it's the learning of this journey
I feel if all of you people gather and believe
Being what makes you breathe in is enough
Promise to carry on from each moment to the next one
These beautiful colours, infinite patterns so hard I see
And if we're all of the same stuff there's not one of you who is the same as me
Woah, beautiful colours, indifferent for you to see
Sometimes the beauty of it all seems unbearable 'til the colours bleed
(keep breathing...)
Design - everyone's their own universe
Besides - life is a standard issue to customize
Ashes to understanding is the nature of existence
These beautiful colours, infinite patterns so hard I see
And if we're all of the same stuff there's not one of you is the same as me
Proud beautiful colours, indifferent for you to see
Sometimes the beauty of it all seems unbearable 'til the colours bleed
(keep breathing...)
Keep breathing
Keep loving
These beautiful colours, infinite patterns are what I see
And now if we're all of the same blood there's not one of you is the same as me
Crowds of beautiful colours, indifferent to what you believe
Sometimes the beauty of it all seems unbearable 'til the colours bleed
Keep breathing
Keep loving




 I been around the world
I seen a lot of things
That make your chicken curl
You're squeezing like boys and teasing like girls
Confusing like boys and girls
Plan an exit route, parachute, rubber suit
Are you ready for a little swim
There's regular, queen size, flip it on the b side, solid gold
Oh my God what's this?
I saw the bedroom toys
Now I'm stalling
I can't believe my eyes
I saw the bedroom toys
Now I'm crawling
I learn to improvise
Checking out the five star atmosphere
You want some expertise
If you got treasure, I'll pay you for the pleasure
It'll bring you to your knees
Silicone romance, what's your name fancy pants?
Got your eye on the employees
Forget about the reeling, talk about the feeling
Solid Gold
You want it, you got it, now what you going to do with it?
Now you washed up, beat smashing, grab no receipt takes the platinum off your shine
Lazy bed star, la di da, petty bourgeois
Oh my would you look at the time
Until you wise up, you know we're going to line up
The pimps and snitches to dip into your riches
If you can't destroy it, you might as well enjoy it

 A stormy summer
Is rolling closer
Lighting up this holy smoker
And if this drinking
Could ease the thinking
I toast to my home truth with this glass

All rise you promises broken
Call my lovers by their names
Lost hearts and words that are spoken to the wind
Which blows before the rain

Little pin-pricks
And how my ears bleed
On the bomb ticks that is my heartbeat
In every life-flash
In every car crash
I hear the silence waiting to fall


For all I carry
Are murdered secrets
The price of my blue star-eyed weakness
And so we travel
And we unravel
Towards the place where all loose ends go




 To the voyeur, seated in a darkened room
Do you thrill when the green light starts pulsing?
Paranoia, the only valid point of view
If you know what I'm saying

I'm not alone, being followed
Someone always watching what we do
Never alone, but I'm in the shadows
I dream things I don't want you to know

Something shifting between the sirens and the glow
Of red lights and the blue slowly turning
The fog is lifting
A silhouette begins the show
Then the moment is stolen


In this chamber lit by scandal
You're the bullet in the barrel
You're the last thing as I'm falling
Bloody roaring still I'm calling out
I'm calling out

I'm not alone, being followed
Never alone, I'm being followed




 I follow you, I wait for you
You know there's no escape from me
You're more than wallpaper in my room
I write you letters and bring you gifts
I'm going through all your trash
I love you so much
I keep your cigarette butts
Now is the time to come out
Come out of the shadows

No need to be scared
You're going to be so happy
I built you a shrine
Now you can be my icon

I'm out on the edge
There's no way back inside
All my friends are gone
They didn't understand me
It makes so much sense
It's no coincidence
Just you and I alone here
And I need you
Oh
How many hours have I stared at my face in the mirror
I get worried sometimes that the image will shatter


No need to be
Scared
Now you can be
My Icon

I know this is real
Believe it
We belong together
What ever happens
You're going to be with me forever
Be my icon
You will be my icon
Be my icon
You will be my icon




 Falling into space
At the end of time
Black as the black in your eye
Staring through a hole in the ozone
There's nobody home
To play back your ansaphone
Climax out of blue
Is it just another high?
No there must be something new
Now that I'm so alien

Entering the atmosphere
Don't know what is waiting here (oh no)
If there's nothing left to fear
When they come together in
The Big Bang Generation

Teardrop in the sky
Bursting my eye
Sound of morning sighs
This life is stranger than fiction
Surreal addiction
It's all I recognize
Feeding off the habit
Losing control
Where is it leading to?
Now that I'm the alien


(Feel like I'm losing control)
Big Bang Generation
(Now that I'm here alone)
Big Bang Generation
(Feel like I'm losing control)
Big Bang Generation
(Feel like I'm losing it)
We're going to come together here

Where you coming from?
When we going to burn out? Don't know
Having so much fun
Greetings from the Big Bang Generation
Big Bang Generation
Meet you in the Big Bang Generation
Together in the Big Bang Generation
Together we're the Big Bang Generation




 Get it up get it out get it in time
Hang it up hanging out hanging on a big thing
Move it in move it out move up the line
Bang it up bang it out banging on a big thing

Brothers and sisters let me hear it
Get it up get it on get it in time
Give me the green light and watch me move it
Move it up move it out move up the line
This is temptation power rotation
Give me the friction and watch me make it
Make it up making out making it slide

So glad you came along
This time you won't be wrong
You love to turn it on
And you're not the only one


Brothers and sisters we can take it
Shake it up shake it out shake it all the time
Give me the suction we can stick it
Lick it up suck it up stick it outside
This is temptation (station)
Power rotation (to station)
Give me the playlist and watch me eat it
Eat it up beat it up beat it in time


Get it up get it out get it in time
Hang it up hanging out hanging on a big thing
Move it in move it out move up the line
Bang it up bang it out banging on a big thing




 It is too nice to paint your eyes
I took a tear, I don't even want
We don't like, we don't like
The things they say
It takes true life, to you paint your eyes
You don't dare with your imagination
We don't like, we got some
We find you've failed
You don't wait around
You don't realise there's something else
You'd better lock yourself
That I don't think it is all been really there
It's said so the rumour's dead
But I don't say it
That is the world you paint beside
And in a 9 to 5 around town
He's obsessed to make it
You'll understand
Here's back to love, you made it out
I've never really, never really bored
He's obsessed to make it
You'll find yourself
Yeah
You don't believe it
Don't listen to everything you know
You're mine in, in your sacred letter
You're my baby
Your voice is so important to me
You've lied it, she's my babe to set a feeling
It's all on my back, you may see that
I'm not your man and your soul thing
You don't search the findings
The world's at stake
You might to love but might not to have
But there's a thing she made me every morning
I don't lie, cause I say
You're my best friend
You may like everything
And that's a fantastic story




 Box full of honey
At the sharp end of the view
The edge of me and you
And all good sense had tread no further
And as the ghost will shiver trees
How I'm trembling on my knees
But I'm still drawn on by the murmur

Are you laughing at me now
In my circumstance
When still I wear I your crown
My life's penitence
And for what
What's so funny
A box full of honey

What I thought a pretty tune
Was howling at the moon
To keep me company this evening
It's so lonely in the dirt
A scratching at the hurt
But I so generously did leave you


Is she flirting with me now
Ohh
Is she dallying with me now
Ohh
Ohhh
Are you flirting with me now
You'll always be my queen of tumble down
Miss melancholy




 Heaven loves ya
The clouds part for ya
Nothing stands in your way
When you're a boy
Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When you're a boy
When you're a boy
You can wear a uniform
When you're a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favourite things
When you're a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out
Uncage the colours
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy
They'll never clone ya
You're always first on the line
When you're a boy
When you're a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy
Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy
Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out




 Every day I wake up in this room
And I don't know
Where I come from
Where I'm going to
Then I hear the voice
Senhora musa da paz
Me abraca
Me carrega no teu andor
Dormir no colo da dor
Amiga, arrasa!
A tua mao desenhou
O sonho na areia
Agora, entrega de vez
Meu rumo
E vida

From where I stand
The truth isn't black and white
Alone we live and die
We love and fight
Breath after breath
We carry this mortal coil
Safe for tomorrow

Do I dare
Oh do I dare
Follow through the goorsteps
My whole body hears
Beating on my heart like a feather
Beating of a moment til I disappear
Diga uma palavra alegre
Manda um recado
Que seja agoca
Faz o mundo ficar novo
E dancar no colo do tal de amor

From where I stand
The truth isn't black and white
Alone we live and die
We love and fight
Breath after breath
We carry this mortal coil
Safe for tomorrow

Circles in sand are washed out into the sea
Just as we slip on through to eternity
Breath after breath
We carry this mortal coil
Safe for tomorrow
Diga uma palavra, cara
Bem alegre
Corre, manda logo um recado
Me abraca
Faz um clima doce
Me arrepia!
Chega de sufocol
Me poe louco!
Me faz diamante
Teu amante
Danca ao som do vento
Me ensina
Basta de sufoco
Nao faz jogo...

A flame of love is burning
Always
The song is of the planets
Oh whooooooo
The dance is to the rhythm of the rain
Where everyone is coming from
Is coming to
And birth is just a
Breath after breath




 Can't say that I was surprised
When you broke the ties
They were hanging by a thread
But now I have realized
It couldn't be the same
Because everything has changed
And still I held out my hand
Tried to pull you back
But you were buried in the sand
I'm glad that you came along
But here our journey ends
I say goodbye to you
My very dear friend

You were buried in the sand
Head buried in the sand
You are buried in the sand




 Barbarella
Mr. President
Your mission, find Duran Duran
Find Duran Duran
Just a minute, I'll slip something on
Can you hear me now?
Can, can, can you hear me now
Htrae tenalp si siht

I tell you somebody's fooling around
I tell you, I tell you
I tell you somebody's fooling around

Burning the ground

Girls
(Burning)
Boys
(Burning)



Why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Yeah

Da na na na, da na na na, da na na na daa
(Fle fle fle fle flex)
Da na na na, da na na na, da na na na daa
(Fle fle fle fle flex)




 By the look on your face you've been awake all night
It started raining in the early light
You're fooling the mirror but you don't fool me
Adrift in your own sympathy
Can't stand falling apart, don't stay too long in the dark
Alone deep in the dark of your devotion
Let go the love that he stole, let go y'got to let go
To get back in control of your emotion
You can make it through tomorrow
Set free your butterfly girl
And when you rise above the sorrow
You'll be a butterfly girl
Now you're drunk in the dream of your life as dirt
It might last forever, and that really hurts
And I still hope you're gonna realize
There's only one kind of happy in that glass of wine
Can't stand falling apart, don't stay too long in the dark
Alone deep in the dark of your devotion
Let go the love that he stole, let go y'got to let go
To get back in control of your emotion
That's you falling apart, for so long in the dark
So long deep in the heart of your devotion
Let go the love that he stole, let go y'got to let go
To get back in control of your emotion
You can make it through tomorrow
Set free your butterfly girl
And when you rise above the sorrow
You'll be a butterfly girl
You can fly, yeah, yeah
Set free your butterfly girl
You'll go high, yeah, yeah
You'll be a butterfly girl
Set free your butterfly girl
Set free your butterfly girl




 There must be somebody
Who'll make love to me
Blow the rules away
Trash these yesterdays
Live in sympathy
Use psychology
To find the twist in me
Can you deal with it?
A recent enquiry
Showed no boundary
Love's the only way
Can you handle it?

Can you deal with it?

Can you deal with it?
(when you ain't sorry
Can you deal with it?
(for all that you apologize
Working up to something
I know you're up to something




 So soon
Just after you've gone
My senses sharpen
But it always takes
So damned long
Before I feel how much
My eyes have darkened

Fear hangs a plane of gun smoke
Drifting in our room
So easy to disturb
With a thought
With a whisper
With a careless memory

On the table
Signs of love life scattered
And the walls break
We go crashing within
It's not as though
As though you really mattered
But being close
How could I let you go
Without some feeling
Some precious sympathy following


I walk out into the sun
I try to find a new day
But the whole place
It just screams in my eyes
Where are you now?
Cause I don't want to meet you
I think I'd die
I think I'd laugh at you
I think I'd cry
What am I supposed to do
Follow you?

 An hour since the sundown
The ghosts are creeping in
Are gathering around me
Like starlings in the wind
Dark shapes gather round
Voices like my brother's
Are whispering to me
But I don't know these others
Who want to set me free
Come home you're out of time
But the life cannot let go
It's a chain cuts across my soul
Anchoring in this world

I put my hand into the flame
Burning but I feel no pain
Don't speak, don't speak my name
Hold on to this life of chains

The door is standing open
But I'm too tired to be afraid
My whole life's in this moment
I've been fighting all the way
Just need a little more time
Because the life just can't let go
It's a chain cuts across my soul
Anchoring in this world


Chains

 This is where it starts
Standing on the roof up here
Saying goodbye to darkness
Now I can see the big idea
Cities East and West
You won't miss me when I'm gone
The only thing that's left
Is the feeling that I'm moving on
So you walk the line
But something inside you says no way
Are we losing time?
Cuz I waited long enough
I can change the skyline
Out of range but in time
Time to change the skyline
I see far horizons
An empire in a day
Built on hope and burnt by the sun
But I'm happy to watch it fade
When I can raise it up again
You're opening my eyes
Maybe it's not impossible
And don't you think it's time?
Cuz I waited long enough
I can change the skyline
Out of range but in time
Time to change the skyline
I see far horizons
I can change the skyline
Out of range but in time
Time to change the skyline
I see far horizons




 Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you
(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces)
Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into cry

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune i swear i've heard before
Chills, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
(Can not forgive from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into cry

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need, who do you love?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)

 I shed my skin
When the party was about to begin
I'm light years away but I'm walking back tonight
Of all nights
When I should be feeling just right
Don't want to be in public
My head is full of chopstick
I don't like it

Something on my mind
Breaking open doors I had sealed up before
Something on my mind
Makes me run when I thought I'd run too far

Somebody shaking my tree
Maybe that somebody is me
I'm standing in the light but
I'm making a break for the shadows
On the cinema wall
They should be mine but I'm not that tall
Now I'm saying this in private
If I had a car I'd drive it
Insane


I'm looking for cracks in the pavement




 Before you slip into unconsciousness
I'd like to have another kiss
Another flashing chance at bliss
Another kiss, another kiss
The days are bright and filled with pain
Enclose me in your gentle rain
The time you ran was too insane
We'll meet again, we'll meet again
So tell me where your freedom lies
The streets are fields that never die
Deliver me from reasons why
You'd rather cry, I'd rather fly
The crystal ship is being filled
A thousand girls, a thousand thrills
A million ways to spend your time
When we get back, I'll drop a line




 Coming over ya
Danceophobia
Coming over ya

Get on the floor, what you gonna do?
I'm in the system, I'm trying to get to you
We've both waited for so long
Nothing can stop us, come on this is our song

Look around (look around)
And forget the crowd (forget the crowd)
Take my hand (take my hand)
Sing it loud

I know what it is coming over you (coming over you)
You don't dance, danceophobia (danceophobia)
I know what it is coming over you
You don't dance, dance enough
You don't dance


You're in the car, we go and turn
Turn up the volume; am I getting through to you?
Open the window, see what you got
I'm on the speakers, it's time to hit the...

Look around (look around)
And forget the crowd (forget the crowd)
Take my hand (take my hand)
Sing it loud

I know what it is coming over you (coming over you)
You don't dance, danceophobia (danceophobia)
I know what it is coming over you
You don't dance, dance enough
You don't dance
I know what it is coming over you (coming over you)
You don't dance, danceophobia (danceophobia)
I know what it is coming over you
You don't dance, dance enough
You don't dance

Can you hear me?
If you can hear me let me know
I am your doctor
You may be experiencing feelings of confusion
Don't be afraid, I've seen these symptoms before
10-20 new cases each week
We call this condition, danceophobia
I'm going to bring you in for observation
I'll have to work on you throughout the night
We have to trust each other
And together, I think we can beat this thing
Before the music ends

I know what it is coming over you (coming over you)
You don't dance, danceophobia (danceophobia)
I know what it is coming over you
You don't dance, dance enough
You don't dance
I know what it is coming over you (coming over you)
You don't dance, danceophobia (danceophobia)
I know what it is coming over you
You don't dance, dance enough
You don't dance

 (Bowie)
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inchy stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning beast you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knees
I'm sure you're not protected
For its plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will
Mannequins with kill-appeal
Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch a death in the fog
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs
Now halloween jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below
Oh tarzie go man, go
Meets his little hussy with his ghost-town approach
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed
Diamond Dogs are sable-ized
Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone
(chorus)
In the year of the scavenger The season of the bitch
Sashay on the board-walk scurry to the ditch
Just another future song lonely little kitch
There's gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow
Will they come?
I keep a friend serene
Will they come?
Oh, baby, come unto me
Will they come?
Well, she's come, been, and gone
(chorus)




 There's a dirty great monster
In this house
We pretend that it's not there
And there's no escape
From It's grip
But nobody seems to care
Do you ever wonder
About the days
When we were straight
But daddy got the hunger
So much to hide
We learn to lie
So watch yourself
In the hall
Where you're not supposed to know
Cause we're all afraid of each other
We're the victim's in this show
Well Do you ever wonder
About the days
When we were straight
When daddy got the hunger
Too much to hide
We learn to lie
Silently out numbered
We made mistakes
When we were straight
Now we're all going under
Oh oh
So with a sigh we say good bye




 Deliver us from evil
We go with the flow
But here's a little secret
I think you ought to know
Providers and abusers
They know where to go
With Sunday refugees from Sunday TV shows

Downtown all of the way down
Downtown all of the way downtown

Let's sink imagination
Past your wildest wild
(all of the way downtown
Go way below below below
Is it such a crime?
The uptown can't teach you how to live
They don't have the time
Coz where i'm going to take you
Is a state of mine


You better learn to use your heart
You got to loose your money
You better use it all up
Coz you can't take it with you
When you're going down
You'll never come home babe
You'll never come home baby
And you'll never be alone




 Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in shame?
And if love can conquer all
Then why do we only feel the pain?
I heard you speak my name
Heard you singing The Stones
Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static
On my telephone
So why your eyelids are closed
Inside a case of rust
And did you have to change
All your poets fire into frozen dust
I've tried to justify it to learn from your mistake
But where's the stupid lie that has to make it's point
With such a pointless waste
Come out
Do you believe in shame?
Do you believe in love?
And if they taste the same
Would you love again or abandon both?
I don't think I ever can
Belive my friend has gone
Keep saying it's alright I'm going to bring you back
But I know I'm wrong
There's nothing I can say
There's nothing left to do
It's just that lately I feel so damn lonely
When I think of you
And it may seem selfish now
But I'll hold on to the memory
Until all this fear is washed away
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in life?
'Cos I believe a little part of you inside of me
Will never die...




 It was the hottest day in July
And all along Santa Monica Blvd
Cars were stood still
And a gleaming metal tube
Would stretch all the way from Highland
Back to La Brea
And she met under Los Angeles sunshine
Young man was sitting at the wheel
On his way to make a pickup
Turned off the air-con
Rolled down the window
And began to sweat
Out over the Hollywood hills
He saw the clouds building
Like great dark towers of rain
Ready to come tumbling down
Any day now
Not a day too soon
(any day now)
And as the music drifted in
From other cars
His eyes started to sleep
This is the story of his dream

Silver
(Sing Blue Silver, Sing Sing Blue Silver)

This is the story of his dream




 He's sinking faster than a drowning man
He'll grab a hold of anyone he can
Gun in his pocket and a heart of ham
Uncle Sam
He's dying faster than a rabid dog
Infect us all now he's losing blood
Nose for trouble and a soul of rock
Smokey's man

Don't drag me down
I don't wanna drown
You're going down
Na nana na nana nana na na

There's not much flesh
Just skin and bone
Cheeks sunk deep
Eyes popping wide
Don't put out a hand to help him
This drowning man will bite it right off
Right off
Right off
Right off


He's selling faster than a magazine
Infect us all with his TV screen 




 Take me every morning
Take me every night
Take me when you're feeling low
Take me when you want to stay
Up all night

Before you slip into the white
There's something i want you to know
In all your stretch of consciousness
You've still got a long way to go
Some make you spin
Some make you sweat
It's only here for you to choose
Some like it hot
But i like it wet, so tell me
What have we got to lose now?

Take me every morning
Take me every night
Take me when you're feeling low
Take me when you want to stay
Up all night

(A hit, a hit)
A hit to fit reality
It's just a state of mind
And you, and it, it's more than just
And that's what you've got to find
We'll make you spin
We'll make you sweat
All you have to do is choose me
And if you would try
And alternative high
Then tell me, what have we got to lose now?




 Take me every morning
Take me every night
Take me when you're feeling low
Take me when you want to stay
Up all night




 I knew when I first saw you on the showroom floor
You were made for me
I took you home and dressed you up in polyester
Princess of my dreams
Emotionless and cold as ice
All of the things I like
The way you look
The way you move
The sound you're making
In ultra-chrome, latex and steel

I plug you in
Dim the lights
Electric Barbarella
Your perfect skin
Plastic kiss
Electric Barbarella
Try to resist
Then we touch
Hallucinate and tranquilize

She's so fine
She's all mine

Our private life is subject to investigation
No time to waste
People say they heard about our deviation
But you never looked so good
Wear the fake fur and fake pearls for me
And put on your mystery
The way I feel you know
I'll never keep you waiting
In ultra-chrome, latex and steel


Princess of my dreams
Princess of my dreams
Major domo plasticomo Barbarella
(She's so fine)
Pro-genetic you Electric Barbarella
(She's all mine)
My pretty pretty pretty pretty Barbarella




 A little rain of comfort
In the after-noon
To bottling up the room
To lighten up your mood
The whole world is a mix spot
On a plastic spoon
You can find it, or invite it
Live beside it, laugh until you're crying

Hold on to your time, boy
Don't be scared of what they say
You're putting a fight, girl
If you got the face for today, yeah!

Around, around the wall of death
Around you go
What keeps you in the air
Is having not they care, yeah
And time flies like a dancing man
On crystal glow
You can find it, or invite it
Live beside it, laugh until you're crying

Hold on to your time, boy
Don't be scared of what they say
You're putting a fight, girl
You've got that things which makes them smile, yeah
Hold on to your time, boy
Wake up on that speeding train
You're putting a fight, girl
If you got the face for today, yeah!

When you got the face for today, yeah
Hold on to your time, boy
Don't be scared of what they say
You're putting a fight, girl
You've got that things which makes them smile, yeah
Hold on to your time, boy
Wake up on that speeding train
You're putting a fight, girl
If you got the face for today, yeah!
The face for today, yeah
The face for today, yeah

 From this cloud where I hang dangle in the blue
I spy you all tiny creatures on the ground below
For my being reckless got me strung up in the sky
But love is flawed now see the lowlies cry
Cut my cord now better then better off to die

Here am I your falling angel dangle in the blue
I'm your angel and I wish that I could be like you

It's my time all I have for my crime is such
Knowing that the thing I love is that which I can't touch
So I watch your fragile beauty changing in the sun
Love is flawed now see the lowlies cry
Cut my cord now better then better off to die


I believe in you I don't believe it all but I believe in you
I don't believe it all but I belive in you
I don't believe it all but I believe in you
I don't believe it all




 (Duran Duran)
From this cloud where I hang, dangled in the blue
I spy you all tiny creatures on the ground below
For my being reckless got me strung up in the sky
Love is flawed now, see the lawless cry
Cut my cord now, better then, better off to die
Here am I, your falling angel, dangled in the blue
I'm your angel, and I wish that I could be like you
It's my time, all I have for my crime is such
Knowing that the thing I love is that which I can't touch
So I watch your fragile beauty changing in the sun
Love is flawed now, see the lawless cry
Cut my cord now, better then, better off to die
But here am I, your falling angel, dangled in the blue
I'm your angel, how I wish that I could be with
Falling angel, dangled in the blue
I'm your angel, and I wish that I could be like you
I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you, I dont believe it all
But I believe in you




 Once was a man who consumed his place and time
He thought nothing could touch him
But here and now it's a different storyline
Like the straw he is clutching
Why has the sky turned grey
Hard to my face and cold on my shoulder
And why has my life gone astray
Scarred by disgrace, I know that its over

Because I'm falling down
With people standing round
But before I hit the ground
Is there time
Could I find someone out there to help me?

Howl at the wind rushing past my lonely head
Caught inside its own motion
How I wish it was somebody else instead
Howling at all this corrosion
Why did the luck run dry
Laugh in my face, so pleased to desert me
Why do the cruel barbs fly?
Now when disgrace can no longer hurt me

 Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there, where things are hollow
Fame...
Fame, hurts your brain, just a flame
A funny tin to dip you inside
Fame...
Fame, what you like is in the Limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame...
Fame, the dirty swine, it's just his line
He's only trying to drive you to crime... (crime)
Fame...
Is it any wonder
I'll reject you first
Is it any wonder
You're too cool to prove
Fame
A ticket for you, a ticket for me
I've gotta get to Witchitta
Fame...
Fame (Rpt x23)
What's your name?
What a game...
What a shame... What a shame...




 Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Why I see your face
Moving in the aerospace
White Light shining, we're all alone
Scare of flying, cos here we come
White light, homing in
The speed of light, moving in
Faster than light (the light)
Faster than light (the light)
Faster than light...
Faster than light (the light)
Faster than light (the light)
Faster than light...
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You see ways by the door
Pulling over years before
White light shining bright, you're all alone
Scare of flying, cos here we come
White light, homing in
The speed of light, moving in
Faster than light (the light)

 Here she comes you better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
Its true it's not hard to realize
Just look into her false coloured eyes
She'll build you up just to put you down
What a clown

'Cause everybody knows... She's a femme fatale
Things she does to please, sees just a little tease
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks

You're written in her book
You're number 37 take a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy she's from the street
Before you start your're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
Yes it's true

'Cause everybody knows... She's a femme fatale
Things she does to please, sees just a little tease
See the way she walks, hear the way she talks
She will try to put you doen, the hardest girl around

'Cause everybody knows... She's a femme fatale
Things she does to please, sees just a little tease
She's a femme fatale




 How does it feel out on the ice?
You speak to the crowd but nobody hears
It's not a dream and you are no Christ
And you're not alone come in from the fear

Going to take it back
Take back the life that you want to lead
Been under quiet attack
But now it's time for you and me
Going to take it back
You've got to fight for what you believe
We're going to make this stand
The finest hour that we see

When did our choice become erased?
Where is the violence in this crowd?
Now that our voice has been replaced
With a silence that screams out loud


Yeah... The finest hour that we see
We're going to make this stand
The Finest Hour that we see
Yeah -eah - eah -eah -eah




 He turns on the animal
It's that time of day
Here comes little Johnny

From the back streets of the UK
He's got the answer
Doesn't go away
Who's gonna treat you right
Who's gonna change the world tonight...tonight

The lasting first impression
Is what you're looking for
I said oh, is that your first impression
And is that good enough for you?

Don't want illusion
A power glory ride
Doesn't run with the neighborhood shadows
On a death trip body slide
He won't give up
And he won't give in
And he won't let up until
He gets inside your pretty skin




The possibility he sees the possibility
To seize the opportunity he sees the possibility
To turn on the animal

 Friends of mine they said they were friends of mine
Said they were passing time more like a waste of time
Close the door I said close the door I've told you twice before what are you waiting for

Georgie Davis is coming out no more heroes we twist and shout
Oh no not me I'm not too late and I know that I'm not taking anymore
Rocky picture has lost his gun leave him out now he's having fun
Oh not not me I'm not too late and I know that I'm not waiting anymore hey hey

Silly lies don't have to advertise when will you realize I'm sick of your alibis
Running cold the water's running cold it's time that you were told

I see you smile pictures on the wall there all friends of mine
See you standing round the back friends of mine think yourself lucky
Friends of mine they said they were friends of mine
They were just wasting time out on the dotted line
Money's gone I've known it all along why don't you say i'm wrong
Why don't they drop the bomb

 I came by invitation to general Chelsea mayhem
Then going on to somewhere
Yes, I was going somewhere
A single random meeting with your eyes and I am beaten
And now I'm going nowhere
I know I'm going nowhere

With all the voices in my head
The clever words I never said
Of all the things to happen

In a girl panic
That's driving naked through my mind
It's a crush panic
She's got me atomized
You beg me to get closer
Dress falling off your shoulder
Then heat is wrapping round us
This city strapped around us
Cause now I sense your mission is my coming demolition
And you just hold me under
I know I'm going under


In a girl panic
The midnight traffic in her eyes
Like a Hypnotic, and I am mesmerized
You know, you know I want you
I know you know I want you


In a girl panic
A crush panic
She's a Hypnotic
It's a girl panic




 Sound of Camera shutters flickering

See them walking hand in hand across the bridge at midnight
Heads turning as the lights flashing out it's so bright
Then walk right out to the four-line track
There's a camera rolling on her back, on her back
And I sense the rhythm humming in a frenzy all the way down her spine

Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film
Girls on film

Lipstick cherry all over the lens as she's falling
In miles of sharp blue water coming in where she lies
The diving man's coming up for air
Cause the crowd all love pulling dolly by the hair, by the hair
And she wonders how she ever got here as she goes under again

Wider baby smiling you just made a million
Fuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wire

And miles of sharp blue water coming in where she lies
The diving man's coming up for air
'Cause the crowd all love pulling Dolly by the hair
By the hair
And she wonders how she ever got here
As she goes under again
Girls on film (Two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (Got your picture)
Girls on film
Wider, baby, smiling, you've just made a million
Fuses pumping live heat twisting out on a wire
Take one last glimpse into the night
I'm touching close, I'm holding bright
Holding tight
Give me shudders in a whisper
Take me up 'til I'm shooting a star
Girls on film (She's more than a lady)
Girls on film
Girls on film (Two minutes later)
Girls on film
Girls on film (See you together)
Girls on film
Girls on film (See you later)

 (I was hallucinating, I was hallucinating)

I was hallucinating Elvis
Hawaii to Las Vegas
Special treatment all the way
Hallucinating Elvis
Missing 18 hours
Losing oxygen to the brain
Lying on the floor
There's a limit how much more I can take
Rhinestone inside my shoe
Because I'm turning into you

I was hallucinating
I was hallucinating
I was hallucinating, Elvis

FBI tapping the King's phone
74, he's trapped in his home
Hidden cameras, 2-way mirror walls
Walkie-talkie, kung-fu
Then the president calls
I was hallucinating Elvis
Hawaii to Las Vegas
Special treatment all the way
Hallucinating Elvis
Missing 18 hours
Losing oxygen to the brain
Whoever has to know
Tune in to my show
What you see ain't what you get
I'm shooting movies and the TV set
Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, Elvis
I was hallucinating Elvis
Hawaii to Las Vegas
Special treatment all the way
Hallucinating Elvis
Missing 18 hours
Losing oxygen to the brain


Hallucinating




 Hold back the rain
Yes we're miles away from nowhere
And the wind doesn't have a name
So call it what you want to call it
Still blows down the lane
People tell me I haven't changed at all
But I don't feel the same
And I've bet you've had that feeling too
You can't laugh all the time

And if the fires burn out there's only fire to blame
(hold back the rain)
No time for worry cause we're on the roam again
(hold back the rain)
The clouds all scatter and we ride the outside lane
(hold back the rain)
Not on your own so help me please hold back the rain

So what if the words ain't rhyming
Did you thing that it's just a game
I probably didn't even say that right
And I really don't give a damn
Okay go off and wander
I'm guilty just the same
Sometimes you're needed badly
So please come back again


Hold back the rain, hold back the rain. hold back the rain
Hold back the rain (hold back the rain), hold back the rain

 Yeah, this time
Shall we walk?
Shall we run through my head, you understand?
Does the body you conceal
Need the touch of someone's hand?
Ashes; violations
Who would they burn for?
In your isolation what can't you see?

I wonder if the light's down
I wonder if they're listening

Hold me. Lay your shame away
Show me where your lovers stay
Hold me. Lay your ghost away
Show me for yourself

You are lost and alone
But a prisoner of your pride
When the passions you ignore
You can never hide
One of these days you're gonna find out
Cause one of these days you're gonna try
And what did i say
To make you wind up
With this spear of guilt inside



Na na na na na na na. Hold me
Na na na na na na. Show me
No na na na na na na na na na




 (We will continue...er...to...er...watch
This situation very closely
Here in the shadows where we stand
Watching lady, watching man
(And it may take nature three years the experts
Say to make up for the damage done
Greedy for pictures as they roll
We see the planet lose control

About $750 of revolving debt

(Ah it's a good sign
About time, time will change the picture

Power to change the point of view
But what is fake and what is true

Is torching homes and killing Americans
Blow by blow you're telling me
You'll change the course of history

I turn you on you turn me off
Right now I'm suffering from this culture shock
Spread confusion wherever you can
With shaking heads and shaking hands
Cue propoganda to manipulate
Where there's megabucks you protect the state
Let the body break and the body tumble
So you build it up, then you watch it crumble




 Dark in the city night is a wire
Steam in the subway earth is afire
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Woman you want me give me a sign
And catch my breathing even closer behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Smell like I sound I'm lost in a crowd
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Straddle the line in discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
High blood Drumming on your skin it's so tight
You feel my heat I'm just a moment behind
Do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

In touch with the ground
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Scent and a sound. I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I howl and I whine I'm after you
Mouth is alive all running inside
And I'm hungry like the wolf

Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf
Hungry like the wolf

Burning the ground I break from the crowd
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
I smell like I sound. I'm lost and I'm found
And I'm hungry like the wolf
Strut on a line it's discord and rhyme
I'm on the hunt down I'm after you
Mouth is alive with juices like wine

 The taxman's in the pocketbook
The pressmen are by the bar
And all the world is at your door
It's strange that you should lock it up
And preach an open heart
But you know what they're waiting for
You can turn your face away now
And don't think twice
I'm just the ordinary guy you used to know
I'm not after your money
Or even your advice
I believe you'll follow me
It's all I need to know
(to walk away)
-
I was tempted by the devil in this deep blue swimming pool
Until the devils makeup ran..
And my future's in the strangle hold of ever changing rules
I don't intend to understand
You can stop pretending now that I had you fooled
I'm still the ordinary guy you used to know
I'm not after your money
To paralyze my soul
I believe you'll follow me
It's all I need to know
Promise me you'll try to understand before I go
(and walk away)

All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know
All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know
All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know
All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know
All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know
All I need to, all I need to, all I need to know

 I shed my skin
When the party was about to begin
I'm light years away but I'm walking back tonight
Of all nights
When I should be feeling just right
Don't want to be in public
My head is full of chopstick
I don't like it
Something on my mind
Breaking open doors I had sealed up before
Something on my mind
Makes me run when I thought I'd run too far
Somebody shaking my tree
Maybe that somebody is me
I'm standing in the light but
I'm making a break for the shadows
On the cinema wall
They should be mine but I'm not that tall
Now I'm saying this in privaate
If I had a car I'd drive it
Insane
Something on my mind
Breaking open doors I had sealed up before
Something on my mind
Makes me run when I thought I'd run too far
I'm looking for cracks in the pavement




 Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you right in the head
You better get yourself together
Pretty soon your gonna be dead
What in the world you thinking of?
Laughing in the face of love
What on Earth you try'na do?
It's up to you
Yeah, you
Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna hit you right in the face
You better get yourself together darling
Join the human race
How in the world you gonna see?
Laughing at fools like me
Who on Earth d'you think you are?
A superstar?
Well, right you are
And we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well, we all shine on
Everyone, c'mon
Instant Karma's gonna get you
Gonna knock you off your feet
Better recognise your brothers
Everyone you meet
Why in the world are we here?
Surely not to live in pain and fear
Why on Earth are you there
When you're everywhere
Gonna get your share
Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
C'mon and on and on, on, on
Yeah, yeah
Alright
Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
On and on and on, on and on
And we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Well, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
Like the moons and the stars and the sun
Yeah, we all shine on
Like the moon and the stars and the sun

 Now the time has come
The music's between us
Though the night seems young
Is at an end
Only change will bring
You out of the darkness
In this moment everything is born again
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Now the fireball burns
We go round together
As the planet turns into the light
Something more than dreams to
Watch out for each other
Coz we know what it means to be alive
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Feel the new day enter your life
Feel the new day
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life

Is There Anyone
Is there anyone out there?
I never found out what made you leave
And now the day's over, just an hour to go
I tried to phone last night, but you never answered
Just left me ringing on the line
Outside
Is there anyone out there?
Anyone else outside?
Oh, outside
Is there anyone out there?
Anyone else outside?
My face in the mirror shows a break in time
A crack in the ocean that does not align
I tried to sleep last night, but I caught you dreaming
About days we used to wonder away
Outside
Is there anyone out there?
Anyone else outside?
Oh, outside

 Please, please tell me now
Please, please tell me now

I made a break, I run out yesterday
Tried to find my mountain hideaway
Maybe next year, maybe no go
I know you're watching me
Every minute of the day, yeah
I've seen the signs
And the looks and the pictures
That give your game away, yeah
There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way?
Do you feel the same, cause you don't let it show?

People stare
And cross the road from me
And jungle drums
They all clear the way for me
Can you read my mind
Can you see in the snow
And fiery demons all dance
When you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me
You're about as easy as a nuclear war
There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

 Midnight I think I'm going to make it
Feel the magical lash of the roll
And the crash in their lives
Headline in tomorrow's papers
Kill that light it's so bright
And you're shining it right in my eyes

Show me your secret and tell me your name
Catch me with your fizzy smile
Try to remember again and again
What it is that I recognize
Don't ask me now
When I need you I don't know how
To believe in your advice
Just this once I take the dice

Midnight so what's the point of faking
For a kiss or a whisper
You pull out a desperate prize
Hold tight onto Daddy's bracelet
Make them pay for their chances
With money they don't think that's nice




 Beat is getting stronger
Feel it getting stronger
Sound is getting longer, too
Music is a thought to me

I want to, I want to
I want to take you higher (take you higher)

Baby, baby, baby, light my fire (light my fire)
I want to take you higher (take you higher) Whoo!

Beat is nitty gritty

Music  is in your city, too
Music's been a thought to me


Higher, higher, higher

Beat is there, I'm with you
Beating there to lose you
Sound is there to help you groove
Music's been a thought to me
Everybody take your places


Boom shaka-laka-laka!

I'm gonna take you higher (take you higher)
I wanna take you higher (take you higher)
Baby, baby, baby, light my fire (light my fire)

Higher, higher, higher, mmm...

 Didn't no one tell you money is a game playing so hard to get now
I don't even know your name

(Khanada I'll get by) Don't play with me I've nothing to lose
(Khanada I'll get by) Ain't no one's day is coming too soon
(Khanada I'll get by) I don't believe in dragons or blue
(Khanada I'll get by) I don't believe in nobody's rules

Heavy as the rain falls I might go outside just because you're with me
Doesn't mean you're not the same




 Here comes the morning light you can't face
Lie on your bed staring into space
Watch the time slip gently by
Don't ask why
So many friends but nobody calls
Can't be alone when the darkness falls
Got to make it to the party
Socialise, break the ice

Oh, Lady Xanax where were you last night?
All the cracks in your make-up are starting to show
Don't think that you realise how far away you go now
Look into the future and don't be afraid...afraid
Of what is on your mind

There, in the emptiness deep inside
You are the one that's been left behind
So you paint with your mascara
Social eyes, don't look twice


Lady Xanax, you're out tonight
Lady Xanax, you're, oh, so tired
Lady Xanax, sleep well tonight

 Baby, i'm really sorry
To break your dream
When it's so early
Headlights
On the windowpane
They're getting lost
In the light of day
Tomorrow is today
And soon my ship will sail

Away from here
To walk a howling sealane
Stay for me
Your love is life
For love is land

Baby, just hear my story
Before i leave
Before we write the end
Standing, across the ocean stream
I'll need to know
I'll need your country then
Tomorrow and today
You keep my landfall safe

Away from here (away from here)
To walk a howling sealane (away from you)
Stay for me (stay for me)
I need your love to land
Away from here (away from here)
To walk a howling sealane (away from you)
Stay for me (stay for me)
Your love is life, for love is land 

Love is land 




 I don't remember quite how I met you wasn't long ago
I just get a picture of sun in your eyes the waves in your hair
Maybe it's something said in a movie or you could've said last night
It just took me out on a limb and I don't really know what I'm doing here

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide and my beats so in time can you look at me
I'm out of reach I'll talk if it feels right I've had my last chance on the stairway
And if you want I'll fall off forever I can't say no more baby dance with me
And please don't say leave it till later I've had my last chance on the stairway

Funny it's just like a scene out of Voltaire twisting out of sight
Cause when all the curtains are pulled back we'll turn and see the circles we've traced
Ain't no game (ooo-ooo) when you're playing with fire
It doesn't seem right that we fight so the party runs all night


Wonder why (wonder why ooo-ooo) what makes me rise so high
Maybe it's something they put in your perfume or the look in your eyes
It could be the atmosphere sinking ooo I don't even know what you're thinking
I don't even know what you're drinking but it keeps this heaven alive


Last chance on the stairway

 Mesmerised
You get sucked in by the hype
Headlights in your eyes
Flame burns fast
Then your soul goes up in smoke
Where's your faith in life?

Now what would you do
If there was no tomorrow?
And where would you go
If you knew this was your last day on Earth?

Having the time of your life
But you don't realise
Play to win
So you got to roll the dice
It's a vicious game
One false move
That's how fortunes change
And you're going down


This is the time of your life
But you don't realise
Now what would you do
If you knew this was your last day on Earth?
I'd kiss you goodbye

Last chance, living, taking, giving, having
Losing, needing, loving, waking, standing
Hoping, dreaming, smiling, laughing, feeling
Crying, wanting something, touching, living:
Your last day on Earth




 Now an unexpected peace comes to the day
As the howling dimmed the fighting dies away
When the hanging dust is clearing from the air
You can just make out a lonely figure there

He's the last man standing on the track
He does not look down
He does not look back
He's the last man standing on the track
You can't hold him down
You can't hold him back

He's sorry for the wrong he has done
And he cries out for the anger for so long
All the cuts and bruises suffered
In whose name
Oh but now is not the time to face his shame




 I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Till the morning fills the sky
No one's getting left behind
This is our time
This is our time!

We're gonna live this night, ye-yeah
Living like it's our last night
Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow

I'm not thinking 'bout the future
(the future)
It's somewhere out there
We're all busy being human
(human)
We remember
Hearts' spinning all around on me
(together)
Now they're surrounding me
This is how we get connected
Running out the shadows into light!

We're gonna live this night, ye-yeah
Living like it's our last night
Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow

We're gonna love this night, ye-yeah
Loving like it's our last night
Stars up in the air, ye-yeah
It's our last night in the city!

I've been traveling around now
Big world with my brothers
Always moving to a new town
No time to put the roots down
We can't stop believing
(can't stop)
Now we believe in you
Cause when you're standing in the spotlights
The only thing that matters is tonight!!

We're gonna live this night, ye-yeah
Living like it's our last night
Cause nobody cares
If there's no tomorrow

We're gonna love this night, ye-yeah
Loving like it's our last night
Stars up in the air, ye-yeah
It's our last night in the city!

Ye-yeah
Last night in the city
Ye-yeah
Last night in the city, city....

I'm not gonna sleep tonight
Till the morning fills the sky
No one's getting left behind
This is our time
This is our time!

We're gonna live this night, ye-yeah
Living like it's our last night

It's our last night in the city!

Ye-yeah
Last night in the city
Ye-yeah
Last night in the city




 There's a hole in the wall next to you
Things with legs are crawling through
The man is searching for the door and you run
You're coming out, you're going down
There's an all night party in room 7609
La-la-la late bar, la la la la la la la la
You can dance together all night, if you've got the time
La-la-la late bar, la la la la la la la la
The bodies move like flies on the wall
You want to run but there's no space at all
The dancers spinning in the mirror ball

 In the half light of the evening
I can almost see you glow
Can tell by the way you're moving
Time may be right to let you know
You got many coloured halo
The body of Venus, a babe rainbow
And if I come any closer I might fall into your silhouette
But the shape of things to come is constantly changing
So let it, so let it, so let it flow

La la la la lava lamp
La la la la lava lamp

Indigo, violet and blue
Can we meet where the edges blur?
Because I am coming at you
Like a bug eye heading for the burn
Truth is I can't stay away
No, I want to let you light my volcano
And maybe it's just in my imagination
But you never know
Because the shape of things to come is constantly changing
So let it, so let it, so let it flow




 Lay lady lay
Lay across my big brass bed

Whatever colors you have in your mind
I show them to you and you see them shine
Chorus]
Lay lady lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay
Stay with your man a while
Until the break of day
Let me see you make him smile

His clothes are dirty but his
His hands are clean
And you are the best thing
That he's ever seen

Stay lady stay
Stay with your man a while

Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it, too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you

Lay lady lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay lady stay
Stay while the night is still ahead

I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night

Stay lady stay
Stay while the night is still ahead
Lay lady lay
Stay 




 So come the evening
I'm out on the dunes
Looking for a token
Something to prove
All I remember
Is more than a flame
In my fantasy fire

Whatever I've done to receive
Whatever I need to redeem
Whatever you say
Even if I wait a lifetime

I know, I swear, if you leave a light on, if you leave a light on
For me
I'll come there
You can leave a light on for me

In comes the morning
I'm stood in my track
Looking at the reasons
For me to head back
So unexpected
The kindness you've shown
That I will not forget it



You breathe the will into the weak
And coax the cage bird to fly free
You ease the lost cause out of me
With your sweet hand to bring me home
I'm not alone




 I'll tell you something
To let you understand the way i feel
Just what you mean to me
Thank you for fine times
We nearly made it all the way but no
It wasn't meant to be
You say we feel the same
There ain't no blame to decide
But if a little time could change your mind
I'll be here

And you can call me
(if you want to stay with me
At your liberty
You can hold me
(if you want to be with me
At your liberty

Do you remember
How lovers ripe on summer's heathen night
Would never seem to end?
And does December (December
Come stirring with that finger of desire (desire
To feel it once again?
You worry 'bout your friends
But if they find what's going on
But a little time could change your mind
I'll be here


Help me out
I live in doubt
Sort me out
Yeah

Don't make it every night
Don't want to be the love of your life
So if you are inclined
To spend a little time
I'll be here


(if you want to stay with me
If you want to be with me
If you want to stay with me
If you want to write to me
At your liberty

 Waiting for you
It's a lonely business
What more can I do
I could be here until Christmas
Why do you want to go saying those sins about me?
Don't you know that a girl can't be made to hurry?
Don't you want me to feel like a million dollars?
I'm just taking some time out to make a difference
Chained, one step over the line
Trying to get something to work
All I need is someone to say
After all
What's the mystery?
When everybody wants to know
About destiny
Just trying to kill a little time
Working hard day to day
Why complain about it
Don't you know that a man can't be mad about it
Woman at the top
Why's the story so familiar
Something's got to drop
For this hombre to remain here
Chained, dream up some while she's trying
Trying to find something to wear
All you need is someone to say
Here we go
What's the mystery?
When everybody wants to know
About destiny
Are you ready for the use of time?
Waiting for you
It's a lonely business
What more can I do
I could be here until Christmas
Chained, one step over the line
Trying to get something to work
All I need is someone to say
After all
What's the mystery?
When everybody wants to know
About destiny
Just trying to kill a little time
What's the mystery?
'cause everybody wants to know
What's their destiny?
Are you ready for the use of time?
What's the mystery?




 Even on the darkest night when empty promise means empty hand
And soldiers coming home like shadows turning red
And when the lights of hope are fading quickly then look to me
I'll be your homing angel I'll be in your head

Because you're lonely in your nightmare let me in
And there's heat beneath your winter let me in

I see the delta traces living lonely out on the limb
And a passing glimmer warm beneath your skin
Please tread gently on the ground when all around you earth turns to fire
Only get a second chance when danger's on the wind


Must be lucky whether when you find the kind of wind that you need
Come on show me all the light and shade that made your name
I know you've got it in your head I've seen that look before
You've built your refuge turns you captive all the same

Because your lonely in your nightmare let me in
And it's barren in your garden let me in
Because there's heat beneath your winter let me in
Because you're so lonely in your nightmare let me in
And it's cold out on the stone range let me in
Because there's heat beneath your winter let me in




 Even on the darkest night when empty promise means empty hand

Please tread gently on the ground when all around you earth turns to fire
Only get a second chance when danger's on the wind
Because you're lonely in your nightmare let me in
Because there's heat beneath your winter let me in
And it's silent on your stone field let me in
Must be lucky weather when you find the kind of wind that you need
Come on show me all the light and shade that made your name
I know you've got it in your head I've seen that look before
You've built your refuge turns you captive all the same

And it's barren in your garden let me in

And you're lonely in your nightmare let me in
Because you've waited through your ice age let me in
Because you're so lonely in your nightmare let me in
And it's cold out on the stone range let me in
Because there's heat beneath your winter let me in




 When I first met you on the roof
You caught me in your web of youth
But now I know the wicked truth
It's much too late so what's the use in fighting?
You peel me like an onion skin
And wonder at the state I'm in
One day you'll turn up to begin
And find there's nothing left but innuendo
Beside you others fade away
Like amateurs in love's charade
Much more than just a game you play
These certain rules become a way of living

Night after night I try to prove
That I can resist you
Tied up inside your love voodoo
Designed to manipulate

The queen of sensuality
You shelter me from liberty
It's nothing short of piracy
That's not to say it doesn't please me sometimes
Now this may come as no surprise
But I'm content to compromise
Until the day you realize
That i have been manipulating you


Yes, I'm tied up inside your loving
But it's voodoo to me
Every night how I try
How I try to resist you
But it's no good to me




 (steve harley)
You've done it all, you've broken every code
And pulled the rebel to the floor
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say
For only metal-what a bore!
Blue eyes, blue eyes, how come you tell so many lies?
Come up and see me, make me smile
Or do what you want, run on wild
There's nothing left, all gone and run away
Maybe you'll tarry for a while
It's just a test, a game for us to play
Win or lose, it's hard to smile
Resist, resist, it's from yourself you have to hide
(chorus)
There ain't no more, you've taken everthing
From my belief in mother earth
How can you ignore my faith in everything
When I know what faith is and what it's worth
Away, away, and don't say maybe you'll try




 You've done it all, you've broken every code
And pulled the rebel to the floor
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say
For only metal - what a bore!
Blue eyes, blue eyes; how can you tell so many lies?
Come up and see me, make me smile
Or do what you want, runnin' wild
There's nothing left, all gone and run away
Maybe you'll tarry for a while
It's just a test, a game for us to play
Win or lose, it's hard to smile
Resist, resist; it's from yourself you have to hide
Come up and see me, make me smile
Or do what you want, runnin' wild
There ain't no more, you've taken everything
From my belief in Mother Earth
How can you ignore my faith in everything
Cause' I know what faith is, what it's worth
Away, away, and don't say maybe you'll try
Come up and see me, make me smile
Or do what you want, runnin' wild
Ohhhhhhhhh la la la
Ohhhhhhhhh la la la ohhhhhh
Come up and see me, make me smile
Or do what you want, runnin' wild
Ohhhhhhhhh la la la
Ohhhhhhhhh la la la ohhhhhh
Come up and see me, make me smile

Here's looking at you




 Oh, Medazzaland

I have a problem, they said they can solve
Soon I won't speak
I have no words left in me
I dream in pictures
But the sound is muted
I have no way to understand what they say
Into Medazzaland
People are starting to talk
But I don't hear them anymore
Now I can't see
But I am still able to think
Do I have any feeling left?
What are they saying about me?
Do they really understand what's wrong?
I feel their hands on my skin
The time has come for them to begin
I'm sinking deeper and deeper
Into Medazzaland
I can feel the scalpel on my skin
It's cutting in
Deeper and deeper
I'm in Medazzaland
Oh, Medazzaland




 Across the sky
A jet trail following
The wish that I was on the plane
On my way to some out destination
Undiscovered never mentioned
Sipping on the high of expectation
I awaken to the shade

Maybe it's the rain of town
One you wanted to leave behind
When the winter's on the ground
If you ever wonder

We believe in the cold grey lights we dream
There's a place for us
Mediterranea
Yes we believe where the white sands touch the sea
There's space for us
Mediterranea

I'm trading in for touch down ecstasy
Arriving there in a wave of heat
Lying in the beach tequila mayhem
Summer of all suburbian daydreams
Waiting for a look the invitation
I awaken to the shade



I imagine
Summer fashion, see yourself in another town
Let the sunshine out of your mind
A bed of light to lay you down


And we believe
Yes we believe
There's a place for us
Mediterranea




 Miss november tuesday
Bend your rubber rules
Take your time, but don't take
Off your high heeled shoes
She's in demand at dinner time;
She's on the factory wall
And when the gentlemen retire
Guess who's in control?
She blew your money
On taking a cruise
If that isn't funny
Well, watch out teacher

Ooh, ooh. When the chamber's empty
She said ooh, ooh, meet el presidente

Dressed in flimsy clothing
Use your lipstick line
To colour fear and loathing
With a pink disguise
You've never refused when she lies back
Put a stripe on the union; and a star on the jack
She's on the case at dinner time
She's on the evening news
And if you dare step out of line
You're going to be abused
You may not like it
You may not be scared
But hell has no fury like a
Young girl's ego


Ooh, ooh. Doo, doo, doo
You might adopt an attitude;
Look on the moral side
But if police are after you
Where's the best place to hide?
For this production
They gave her a gun
Ain't no director
So watch out actors!




 Yeah, mm
Yeah
Yeah (yeah) mm

 I came over your place today
In a roundabout sort of way
Nothing holding me
Just the company
Gentle giving the afternoon

Don't ever try to be any more
Michael, you've got a lot to answer for
You unlocked some of the doors to my soul

And I don't see you for a while
Thinkin of you will make me smile
You never bother me with responsibility
Misbehaving in candlelight

Don't ever try to give any more
Michael, you've got a lot to answer for
You got me waking up wise to the world

Trust you to get caught up in somebody's war
You'll come out of it all in time, I'm sure
Just remember what friends were put here for
Michael, you've got a lot to answer for

And I know that you're going to call
If you need me
When you need me
If you need me




 As I watch you flickering slowly
In the shadows, nothing to hold
It's as if I don't recall our time before
And would it be so wrong
Not to remember?
There are times I look at you differently
Like I'd never seen you before
Funny after all we've done
You could be someone I don't know at all
Don't know you at all
Catch me I don't want to fall
But you pull the mountain from under me
Look, I'm dangling up in the blue
And it's a cartoon coyote eternity
Before I drop down to you
What am I supposed to do now?
There is something beautiful shining
In the far-off night of your hair
Funny for a while it seemed to come from the sky
But it's in your head
Yes, it fills your head

You and I don't always fly
Let me go I want to fall
Deep into the dark
But I'll get back to you
And I'll always know how to find you
Because you shine like the midnight sun

Yes, I'll always be here beside you
When I follow the midnight sun
Follow follow follow the midnight sun




 Once I thought that I was in control
But that was just another trick of fate
Playing with my life
There have been some times
I was so tied up
And I said to myself
Gotta break it all
But didn't really try

Two hearts beating in this place you've made
You know nothing changes my Antarctica

You can make your rhymes
And paint your rules
In black and white
For me to memorize
But never understand
And there will be time
For a thousand vows
Oh a thousand promises
We forgot
To be realized


We'll keep the rhythm going
And we'll remember
We'll keep the laughter flowing
And we'll remember
We let the music jangle
And we'll remember


And you
Will stay here
With me




 I saw you at the airace yesterday April showers get out of my way
Fear of flying no not me
I'm never bothered what you say someone's kid just lives for today
It ain't your problem anyway

Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way
Cause I've got my own way, I can find my own way, cause I've got my own way

Number one public figure what a pain just puts another rattle in your brain
Take another green but it's not the same
So now you're on the sandlane everyday dancing with the bulls in any old way
Running like a fox to keep up with me


I'm on 45 between 6th and Broadway, 45 between 6th and Broadway 45
I'm drinking 7UP between 6th and Broadway 7UP between 6th and Broadway, 7UP

 I've caught you knocking on my cellar door
I love you baby can I have some more ooo-ooo the damage done
I hate the city and I lost my band I watch the needle take another man
Gone, gone the damage done
I sing this song because I love the man
I know that some of you don't understand
Built up to keep from running out
I've seen the needle and the damage a little part of it in everyone
But if you junkies like the setting sun




 D-U-R-A-N D-U-R-A-N
You can call me wrong
You can put me straight
Say the very thing
That i love or hate
Another youtube star
You know how its gonna end
Looking for the real world
With my facebook friends
Elegant times
For no conversation
Cos' now we're online
A networker nation
Dada da da dada da da
Dada da da dada da da
Dada da da dada da da
Dada da da dada
We write in the book
Its a piece of cake
We could change the world
If we can stay awake
In this screen-lit room
Halfway in tonight
Would spark the news
Set the story alight
Elegant times
For no conversation
Cos' now we're online
A networker nation
And nobody minds
If its imitation
We're living our life
In a networker nation
Dada da da dada da da

 Shake up the picture the lizard mixture
With your dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers
All of which I deny
I said it again
Could I please rephrase it
Maybe I can catch a ride
I couldn't really put it much plainer
But I'll wait till you decide
Send me your warning siren
As if I could ever hide
Last time La Luna

I light my torch and wave it for the
New moon on Monday
And a firedance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite

Breaking away with the best of both worlds
A smile that you can't disguise
Every minute I keep finding
Clues that you leave behind
Save me from these reminders
As if I'd forget tonight
This time La Luna

(Fire dance through the night...)
(I light my torch and wave it for the...)

I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
Breaking away with the best of both worlds
A smile that you can't disguise
And every minute I keep finding
Clues that you leave behind
Save me from these reminders
As if I'd forget tonight
This time La Luna
I light my torch and wave it for the
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
I light my torch and wave it for the
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
(Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite
(I light my torch and wave it for the)
New moon on Monday
And a fire dance through the night
(Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold day with a lonely satellite




 I've been now sauntering
Out and down the path sometime
Come on, it takes me nowhere, which I knew
Faces everywhere pulling grins and signs in things
Telling me not there, man, it's no go
Don't go there boy
I need a reason
I can't think without one now
Too much learning got to show
Call it treason
Maybe catch her, don't know how
Too many things, too much to know
Bring my timing in, seagulls gather on the wind
Lady screaming, lady leave me out
Cause sometimes people stare
Coming down, electric chair
And steaming crowds they gather and they shout

Don't know why this evil bothers me
Take another chance boy, carry the fight
You can take him if you're fast
So why is he trying to follow me?
Didn't I say if you're holding on
You'd be laughing at the last
How many reasons do they need?
I get along fine with them friends of mine
But you have to make a choice
I might just believe this time
You're singing out of tune but the beat's in time
And it's us who makes the noise

I'm talking for free, I can't stop myself
It's a new religion
I've something to see, I can't help myself
It's a new religion

Okay, my reasoning might be clouded by the sun
But someone sees the departmental lie
You know this peacetime jabbing fist in stabbing knife
Only get one look before you die



Got to take pay the saints 'n sinners
In regulation hats 'n scarves 'n things
Walking in formation down the lane
They carry their cross, make a church bell ring
Army majors pull a mean cool truth
There lying in a swimming pool
Searching for the undeniable truth that
A man is just a fool

 Take the beautiful sting of a Scorpio
A careless smile and it begins to snow
And it hurts me to think
That you might never know
That I've got this thing about you
In case you don't understand
There's something else I meant to tell you

There is nothing better
Than being with you
And I'm feeling so nice
There is nowhere better
Than here with you
And it's feeling so nice

Staying up with the moon
And walking home in the rain
Mixed with your perfume
And never twice the same
I got a lot to lose
But everything to gain
When I really think about it
You haven't got a clue
It's all that I can do to hide it


Did I already say
Because you make me forget
I might as well be brave and tell you
And it hurts me to think that
You might never know
Will it hurt as much being true?
I might as well be brave and tell you
Yeah I'm feeling
And it's feeling so nice

 Standing on the edge of a quay no lights flashing on the water for me
Fog in my mind darkens my eyes silently streaming for a distant sound
Ripple river yellows rising for a breath of breeding and drowns
Stillness overcomes me in the night listen to the rising water moan

I'm waiting, waiting for the night boat woo I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat

Shadows all through me shudder away echo me echo me (echo me
Am I alone or is the river alive cause it echos me, echos me, echos me

 You're nocturnal
Only come out at night
And I'm learning
All the ways you want to ride
Because you're on the roam
But not until the darkness arrives
And I'm certain
I'll catch up to you one of these times, baby
Oh
Can I get my hands on you tonight
(I must be feeling something)
Some thing tells me I'm in for a ride
(I wonder if you see me coming)
Can I put my hands on you tonight
(One night has got me running)
Something tells me I'm in for a ride
(Right into your night time world because I'm a)

Nite Runner
I think I'm falling for you
Nite Runner
You got a style that put me under
Nite Runner
What you going to do with it now
Nite Runner
Nite, nite runner

Light scatters
When you walk into the room
Under shadow
I can feel the heat in you
Should I be surprised
I see the possibility
Moving right across to me
And it all matters
When I'm getting close to you, hey yeah
Uh huh
Can I get my hands on you tonight
(I must be feeling something)
Something tells me I'm in for a ride
(I wonder if you see me coming)
Can I put my hands on you tonight
(One night has got me running)
Something tells me I'm in for a ride
(Right into your night time world because I'm a)


Love is haunting
She wanted to go
That's what she told me
Love is haunting
She wanted to go
But I can't, can't




 I am I, myself alone
Realize I never need to use no one
When it comes down to my soul
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
There was a time I was so afraid
Of everything people around me said
That I wanted to hide my face in the shadows
There was a time on a bed of nails
I was dreaming a plan up that could not fail
But no power under the sun could pull it together

Can't take this attitude
Got to show now i've got to move on
God knows where I'm going to
Its a lonely burning question

I am I myself alone
Realize i never need to use no-one
Money, power, holy roads
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above
If there's a time that we ever see
The nature of life in reality
Then I want to be there
To kick at the answer


I am I myself alone
Realize I never need to use no-one
When it comes down to my soul
Freedom puts my faith in none of the above

Freedom puts my faith in none of the above 

None of the above
My faith in none of the above
None of the above
I stand by none of the above
None of the above
I stand by none of the above




 I'm I myself alone
Realise I never need to use no one

Whoa
If there's a time that we ever see
The nature of life in reality
Then I want to be there
To kick at the answer
I can't take this attitude
Got to show now I've got to move on

 Looking up from the polar sheet
Out in the stars there's one I want to meet
I am a signal somewhere in your bliss
So do you hear, do you hear my wish?
You coming down now... from there?
You coming round now... to share?
You got a thing that...
I care, I care about, I care about
If you want to stay tonight
Write your name across the sky
Nothing I would rather like
Than see you in the Northern lights
Up on the roof I listen for the moan
Of your soft footstep on the snow
Now and then somebody else's glow
As they tune in to watch the show
You coming down now... from there?
You coming round now... to share?
You got a thing that...
I care, I care about, I care about
If you want to stay tonight
Write your name across the sky
Nothing I would rather like
Than see you in the Northern lights
If you want to play the night
We could take an evening flight
Shine out from a higher height
Then we'll be in the Northern lights
If you want to stay tonight
Write your name across the sky
Nothing I would rather like
Than see you in the Northern lights
If you want to play the night
We could take an evening flight
Shine out from a higher height
Then we'll be in the Northern lights
Write your name across the sky
Write your, write your name
Write your name across the sky




 No-no-notorious
No-no-notorious
I can't read about it
Burns the skin from your eyes
I'll do fine without it
Here's one you don't compromise
Lies come hard to disguise
Let me to fight it out, not wild about it
Lay your seedy judgments
Who says they're part of our lives?

You own the money
You control the witness
I hear you're lonely
Don't monkey with the business
You pay the profits to justify your reasons
I heard your promise but I don't believe it
That's why I'll do it again
No-no-notorious
Girls will keep the secrets
So long as boys make the noise
Fools run rings to break up
Something they'll never destroy
Grand notorious slam (bam!)
And who really gives a damn for a flaky bandit?
Don't ask me to bleed about it
I need this blood to survive

Notorious
Notorious
Notorious

(No-no-no) That's why I'll do it again
(No-notorious) Yeah, that's why I'll do it again
(No-no-notorious) Yeah, that's why I'll do it again
(No-notorious, no-no-notorious)
Yeah, that's why I'll do it again
(No-notorious, no-no-notorious)




 Why did you let me run
When you knew I'd fall for the gaping hole
Where your heart should be
Liar-couldn't cut me deeper with a knife if you tried
Just take a look (before you run off and hide)
At your victim
Arise
Clouds on you shoulder
Aren't they grazed by the afterglow
How quiet they gather
When the storm is about to blow

No don't look away
Caught in the crossfire
And it ain't no wind of change
I'm talking of crime and passion's rage

Summer of madness or the undertow
Dragged me up an alley for the blossoming fire
On a stranger's smile
Bride of wire-how disguise so easily cracked
Saw your heart turn spade
This orchid's turned to black
Graze on your shoulder
Like the clouds in the afterglow
How quiet they gather
When the storm is about to blow


Way down by the shoulder
In the haze of the afterglow
Stranded together
And the storm is about to blow




 Suddenly it all looks so familiar
Gone and wrecked it like I always do
Don't you know it?
Life is out to kill you
But you still go getting on with it

Seen better times than right now
But I'm not running away
No nothing's going to bring me down

It's just been one of those days
I'm not the only one
They can drag me to the gates of hell now
There's nothing left but I'm still hanging in
Not for me, ain't no final showdown
I'm too shattered to do anything


It's just been one of those days
I'm not the only one feeling this way
And I'm not sorry
I'm not the only one feeling this way
And I'm not sorry
Not running away




 Only in dreams girl am I part of your world
My heart it screams or so it seems
Only in dreams
Only in my - in my dreams - only in my dreams
Only in my - in my dreams - only in my dreams
Only in dreams girl where my crime goes unheard
What does it mean to fly the scene?
Only in dreams girl
There's a vampire in the limousine
Sun's going down like a symphony
She keeps a guard up while her nails are wet
I don't want to wake up
Only in dreams I'm in dopamine time
It's in my genes, it get's extreme
Only in dreams
How did I dream you?
You're the queen of steel dunes
Look what you've done - my colors run
When ever you come to
There's a vampire in the limousine
Sun's going down like a symphony
She keeps a guard up while her nails are wet
I don't want to wake up
Only in my - in my dreams - only in my dreams
There's a vampire in the limousine
Sun's going down like a symphony
She keeps a guard up while her nails are wet
I don't want to wake up
On the rooftop we can feel the drop
She bathes in the moon while the shadows watch
I should be nervous but my eyes forget
I don't want to wake up
I'm not gonna wake up
I don't want to wake up
Only in my - in my dreams - only in my dreams
Don't want to wake up
Only in my - in my dreams - only in my dreams
Don't want to wake up
... dreams




 Came in from a rainy Thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Here today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every one
Is my world, I will learn to survive
Any one
Is my world, I will learn to survive
Any one
Is my world
Every one
Is my world

 Selling exes down the river
Every Katie's got her price
And the details make you shiver
But it's hard to escape when your head is stuck in vice
Because nothing matters in the self obsessive age
Where they dare you not to notice
But it's everywhere in shocking colour on the page
In the magazine
Staring out at me
Out of my TV
Other people's lives
Pixelated lives
Just like yours and mine
Every weekend i bear witness
To the social suicides
To the thief who stays for breakfast
To the poster child screwing everybody's wife
Yeah it's just a story
But it keeps me hanging on
For the needy soul
The glory hole confessional
I got to see what's going down
In the magazine
Staring out at me




 Light a candle
Lay flowers at the door
For those who were left behind
And the ones who've gone before
But here it comes now
Sure as silence follows rain
The taste of you upon my lips
The fingers in my brain
Ever gentle as it kills me where I lay
Who am I to resist?
Who are you to fail?

Got to get you out of my mind
But I can't escape from the feeling
As I try to leave the memory behind
Without you, what's left to believe in?

And I could be so sorry
For the way it had to go
But now I feel your presence
In a way I could not know
And I wonder
Do you ever feel the same
In whispering darkness
Do you ever hear my name?


How could you dare
To become so real
When you're just a ghost in me


Here in the back of my mind
Deep in the back of my mind




 She lays on the wall
Watching the strangers drift away
Mid-day's ore--thick
With the sun of arabia
She surrenders her voices
They gather, on the wind
Talkin, chanting, breathing
Into her body...Yesterday
Awakened beside
The scent of burnt sugar--on the skin
Painting eyes--thick
With the color she brings in
Oh, and sure and strong
When the lightning tumbles down
Don't you frown
Everything will be
In time for this evening

If there's secrets
She has to be pardoned to
Every one of them
If there's heaven
She gets to the heart

And you'll know...
Why she says
When i run out of blue
Help me rise instead
Then i will run to you
Why she says
When i run out of blue
Give me rain instead
Now let me run... (let me run)



Hey-hey....
Why she says
When i run out of blue
Help me rise instead
Then i will run to you
Why she says
When i run out of blue
Give me rain instead
Then i will run to you




 Duran Duran (Ft. Mr. Hudson) – Paper Gods

All the paper Gods in the sky of gray
All the fools in town are ruling today, today

Bow to the paper Gods in a world that is paper thin
The fools in town are ruling now
Bleeding from paper cuts, money for head shots
Fools leading (today)
Who needs it?
 Duran Duran
Hey girl, want it all the talking men declares
Go running to be first in line for what? Nobody cares
The next thing you must have, find peace with matching bag
It's nothing to be glad about, or sad when you forget about it
And while the race is on, the rats will run the streets
The slaver in a sweatshop, putting trainers on your feet
I'm walking through the rain, oblivious to pain
To shelter from the blame without a reason to complain about it
Oh, oh, oh, don't complain about it
Oh, oh, oh, don't complain about it
Oh, oh, oh, forget about it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
 Mr. Hudson

 Duran Duran
She's staring out in underwear, from your computer screen
It's all on sale for dirty cash, we can wash it clean
So hang it out online, confess and you'll feel fine
And if you got the time to spare we want to know
Which name you're wearing
And when the final curtain finally comes down
We'll all be in the party room, no wiser as to how
The total human race became a basket case
It's nothing to lose face about it
It's really not a place to doubt it

Bow to the paper Gods in a world that is paper thin
The fools in town are ruling now
Bleeding from paper cuts, money for head shots
Fools leading (today)
Who needs it?


Paper Gods falling down
Paper house, paper town
Paper Gods falling down
Paper world just falling down
Paper Gods falling down
Paper house, paper town
Paper Gods falling down
Paper world just falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down
Falling down, falling down

Bow to the paper Gods in a world that is paper thin
The fools in town are ruling now
Bleeding from paper cuts, they go for the money shots
The fools leading (today)
Who needs them?

All the paper Gods in the sky of gray
All the fools in town are ruling today, today

 Just a Perfect Day
Drank Sangria in the Park
And Later, when it gets dark
We go Home
Just A Perfect Day
Feed Animals in the Zoo
And Later, a movie too
And then Home

It's Such a Perfect Day
I'm Glad I spent it with you
Such a Perfect Day
You Just keep me hanging on 

Just a Perfect Day
Problems all Left Alone
Weekenders on our own
Such Fun
Just a Perfect Day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone new


You're gonna reap just what you sow

 Only came outside to watch the night fall with the rain
I heard you making patterns rhyme
Like some new romantic looking for the tv sound

Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop this is planet earth

 Look where we are
We've travelled so far
To gather here
And sum up the year
Across the fields
The lights turn on
And still they come
To hear the drum
The drum, the drum
Friends we come here calling
Can you hear the planet roaring?
Now the stars are falling
We'll be singing to the morning
This burning sky
This burning man
Will fire up the night
We'll light up the land
At liberty
The world to see
We carry on
We are the song
The song, the song
Friends we come here calling
Can you hear the planet roaring?
Now the stars are falling
We'll be singing to the morning
The things we do to be together
Things we take to feel together
Everything is coming up for you
Everybody do what you wanna do
It's the sound of celebration
The things we do to be together
Things we take to feel together
Everything is coming up for you
Everybody do what you wanna do
It's the sound of celebration




 In for an evening
Of light entertainment
And who would believe you
Could worry the neighbours?
Come on over to my place
Playing with uranium
If it blows up in your face
See you on the other side
Come on over to my place
Playing with uranium
Reinvent the human race
You just got the invitation
We go undiscovered
Because people are careless
One way or another
They'll never forget us
Come on over to my place
Playing with uranium
And if it blows up in your face
See you on the other side
Come on over to my place
Never be the same again
Reinvent the human race
You just got the invitation
Playing with uranium
Playing with uranium
Never be the same again
Because we're playing with uranium




 The random aspects of our lives
Come together once in a while
So blinding and decidedly
Naivete falls from our eyes
And we'll not regain
As we watch the tower falling down

Maybe things can change
Only if you want
Maybe things can change
Only if you want

You know, you know there's no avoiding
The lesson to be learned
The lesson to be learned
The point of no return
You say "What if?"
But can you live it?
It's all that we deserve
It's all that we deserve
The point of no return
Don't blame yourself
Don't blame me
But we're the ones
Who can feed the ground
So this poison tree, don't let it grow again
And from this glass and broken earth
There is a way that can be built
A better life for everyone

 Saw a close up of your pretty face
Overnight sensation
Smiling for cameras
From all around the world
If I rewind back to yesterday
And stop the tape there
No one knew who you were
But now they're at your door

I'm living in a pop trash movie
We star together in every scene
We'll all be famous for just a few minutes
Part of a celluloid dream

Watching slow-motion going frame-by-frame
Might have blurred my vision
Your life went flashing by
Where did it all go wrong?


I'll wait in the wings for you
I'll read your lines to you
But now the script is final you know, it's time to go
So we'll have to say goodbye




 Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, and jumpin' up and
Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, and jumpin' up and
Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, and jumpin' up and
Pressure off, pressure off, pressure pressure pressure off

Past is another country
The present will never last
The future, it's still tomorrow
Are we living too fast?

Searchlight the crowd, I'm fixed on your face
I know it well, but it's a dream I can't place
Something is happening to me
Maybe it's happening to you, you, you, you

Everybody everywhere, feel it in the air
Oh yeah, it's time to take the pressure off
Everybody everywhere, step out into the future
It's time to take the pressure off

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
It's up to you now
It's time to take the pressure off
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
It's up to you now
It's time to take the pressure off

Steppin'
Steppin'
Steppin'
It's time to take the pressure off

Swimming with the rat race
Or running against the tide
It's everybody's business when there's nowhere to hide

Searchlight the crowd, I'm fixed onto you
There's a way out of this into the blue
Something is happening to me
Maybe it's happening to you, you, you, you

Everybody everywhere, feel it in the air
Oh yeah (oh yeah), it's time to take the pressure off
Everybody everywhere, step out into the future
It's time to take the pressure off

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
It's up to you now
It's time to take the pressure off
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
It's up to you now
It's time to take the pressure off

Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, and jumpin' up and
Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, and jumpin' up and
Steppin' out, steppin' out, steppin' out, and jumpin' up and
Pressure off, pressure off, pressure pressure pressure off

I'm lost, don't wanna be found
I'm up and not gonna be down
Outside looking in on myself
Just me, I couldn't be anyone else
Is it bad when you're feeling this good?
Are we all misunderstood?
It's fine, going out of my mind
Going out of my mind, going out of my mind

Everybody everywhere (yeah), feel it in the air (whoo!)
Oh yeah (oh yeah), it's time to take the pressure off
Everybody everywhere, step out into the future
It's time to take the pressure off

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
It's up to you now
It's time to take the pressure off
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
It's up to you now
Step out into the future

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Jump up into the future
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Step out into the future
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Jump up into the future
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Step out into the future




 (Le Bon, Rhodes, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor)
Pony up girl, show and tell - go Chanel on crocodile
Hipster low slung lazy feet
Hit the street latino style
Going down to the disco
Where she's gonna star in some fiasco
Anywhere the party's on
Break of day - San Tropez to Fresno, she's the type
And another thing... (you pretty ones)
We love the way you are
We'll do anything (you pretty ones)
Older than n'est paz
All the pretty ones (you pretty ones)
Love the way you are
You pretty ones (you pretty ones)
La la la la la
Here she comes, off the rail - DNA laced with nicotine
Shame the sun
Walking proud, talking loud for all you glamour queens
We're going down to the disco
And we're gonna grind out a floor show
Everyday's a change
'round the world - Daddy's girl wherever she may be
And another thing... (you pretty ones)
We love the way you are
We'll do anything (you pretty ones)
Older than n'est paz
All the pretty ones (you pretty ones)
Love the way you are
You pretty ones (you pretty ones)
La la la la la




 "Bring back that child," she said
Spare me the price of freedom
Cold is my baby's head
Blown by the wind of reason
Even the rage behind
Cries out to see
We're still standing
Under the closing edge
Pay for the crime of feeling

When all your pride is dead
You must be scared instead

A quiet word is my Proposition
A promise made of a fierce day
A body bleeds for this coalition
Without surrender if you stay

"Show me my youth," she cried
Wasted for desolation
Hold up the sacrifice
Pull down your institution
Resting while anger flies
Question's the same
Who's deciding after the clouds have lain
Shame on your generation




 Now the time has come, the music between us
Though the night seems young - is at an end
Only change will bring you out of the darkness
In this moment everything is born again


Now the fireball burns, we go round together
As the planet turns into the light
Something more than dreams to watch out for each other?
Because we know what it means to be alive




 Now the time has come
The music's between us
Though the night seems young
Is at an end
Only change will bring
You out of the darkness
In this moment everything
Is born again
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Now the fireball burns
We go 'round together
As the planet turns
Into the light
Something more than dreams to
Watch out for each other
'Coz we know what it means
To be alive
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Feel the new day enter your life
Feel the new day
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life




 I got something
You got nothing to lose
I could give you
So much more than you're used to
Move a little closer
Maybe we can slip away
Right now we could use a little privacy
All too much attention from your friends in here
Move a little closer
Trust me
I'm not on the make
(That's a lie
If I could pull you over
C'mon lady, what d'you say

Get a grip
Don't resist
Read my lips

It's a trip
Ain't a risk
Read my lips


Part of you wanna get lucky
Part of you wanna go trade
Part of you wanna come looking
Part of you want to stay
(ROCK IT)



She's all mine




 Dark sun rose on the ridge cut clear across the sky
As good a day as any to die
No reservation madam
No reason to know why
Running late stiletto heels
Try to loosen up the wheels
You spend your life in preparation for this day
Breathe in the air; it's loaded with fame
Check out those weapons sister before you hit the fray
String of pearls meet bits of gems
Enter the battle of the lenses

Red carpet massacre
Don't want to hassle you
Red carpet massacre
Death stalk paparazzi yeah
Red carpet massacre
It's going to mess with you
We're in business
You're on the hit list

There's not so many now still standing on their feet
Their knives are out and singing so sweet
Engage with sharper minds that cut you when you meet
Any place to mess around
When someone wants to take you down
Maybe you think you're above this
But baby we know that you love it
Baby you know where to shove it
Apply your lipstick
For dying in public




 (instrumental)




 Moving on the floor now babe you're a bird of paradise
Cherry ice cream smile I suppose it's very nice
With a step to your left
And a flick to the right you catch that mirror way out west
You know you're something special and you look like you're the best

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

I've seen you on the beach and I've seen you on TV
Two of a billion stars it means so much to me
Like a birthday or a pretty view
But then I'm sure that you know it's just for you

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twisting through a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande

At the end of the drive the lawmen arrive
You make me feel alive, alive alive
I'll take my chance cause luck is on my side or something
I know what you're thinking
I tell you something I know what you're thinking

Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand
Just like that river twists across a dusty land
And when she shines she really shows you all she can
Oh Rio, Rio dance across the Rio Grande
Her name is Rio she don't need to understand
And I might find her if I'm looking like I can
Oh Rio, Rio hear them shout across the land
From mountains in the north down to the Rio Grande

 People say you've been around
How 'bout you and me get down?
How 'bout you and me get down?
Babe, I know you've been around
Unmake your bed
Don't think about what lies ahead
Don't you wanna be misled
Don't you wanna be misled
Fame, seems a far off day
When enough was never enough
Vain, how I played my hand
One more reckless man in the rough
Strange, how we explain the story
That we've lived through
Change, my karma train
The person I can be for you is
Safe
(Safe in the heat of the moment)
A stillness that comes to me
When I'm close to you
Safe
(Safe at the speed of atonement)
A feeling that runs so deep
That it scares me too
Dazed by my own escape
From the single state I was used to
Face my catch twenty two
Can I stay this way if I choose to?
Wrong, to be so contained
Now I can't explain what is happening
Strong, is the human chain
As it pulls me through, what I bring to you is
Safe
(Safe in the heat of the moment)
A stillness that comes to me
When I'm close to you
Safe
(Safe at the speed of atonement)
A feeling that runs so deep
That it scares me too
Safe
(Safe in the heat of the moment)
A stillness that comes to me
When I'm close to you
Safe
(Safe at the speed of atonement)
A feeling that runs so deep
That it scares me too
Fame, seems a far off day
When enough was never enough
Vain, how I played my hand
One more reckless man in the rough
Hook a finger, wink an eye
Caresses running up your thigh
Scratch my surface, dig in deep
There's always secrets left to keep
Safe not sound, who made these rules
Crowd control for enlightened fools
So come on boy, let's change the pace
Come feel the chill of my embrace
People say you've been around
How 'bout you and me get down?
How 'bout you and me get down?
Babe, I know you've been around
Unmake your bed
Don't think about what lies ahead
Don't you wanna be misled
Don't you wanna be misled
Safe
(Safe in the heat of the moment)
A stillness that comes to me

When I'm close to you

 People say you've been around
How about you and me get down?
Babe I know you've been around
Unmake your bed
Don't think about what lies ahead
Don't you want to be misled?

Fame, seems a far off day
When enough was never enough
Vain, how I played my hand

 (Le Bon, Rhodes, Taylor, Taylor, Taylor)
Something to remember
In some far off time
When you get that lonely shine in your eye
Dreams and lovers
Ever wonder why
When everything starts breaking down
They're reaching for the sky
You are forever
All I understand
I hold forever
Here within my hands
Picking through the pieces
And what do you have at all?
Just the danger of relying on those who'd let you fall
So you try, try much harder
Until the truth is drawn
The very thing you've been searching for
Has been yours all along
We are forever
All we understand
This is forever
Here within our hands




 You saw me standing by the wall, corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun, so you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes, and where to go

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now, save it 'til the morning after

Feel the breeze deep on the inside, look you down into your well
If you can, you'll see the world in all his fire
Take a chance, like all dreamers can't find another way
You don't have to dream it all, just live a day

Don't say a prayer for me now, save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now, save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after

Pretty looking road
Try to hold the rising floods that fill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise
Melt the ice
And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand
But we can call it paradise

Don't say a prayer for me now
Save it 'til the morning after
No, don't say a prayer for me now, save it 'til the morning after
Save it 'til the morning after

 Wise on a birthday party in a world full of surprising fireworks
And sudden silence sh
Lying on a strangers bed the new day breaks like a speeding train or an old friend
Ever expected but never knocking
Holding your own in a battered car all night parties cocktail bars
And smile when the butterfly escapes the killing jar

Sure eyes awake before the dancing is over wise or naked in secret October

Free fall on a windy morning shore nothing but a fading track of footsteps
Could prove that you never been there
Spoken on a cotton cloud like the sound of gunshot taken by the wind
And lost in distant thunder racing on a shining plain
And tomorrow you'll be content to watch as the lightning plays along the wires and you'll wonder




 Oh woman you make me feel
Like I'm on fire
Oh woman you make it real
It's the only way for me

 Shackled and raised for a shining crowd
They want you to speak but the music is louder than
All of their roar with the heat of the planet's core-but

The shadows are on your side
As soon as the lights go down
In the darkest place you can find
You belong to the hands of the night

Promises made with a distant friend
Truth should be known it can only bend
To a tune of its own
Hey you'll never hear that voice again
Scandal in white on a tangled vine
With everybody to say that you're having the
Time of your life when your life is on the slide-but


Spinning a compass to choose your way
You can run you can dive you can stand and you can soar
Whichever way you can be sure-that


Shadows on your side
The shadows are on your side




 I watch you from my window working this vicious road
You shudder when the wind blows
Girl you're looking beat and cold
Don't know your situation but you look so alone to me
In my imagination this is how the message reads

Reaching out, calling out for your love, babe
Just come softly to me
Reaching out, calling out for your love
For your love, babe
In the shelter of my heart

Trust my intuition, you're the one I've got to know
I give without condition, wouldn't try to save your soul
Money or reputation doesn't mean a thing to me
Special communication - it's the only thing we need

Reaching out... Calling out
Just come softly to me
Calling out... Hear me now
In the shelter of my heart

Reaching out
(Reaching out calling out for your love babe)
Hear me now
Calling out do you read me?
(In the shelter of my heart)
Calling out...
(Reaching out calling out for your love, for your love babe)
Hear me now
Just come softly to me
Here is no hurt to feel
Here is safe for lips unsealed
In the shelter of my heart

Reaching out calling out for your love, babe
Just come softly to me
Reaching out calling out for your love, for your love, babe
In the shelter of my heart

Reaching out
Hear me now
Calling out
Do you read me? 

Reaching out
(Reaching out calling out for your love, for your love babe)
Hear me now
Calling out
Do you read me? 




 She's gentle to the touch
She's everything head first
So happy to be causing trouble
Sometimes
The pressure gets too much
And you think she's going to burst
And shatter like a Christmas bauble
I'll be there when the world is
Coming down upon her
When she's scared, I'll be there
Fighting in her corner
She cries when she's alone
For all life's little knocks
Everything is supposed to make us tougher
Thinking is doesn't really show
But I know how she hurts
And I can't bare to see her suffer
I'll be there when the world is
Coming down upon her
When she's scared, I'll be there
Fighting in her corner
I'll be there when the walls are closing to surround her
In the air as she falls with my arms around her

Holding on I'm looking out for
Her thin skin
Because she's everything
And I don't think she knows

She's such a gentle touch
She's too much a gentle touch
She likes to catch the sun
Plays with it like a ball
And never mind whatever keeps it burning
Someday, she might just be the one
Whose going to save us all
If this Apocalypse is coming
I'll be there when the world is
Coming down upon her
When she's scared, I'll be there
Fighting in her corner
I'll be there when the walls are closing to surround her
In the air as she falls with my arms around her


I don't think she knows
I don't think she knows
(she's too much)
I don't think she knows
(she's too much) a gentle touch




 Shotgun
Get it together
Thing is jumping
I wanna see your
Bullets pumping
Shotgun
Itchy finger
On the trigger
Got to make the
Shooter bigger
Shotgun




 Following the love we receive
Holding on to what you believe
Following the life we receive
Holding on to what you believe
Following the love we receive
Holding on to what you believe
Following the life we receive
Holding on to what you believe
Time is a ribbon, a silent icy river, fools us all
Running deep, deep and fast enough
To get lost down in the flow thrashing around me
These tiny lives mean everything
Following the love we receive
Holding on to what you believe
Following the life we receive
Holding on to what you believe




 You shine
Where others fade
You dare
To be so brave
Don't compromise
No one can touch you
Just believe
Just believe
Come to heaven, silva halo
Silva halo




 Stand bold, for the ride
Right now, you know that is the place to be
To watch humankind, stumble into another century
Take no prisoners
Their sure at giving you the run-around
Violance, on your mind
Cus your attention is the battleground
What are you?
A sinner or saint
You gotta be
A sinner or saint
Ice cool walawyers
Straight up and guerentee your gonna get
All that you deserve
Sit down, blockin your way, seen nothin yet
(chorus)
What are you?
That is your fate
You gotta be
A sinner or saint
Some poeple love too fast
Some people live too long
And so I've got to ask
Do you know right from wrong?
Disa-ssembler, will you ever, really be a saint...
Still on for the ride
Who cares if you loose or win
They can bleed you dry
When you're, a pumping the adrenelin
(chorus)
What are you?
It's never too late
You gotta be
A sinner or saint..




 Coat check girl up in happyland
Has a violent row with a cuban man
Julio leaves in a drunken rage
Comes back with the gasoline
The club has no fire exit
The club had no door
Only five people came out alive
The sin is that 89 died
89 dead
89 dead
89 dead
89 dead
The sin is that a year and a half
Before the fire chief's out
And he's raising cain brands
Happyland hazzard close down but no
No-one ever paid him no mind
City living heavy trouble
City living rough
We are given angry heart
But angers not enough
Daily news reviews of the landlords life
Found six thousand code violations light
The city has more a hundred thousand wars
All for one of forbes' four hundred whores
Just one fire cracker on a big bonfire
Of self serving penny pinching wiseguy style
Never allowing for the human condition
The sin is that these guys survive
City living heavy trouble
City living rough
We are given angry heart
But anger's not enough... Rpt
You're using your people up
Stop killing your people now
Stop wasting your people now
Sin of the city




 Walking under skies
Waiting for the fall
Meet me at the corner shop I'll show you it all
Free you of your mind
Something you won't find
In the west-end pages with your google dirty fingers
It's a skin dive
In deep silence we are
Going underwater
It's a lifeline
Teardrop, bullets, all night
Dip into the water

Baby, that's what it feels like when you come up for air
When you come up for air
You feel brand new
When you come up for air
When you come up for air

Wipe us of the face
Of the human race
Whichever way you look it's indisposed or disgraced
Fighting on the shore
The hoi polloi want more
Howling bloody murder but it's nothing just a murmur
In your skin dive
In deep silence we are
Going underwater
It's a lifeline
Teardrop, bullets, all night
Slip into the water


A blushing rose is torn
From these sugar walls
I've misplaced my future could I please borrow yours?
Panic on the scene
You know what I mean
Anything you want to be the only thing you want from me
Is skin dive
In deep silence we are
Going underwater
It's a lifeline
Teardrop, bullets, all night
Go inside the water

Baby girl you're swimming
A little too deep
So deep, that I think you might hit a reef
I think you low on oxygen
And you're too glad to leave
Baby girl swim to the top
Grab my hand and hold me and breathe




 Working on the weekend, baby
She's working all through the night
A jump into the deep end gave her
The evidence she required
Takes five; she's got pearls
Don't fake it when it comes to making money
So she smiles. But that's cruel
If you know what she thinks
If you knew what she was after
Sometimes she wonders
And she laughs in her frustration

Would someone please explain
The reason for this strange behavior
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade

Doctors of the revolution gave us
The medicine we desired
Besides being absolutely painless
It's a question of compromise
They got steel
So cool to get angry at the weekend
And go back to school
So big deal; it's what rule
When it comes to making money
Say yes, please; thank you
Sometimes you wonder, and ask yourself the question

 Do you know how to feel?
Do you know what it means?

Rock-a-bye baby it's time to break
The habit that you fed
Sweet sorrow while the cherished dead
Blow in my mouth, every breath I take
Although I need you I don't want to bleed for you

So long suicide
Going right out of sight, out of mind
Leave me alone and abandoned
Hello, I'm alive
I'm loaded alive, yes, I know
In my bones I know what is going to do it for me

I steal the beauty and I taste the hurt
There's always time for pretty flowers
Growing in the dirt
But time is your needle aimed to my heart
And I must be hollow because I can't follow there


Hello I'm alive
I'm loaded alive yes I know
In my bones I know what I'm doing

And I'm scared of being ordinary
God I swear to live like anyone
And you know it's hard to swallow
But life goes on
And after all this crash and swell
We are just human
And after all is said and done
We're only human
You're out of sight and out of mind

I'm saying so long suicide
The half-dreamed shade of yesterday
In bloom tomorrow




 Now while the beat is slow
Here in your arms I sway
Now that the light is low
Something I want to say
I guess you've known it for a while
But I mean trouble
I only want to see you smile
And I burst this bubble
The hardest thing is to let go
When love is real
Like a flower loves a bee

But I know you're meant to give yourself
To someone else, Not me

And I could carry on with you
Does that sound crazy?
I think you feel the same way too
And you can't face it
The hardest thing is to let go
But it's not defeat
When you set somebody free


Can you let go?
Because that's love that's real
Like a flower loves a bee


Somebody else not me
Meant for somebody else not me
Somebody else not me




 Acuestate junto a mi
Que la noche ya llego
No prendas la luz mi amor
Te tengo una confesion
Desde hace tiempo has de saber
No quiero herirte
Me importa tu felicidad
Pero no se como
Y lo peor es el adios
Si el amor es grande
Como abeja en la flor
Ce que tu te quieres entregar
A alguien que no soy yo
Podria seguir contigo si
Y suena loco
Tal vez te pase igual que a mi
Mas no lo aceptes
Y lo peor es el adios
Si el amor es grande
No sentir que te perdi
Se que tu te quieres entregar
A alguien que no soy yo
Alguien que no soy yo
Te puedes ir
Pues mi amor es grande
Como abeja en la flor
Se que tu te quieres entregar
A alguien que no soy yo
Alguien que no soy yo
Busques alguien que no soy yo
Alguien que no soy yo
Busques alguien que no soy yo
Alguien que no soy yo
Buscas alguien que no soy yo....

Quand je suis dans tes bras
Je n'ai plus rien à dire
J'aime quand tout est lent
Pour mieux nous attendrir
Depuis longtemps, tu le savais
Ma vie s'écroule
Je voulais juste que tu sois bien
Mais j'ai brisé le lien
Et c'est si dur de te quitter...
Quand l'amour est vrai
Comme la fleur aime l'abeille
Mais je sais qu'tu pars
Pour te donner à quelqu'un d'autre que moi
Je voulais tant que cela dure
Comment te le dire
Depuis longtemps, tu le sentais
Mais n'en voulais plus
Et le plus dur c'est d'accepter...
Mais c'est pas la fin
De mes espoirs sur nous deux
Et même si tu pars
Pour te donner à quelqu'un d'autre que moi
Aimer un autre que moi
Vas-tu lâcher ?
Ça, c'est l'amour vrai
Comme la fleur aime l'abeille
Et tu sais qu'tu pars
Pour te donner à quelqu'un d'autre que moi
Aimer un autre que moi
Juste pour aimer un autre que moi
Juste pour aimer un autre que moi
Juste pour aimer un autre que moi
Juste pour aimer un autre que moi




 I,.......So misled

In the summer of a London life
"Gold," she said
Was a month before I realised
"Sold" instead
Babe, it's such an awful choice
Don't break my back
Take it easy now, your whipping boy
Don't wanna feel the crack
Trust my head to say lose it
Now my body's got to use it

I should not be so misled

Saw an advert in a magazine
Safe it said, with the satisfaction
Guaranteed to cool your head
I can't see the solution
To this state of confusion




 I've been in this grass here for the last ten hours
My clothes are dirty but my mouth isn't dry
How does it happen does it fly through the air
Woah I gave up asking days away I gave up asking days away

And now I'm lying here waiting for the sound of thunder
Waiting for the sound of thunder

Here I am I'm a dotted line cut in through corners stick me through your door
I'm the man who stepped off the path
Am I just lying here that's what I was made for
And now my eyes are closing but I still feel the land
Leaning out for the touch of my hand
The world spins so fast that I might fly off




 How to begin do I shed a skin?
Now that I am starting to remember
It takes a while
But you find a way to open up the door
Let demons walk
Now that I am starting to remember
Can't change my world
I was happy ever after
Was it only yesterday?
That I bought the dream?
But I don't sleep no more
Counting the hours
Until the dawn
Now that I am starting to remember
How to love
How to learn draw like a child
Run for miles and miles
Now that I am starting to remember
Who I am
Another lonely night ahead for me now
Buried in the darkening day
That lingers on
And drags me down
But you've got to believe
Time will heal




 Home, it's not brick or stone
Or comfort in the firelight
Not in that sense anyway
Dreams, if only I had known
But these things always seem
So much clearer at a distance

I'm walking out of this town
I'm never going back there
I'm never going back there
I'd burn the place to the ground
I'm never going back there
I'm never going back there again

Words only could break that ring
You know the words still sting
So much harder than the blows ever did
Heart, though it's hot and violent
My head is cool and quiet
As the ashes that fall from the sky


Now, I know this shattered feeling
Trampled but still breathing




 Stop!
Stop!
Stop dead
Stop stop stop stop stop stop
I pulled up at a west end junction (seeker of attention)
A full body kit and bass bins pumping (size up competition)
Come on red light, get into green
I hit the brake, I must be dreaming..
I'm stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)
Got to fix on you
Don't wanna lose you from my sight
Where ya going to?
Gotta know now..
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)
Got to fix on you
Don't wanna lose you from my sight
Where ya going to?
Oh-oh-oh
I've got my eyes on the action (killer reputation)
Heat crazed in full satisfaction (become a phaser?)
Do what you do and do it to me
Body in motion, now you see me
(chorus)
Gotta know know.. Stop!
Come on now, Come on now
Come on now, Come on now
Wise up to remain young victim (come on, ways of attraction)
A full scale attack on the system (come on, no one visor?)
Do what you do and do it to me
I'm into red line territory
And I'm..
(chorus)
Stop!, dead in my tracks again
I'm stop dead in my tracks
Stop!, in my tracks (yeah)
I'm stop dead in my tracks
(oh-oh) Gotta know now..
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)
Stop! (stop), dead! (dead), in my tracks (in my tracks)




 Here comes success
Over my hill
Here comes success
Here comes my car
Here comes my Chinese rug
Here comes success
Yeow!

In the last ditch
I'll think of you
In the last ditch
I will be true
Sweetheart, I'm telling you
Here comes the zoo

Here comes success
Hoo-ray success
Oh oh success
Hoo-rah success
Oh Oh Sucess
I can't help myself
I just
Got to 
I can't stand it!
I need success

Ah, Ah, Ah

Here comes my face
It's plain bizzare
Here comes my face
Out of the crowd
Sweetheart I'm telling you
Here comes the zoo

Oh oh oh

Baby lets blast off
We blast of for success
I'm going to crash my car
I'm going to wear a dress
Oh you slay me baby
Were going to do the twist
Were going to hop like a frog
Cause we love success

Da, da, da, da, da




 Now the time has come
The music's between us
Though the night seems young
Is at an end
Only change will bring
You out of the darkness
In this moment everything is born again
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Now the fireball burns
We go round together
As the planet turns into the light
Something more than dreams to
Watch out for each other
Coz we know what it means to be alive
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Feel the new day enter your life
Feel the new day
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life
Reach up for the sunrise
Put your hands into the big sky
You can touch the sunrise
Feel the new day enter your life

 So halfway drunk
You'd never fail
With your big eye punk
Fashion fingernails
Something cooking
When you play guitar
What a stake we're in
How did we get so far?

Whatever happens, we're okay
Hey, we're still alive
To watch a sunset garage day
Head into the light
Oh, oh with that all goes wrong
We're gonna make it on our own
I promise us a garage day, oh

See how the town comes out
Like a bruise
When the wheels go round
We can do anything
Nobody looking
And then 6 more come
Maybe later, later
Could take it up from here

Whatever happens, we're okay
Hey, we're still alive
To watch a sunset garage day
Head into the light
Oh, oh with that all goes wrong
We're gonna make it on our own
Oh, oh, if they bring us down
We're gonna break out of this town
Into a sunset garage day, oh


Yesterday looks so taint, so far away
Dumbest point of desseray
Waiting for a sun burn into rain
It's so fine, about the high water life
Shifting with the paradise
Drifting as the drain move into flame

Oh, oh with that all goes wrong
We're gonna make it on our own
Oh, oh, if it all goes wrong
We're gonna make it on our own
It's a sunset garage day, oh yeah!
It's a sunset garage day, oh yeah, yeah
It's a sunset garage day, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can you, can you taste the summer?
I do, I find it in your mouth
Now if I have a weakness it's for sweetness
And it's... floating on your breath, the sweetest melody


Sure we can make it till the evenings
Cool haze is reflected off your thighs
Long days are coming up and staying up and playing
Music of the falling stars, a melody (melody...)

 The afternoon, it's one maybe two
Sipping away my last gold star, not so much to do
Dream away the sunny day until it's time to leave
I'll just watch you pass on by
When I'm on my own in tel aviv
With the blocks to one side
The beach on the other
And the trees and the leaves
On my own in tel aviv
And the trees and the leaves
On my own in tel aviv




 You've been rising through the flow
You require a little bit more
To excite, you will go
Getting busy on the floor
All about the way you move it
When you really got to prove it
Finally you will know
What it is you're turning on

I am here to tempt you, oh yeah
Like you know I'm meant to, oh yeah
Devil going to tempt you, oh yeah
How much do you want to? Oh, oh

Get back to London, coming undone
When you ride the underground
Some misguidance, breaking silence
Got your body started now
And you love the way you're moving
When you really got to prove it
Finally it's what you do
What it is you're turning on


Night is going to tempt you, oh yeah
Like you know it's meant to, oh yeah
Devil going to tempt you, oh yeah
Devil going to tempt you, oh yeah
If you want to know, oh yeah
Do you want to know? Oh yeah
What it is you're turning on
What it is you're turning on
If you want to know
What it is you're turning on
Do you want to know
What it is you're turning on




 If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die
My, my, my
Inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration, look to see
And so today, my world it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
Thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Happiness, no longer sad
Happiness....I'm glad




 Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving
All looking for a new place to drive
You sit beside me, so newly charming
Sweating dew drops glisten, refreshing your side

The sun slips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart
Sing Blue Silver

Way down the lane away, living for another day
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
Swim seagull in the sky
Towards that hollow western isle
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze


And watching lovers part, I feel you smiling
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
To tear out from your eyes
With a word to stiffen brooding lies
But I'll only watch you leave me further behind




 Out on the tar plains, the glides are moving
All looking for a new place to drive
You sit beside me so newly charming
Sweating dewdrops glisten freshing your side

And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart
Way down the lane away, living for another day
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
Swim seagull in the sky towards that hollow western isle

To tear out from your eyes, with a thought to stiffen brooding lies
And I'll only watch you leave me further behind

Sing Blue Silver
Sing, sing, Blue Silver
(There's more to this kind of camouflage)
(More than just color and shape)
(Who's going now, in to a classiomatic?)

There's more to this kind of camouflage
More than just colour and shape
Who’s crawling now, in the tall grass near my tent?

 Walk the edge of america
A concrete beach to scrape my hand
Inside the subway stinking fear and shame
Becomes the violent breath
Vigilantes out on dawn patrol
But now there's nothing left to hide
I'm just a number on the metal fence
Which marks the great divide

Hey boy
Give your dreams a rest
If you're tired of searching
This is where it ends
There's nothing left to lose
Nothing to protest
Learn to love your anger now
Anger here is all you possess
Welcome to the edge

Below the towers of the citadel
Seems someone overlooked the cost
Forgotten soldier of paradise
Now paradise is lost
Recognition never realized
Salvation lost among the crowd
So tell me beside this sterile sea
Where is your nation now?




 Walk the edge of America
Concrete beach to scrape my head
Inside the subway stinking fear and shame
Becomes the violent breath
Hey boy, give your dreams a rest
If you're tired of searching

Nothing to protest
Learn to love your anger now
Anger here is all you possess
Welcome to the edge




 Do you know where we are?
I'm longing for the dark
Of our nocturnal life
It begins and ends with you
Don't spill my secret
You were once running wild hiding in the morning mist
Game demands I make you mine
I thought that I could resist but the leopard in you
Silently preyed on me
(Simon Le Bon & Kelis)
I made my way back home
(did you follow her?)
I handled her with care
(were you in control?)
So elegant and sleek
(were you not afraid?)
I need her to be near
(does she belong to you?)
Don't spill my secret
You were once running wild hiding in the morning mist
Game demands I make you mine
Thought that I could resist but the leopard in you
Silently preyed on me
(Simon Le Bon & Kelis)
Deserted by my friends
(don't they understand?)
She's so much more than them
(how could they compare?)
So now she's just for me
(no one else can see)
I watch her while she sleeps
(be sure she dreams of you)
Don't spill my secret
(Simon Le Bon & Kelis)
(It's been quite a while)
Since we were last outside
(and do you miss the chase?)
Now that we've both been tamed
(inside this gilded cage)
Prisoners of our thoughts
(you saved me from myself)
Don't spill my secret

You've gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the Valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger line
I'll cross that bridge when I find it

 Those words are all remainders
Echoes growing in the heart of twilight
They lay back laughing at naivety's star
Awaken all those whispers in the dusty shadow of a
Passing favor
I wouldn't say that you were ruthless or right
I couldn't see from so far
Was I chasing after rainbows
One thing for sure you never answered when I called
And I wiped away the water from my face

To look through the eyes of a stranger
For rumors in the wake of such a lonely crowd
Trading in my shelter for danger
I'm changing my name just as the sun goes down
In the eyes of a stranger

Can't tell the real from reflections
When all these faces look the same to me
In every city such a desolate dream
Some days are strange to number
Some say the seventh sounds a little bit stranger
A year of Sundays seems to have drifted right by
(I could have sworn) in one evening
And I'm not seized in desperation
No steel reproaches on the table from before
But I still can feel those splinters of ice


I must be chasing after rainbows
One thing for sure you never answer when I call
And I wipe away the water from my face




 At the end of the rainbow
Found each other there
Strange, we never thought the colours would fade
Be easy to walk
But it's much harder to stay
Why, oh why, are we reckless today?

You and I
Got to hold on together
Because in this life
Maybe the sun doesn't shine forever

Could say that I'm sorry
But there's no one to blame
Anger seems to dissolve into tears
Been so many good times
Not only despair
Somehow we'll find the love we can share




 It's beautiful, the dying sun
The end of everything and everyone
So shall we make a clan my friend
As if we have the chance to live it all again

I'll see you in some other lifetime
On the other side of what we'll never know
Together we have walked a fine line
Now we go to face the universe alone

In plain view, the mistakes we've made
But is there anything you'd really want to change?
To win and lose then win again
To have it all then throw it all away

I'll see you in some other lifetime
On the other side of what we'll never know
Together we have walked a fine line
Now we go to face the universe alone

How beautiful the closing down
The fading out, it spins and goes around
With darkness and the heart of man
And here we are back where it all began
I'll see you in some other lifetime
The universe alone
The universe alone
The universe alone




 These are days of hit and run
In the stream with everyone
Is a moment of our lives
On a wandering river
Going on together
Many journeys to arrive

I've been walking
Through the valley
Through the tall grass
And the shadows
And I feel it
I can see it
Yes I need it
I believe it
Through the city
And the towers
Turning minutes
Into hours
And I feel it
I can see it
Yes I need it
I believe it

When I think I'm being strong
And I lose direction
Then a life starts looking mischievous
Finding revelation
Out of desperation
Always stretching time
But it's never long enough
You think you're happy
Think you're free
But maybe we're just
Comfortably dizzy




 The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world
They tried to break us
Looks like they'll try again
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine
You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell
They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

Someone else saw their tracks and followed them, leaving a path
It seemed as though I were looking down the hill when I first saw it
But, as I waled on, I realized I was going up
Somebody whistled behind and turning round, they seemed far below
Then I came to where there had been a fire and was shaded
From the sun by the trees
Figure of eight. It's our year, it always was
Credentials:
Made of earth
Drinks water
Breathes air
Makes fire




 Instrumental Track




 Time for temptation, what you see is there for you
Time for temptation, no damnation for what you do
(good, good, good, good temptation)
Why you chasing a lost religion of guilty feelings
-that belong in yesterday?
Spy the preachers a politician, he carries the cross like a gun
- whip you into shape
Heres the rub, now, no secret hours locked in the backroom if you
- come together right
Check your vision and push it out there
- you make the question, define what its all about
(chorus)
(oh) Oh...
With chains or heaven across your shoulder
A slave for promotion to the afterlife
The boss gets fat while you just get older, here comes a mission
- set to put you right
Time for temptation, what you see is there for you
Time for temptation, no damnation for what you do - oh
Time for temptation, what you see is there for you
Time for temptation, no damnation for what you do
(No damnation...)
Time for temptation, what you see is there for you
Time for temptation, no damnation for what you do - oh
Time for temptation, what you see is there for you
Time for temptation, no damnation for what you do - oh
Time for temptation, what you see is there for you
(good, good, good, good temptation)
Time for temptation, no damnation for what you do
(good, good, good, good temptation)
Time for temptation, what you see is there for you
(good, good, good, good temptation)
Time for temptation, no damnation for what you do
(good, good, good, good temptation)
Time for temptation




 Here I go again
I must have flowers in my brain
The same mistake I made before
But I'm a hostage to that face of yours
Lay me on your bed
I watch you smoke my cigarette
I wish you knew what's in my head
I could be more than just a friend
Too bad you're so beautiful and so
Complicated
I may be a deluded fool but still
Fascinated
Too bad you're so beautiful when I'm
King of nothing
This can only go one way
Ice queen on top of the mountain
Give me the freeze, minus twenty and counting
My lunar dreams, how do I stop them?
But it's not your problem, when you're above it all
Lay me on your bed
I want to stroke your sleepy head
I wish that I was you instead
Of being just your weekday friend
Too bad you're so beautiful and so
Complicated
I may be a deluded fool but still
Fascinated
Too bad you're so beautiful when I'm
King of nothing
This can only go one way
King of nowhere speaks another line
In the low light I'm here to entertain
When it starts to rain
I'm a lucky man...
(Chorus)
Ahhhhhh
Too bad you're so it's too bad you're soooo....
Oh-oh-oh-ohhhh
Beautiful, umm-uh-umm
Beautiful, it's too bad
Just too bad, it's too bad
Beautiful, ohh-ohh
It's too bad
Just too bad, it's too bad




 Waking out of nowhere
And i let you in
Til my imagination went for a spin
I seen you every night
Been making out since then
And still i wonder why everybody's saying
That ice is thin

And i think i know you
Just a little bit by now
And i think i can show you
You see baby, i don't want to fight about it

Send down your rain
Then who's to blame
And you'll understand
Because its' much too late to change

Awaken to this hunger
And then watch my heat
Grow paler than the moonlight
That you made me eat
And if we run our lives
Along a one way street
We'll always wonder why every-time
It still tastes just as sweet


Send down your rain
Then who's to blame
You'll understand
Because it's much too late to change
I will explain
We're to much the same
No i won't leave
Because it's just too late marlene

 Oh when your nine day feed is up and you've drained your loving cup
Come stands reeling to the shore oh when the brave are coming out
The dry fight and the dusty shout see you crawling on the floor
And diamond stars shining glitter bright gorging your sanhedralites
Words are falling to the floor glad stand pouring fruit trees
And now they glisten on the waterline sing home you are at the shore
I'm moving crissie pretty flowers in the shuttermaze
Haul up all your petty desires leave them lying down they fall
Wash away the rusty disease of your brown town days in our silver sea
Leave it dying at the door feather yellow your time to leave
Open out your arms and breathe

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to the shore now
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh to the shore now come on




 Dear Mr.Bones, I've (we've) had enough
You can try to pull us down
With your pin-stripe weasel stuff
But word travels in this town
I wouldn't write home about you
We're better off without you
Without you, Mr.Bones

Some people feed on other people's troubles
Some people beat on other people's meat
Some people want to bleed us dry
And some people...Gonna down on your feet

You said "Boys, I'll get you more
But you have got to pay me by the hour"
Anyways you are just another bore
Who believes he's a superpower
When you talk about loyalty
I just hope you realize
Since you ate my royalties
Mr. Bones this is goodbye
This is goodbye and such hereinafter shall be refereed
Not withstanding or foregoing statements preferred
Don't claim you understand
When you've not heard a single word, a dicky bird

Hey wait a minute - news:
Here we go again
So open to abuse
So one night stand
It's just a milky breast
Oh gimme gimme yeah (woo-hoo)
We don't really care
We're watching cartoons
We want that music (we won't stop)
Bangin' on the radio (we love you)
And we want TV (stop)
What is gettin' on that video? (video)
We use it (we won't stop)
TV versus radio (we love you)
Believe me (stop)
We need it more than ever now, you know (video)
I'll get down on your knees
If that's what you love
A little striptease
A little push and show
Do you scroll your prayers
For daddy money, yeah (woo-hoo)
We don't really care
We're watching cartoons
We want that music (we won't stop)
Bangin' on the radio (we love you)
And we want TV (stop)
What is gettin' on that video? (video)
We use it (we won't stop)
TV versus radio (we love you)

 Here we stand
In the shadow of the master plan
Making trouble wherever we can
Stir it up, stir it up, stir it up
Can't you see this boy is going cheap -
Knockdown to a basement deal
But I really won't stop til I get to the top
Take it from me, I'm waiting here on my knees
And I love the way you tease me
(Oh) such a wonderful person
Don't play rough -
It's easy when you know your stuff
Say please and sure enough, so kind
I'm making love to the ultimate mind

Come on, take a look, put it to me, baby
You could feel a love come tumbling down
I just want to wrap myself in you baby
We could tell the world we're fooling around

Ultimately, I'd say she's toying with me
It's a case of wait and see
But right now I'm gonna keep my pants on
A to Zed, shes doing it to my head
We don't need to go to bed, you'll find
To make love to the ultimate mind

(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
Put it to me, baby
(you could feel a love...)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
Wanna wrap myself in you, baby
(We'll tell the world...)

Talk me round
Let's do it right here and now
I don't want you cooling down
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
We could fit reality's two-way split personality
Life's a bitch, but I'm fine
Making love to the ultimate mind
Heaven's bent, we're completely innocent
We all got to pay the rent
And in time we learn to compromise
Talking tall, but I feel invisible
Can you see me after all that I said
There's only one thing for it

Take a look, put it to me, baby
You could feel a love come tumbling down
I just want to wrap myself in you baby
We can tell the world were fooling around

(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
Come on, take a look, put it to me, baby
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
You could be a love come tumbling down
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
I just want to wrap myself in you baby
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
We could tell the world we're fooling around 

(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
Come on, take a look (put it to me baby)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh...)
I'm making love to the ultimate mind
Ultimate mind
Ultimate mind...




 We are undergoing treatment
Watching others in the news
Studying our worst reviews
They say we'll get over it
Disappear like dinosaurs
To the sound of small applause
Resign to the mid-price section

If you see me walking in the garden
Don't ever ask me for an autograph
If you ever catch me in the arcade
Don't even stop me for a photograph

We are undergoing treatment
Until our ethic fits the scene
Laid out in Q Magazine
They crave our conformity
Mediocre to the bone
Terrified testosterone
But why do we still face the music?

If you see me walking in the garden
Don't ever ask me
Now and then you get the strangest notion
That there's something missing
But it keeps you guessing
Wild ambition can you really blame us?
Can you entertain us?
Can you give a little more?


We are undergoing treatment
But will the doctors ever cure
These delusions of grandeur?




 Telegram force and ready
I knew this was a big mistake
There's a fine line drawing my senses together
And I think it's about to break

Give me anything even sympathy

 Down here with the strays and the damaged
All stood in a line
This recovery so they tell me is one day at a time
And you think you can help me maybe
You can turn on your heels and save me
But I don't want to be like the boys that you keep in tow
Like your valentine stones, stones, stones
Your valentine stones
All roads lead from my resurrection to your sympathy
An empty spaces which spoils your collection
That was meant for me
And you say you can help me maybe
You can turn on your charms to save me
But I don't want to be just a toy that you keep at home
Like your valentine stones, stones, stones
Your valentine stones
Lost souls diamonds and gold
Gone cold valentine stones
Lost souls diamonds and gold
Grown cold valentine stones
And you think you can help me maybe
You can turn on your heels and save me
But I don't want to be like the boys that you keep in tow
Like your valentine stones
- souls diamonds and gold
Gone cold valentine stones
Lost souls diamonds and gold
Grown cold valentine stones
Oh, oh, oh diamonds and gold
Oh, oh, oh valentine stones




 Venice breeding shy chimeras
Of sex and violence
In the purple evening silence
Venice dreaming of a partner
Fills your hands with breasts of marble
From the cradle to the table
Coax this naked treasure from
Your saviour

Come swim into my love
Come swim into my life

Divine blasphemer tempting
Holy beads of jism
With the scarlet catechism
Her lips will answer
(oh, her lips will answer
How to be ther perfect stranger
The perfect lover wanting
And as you'll discover...giving
And as you'll discover...being


The body stirs and is reanimated
Only briefly
But then life is very brief

Venice drowning




 Hey guys, turn it up to get sleazy, twist it in a vise
Nobody said it was easy, just use your naked eyes. (oh)
How to see and how to hide it
How to save it well...
Maybe, maybe, maybe
You could take it and eat it
Chew your life supply (oh)
Where's the real life, in your illusion
On the dark side - your powers and confusion
Do the dance
Do the demolition
And lose the chance to hear when you don't listen
Don't you feel edgy?
Bite your lips and bleed
Conversation is empty
Abandoned in the freeze
Freedom is the only condemnation
Free to say well..
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe -
You can take it or leave it
Just need a little hit tonight

 Meeting you
With a view to a kill
Face to face in secret places
Feel the chill
Nightfall covers me
But you know the plans I'm making
Still oversea
Could it be the whole Earth opening wide?
A sacred why
A mystery gaping inside
The weekend's why
Until we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sound of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
Choice for you
Is a view to a kill
Between the shades
Assassination standing still
First crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body
First time in years
To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die
Again we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sound of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
When all we see is the view to a kill




 Pick it up
This'll get you out of your head
China's hangin' out by the railings
Of the motorshed
She goes with a real hit biker
He's a metalhead
She looks me up and down
Talkin' dirty eyes
Sweet sayin' boy baby
I could lick ya any time
Keep it up
That's right...here we go again
Bit later I'm gonna run
Into her round the back
While other guys break heads
In the Shugar Shack
Don't give me drink I don't wanna
Get too stoned
Then we're gonna see who's gonna
Take who home
The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover
Those lips will make me rise
You may look down but don't think twice
Slow death is on the way
So what man I still want to play....
One, two
This'll get you out of your mind
This'll get you up...let's go
Maybe take a ride goin' south
Where her mother writes
Before bad news catches up
We still got a little time
We'll leave it all so far away
One thing is sure we shouldn't stay
I take it all little Chine gonna
Get the runaround a run... a runaround
The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover
China... na china...nanana
China... na china...nanana
China... na china...nanana
China... na china...nana
The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover...mmm... love's takin' over
Yes love's takin' over
Love's takin over...

Talkin' dirty eyes
Sweet sayin' boy baby
I could lick ya any time
Keep it up
That's right...here we go again
Bit later I'm gonna run
Into her round the back
While other guys break heads
In the Shugar Shack
Don't give me drink I don't wanna
Get too stoned
Then we're gonna see who's gonna
Take who home
The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover
Those lips will make me rise
You may look down but don't think twice
Slow death is on the way
So what man I still want to play....
One, two
This'll get you out of your mind
This'll get you up...let's go
Maybe take a ride goin' south
Where her mother writes
Before bad news catches up
We still got a little time
We'll leave it all so far away
One thing is sure we shouldn't stay
I take it all little Chine gonna
Get the runaround a run... a runaround
The violence of summer
A love's taking over
It starts with desire
Ends up under cover
China... na china...nanana
China... na china...nanana

Ends up under cover...mmm... love's takin' over

Love's takin over...

 Standing on the edge of a quay no lights flashing on the water for me
Fog in my mind darkens my eyes silently streaming for a distant sound
Ripple river yellows rising for a breath of breeding and drowns
Stillness overcomes me in the night listen to the rising water moan
I'm waiting, waiting for the night boat woo I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat
Shadows all through me shudder away echo me echo me (echo me)
Am I alone or is the river alive cause it echos me, echos me, echos me
I'm waiting, waiting for the night boat woo I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat
Waiting (waiting) waiting for the night boat woo I'm waiting (waiting)
Waiting for the night boat waiting for the night boat woo I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat I'm wating for the night boat




 You had plans all along
Must seen me coming down a mile above the ground
Because I am weak where you are strong
It's a thrill that makes me curious
Whatever I'm thinking of
You always seem to know
Because nothing is good enough
There's always something to keep me guessing
What if it's real, what if you're just faking?
What if you knew you could?
What if you get off on manipulating?
Why does it feel so good?
Driving the car turn up the sound
Gets ye head in a hailstorm, man I'm going to feel the blast
I pick you up - you throw me down
And it only gets more serious
What could you be thinking of?
You never let it show

Because you give me just enough
There's always something
You keep it coming
What if it's real, what if your just faking?
What if you knew you could?
What if you get off on manipulating?
Why does it feel so good?

Why do I want you more? Why do I want you? Why do I feel so torn?
Why do I want you more? Why do I want you?
Why do I want you more?
What could you be thinking of?
You never let it show


Why do I want you more? Why do I want you? Why do I want you more?




 You had plans all along

'Cos I am weak where you are strong
It's a thrill that makes me curious!
Whatever I'm thinking of

There's always something
To keep me guessing
Why does it feel right if you're just faking?
What if you knew you could?
What if you get up on manipulating?
Why does it feel so good?
Drive in the car
Turn up the sound
Gets your head in the ailes
Don't matter, gonna feel the blast
I pick you up, you throw me down

 Nice girls not one with a defect
Cellophane shrink-wrapped so correct
Red dogs under illegal legs
She looks so good that he gets down and begs

She is watching the detectives
Oh he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
When they shoot shoot shoot shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded cos he's got no heart

Long shot of that jumping sign
Visible shivers running down my spine
Cut the baby taking off her clothes
Close-up of the sign that says "we never close"
You snatch a tune, you match a cigarette
She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet
I don't know how much more of this I can take
She filing her finger nails
While they're dragging the lake

She is watching the detectives
Oh he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
Oh they shoot shoot shoot shoot
They beat him up until the teardrops start
But he can't be wounded
Cos he's got no heart

Now you think you're alone until you realize
You're in it
Ifear is here to stay love is here for a visit
They call it instant justice when it's past
The legal limit
Someone's scratching at the window. I wonder
Who is it?
The detectives come to check if you belong to
The parents
Who are ready to hear the worst about their
Daughter's disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

She is
She is watching, oh
Watching the detectives
She is watching the detectives
Oh, he's so cute
She is watching the detectives
Oh, as they shoot, shoot, shoot




 (LeBon, Rhodes, Taylor, Cuccurllo, Campbell)
Guess you know, where I wanna go
Got to see the water flow, try to understand
Got me trapped, playing with me like a cat
Scrape your fingers down my back, pin me to the ground
All along the water baby
Take me to your water baby
All along your water babe
(chorus)
I'll get by, can't you see I'm burning up
When you come and turn it up, higher every time
If I stay , Oh the end is near
Come and get me out of here, come and get me now
(chorus)
(chorus)
(Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohhh!)
Tell me is there any left?
I wanna drink it up
I'll drink it up
Baby, if there's any left
I'll drink it up, drink it up, drink it up!
(chorus)
(chorus)
Thirsty for your water baby
Spanning from your torture babe
Take me to your water baby
(chorus)
(Got me trapped)
Thirsty for your water baby
Sliding on your torso baby
Take me to your water baby
(chorus)
Thirsty for your water baby
Spanning from your torture babe
Take me to your water babe




 Time will see we're not searching for a wild excuse
To put emotions back on hold
Too much has gone down we know what you're doing
But do you feel the same way
You look sharp inside your pointed shoes
I have this picture hanging in my room
And I refuse to take you down or shake you down
We could bring you gently round if that's what you choose
For a point of view cause words like sand just get blown away
All those things we'd like to say

We need you 




 Any other day and you might have gone walking by
Without a second look
Any other way but I'm still mystified
I'm just trying to change my luck
Staring out the world and waiting for the one
But the world won't look away
The world does not explain

So, what are the chances?
We'll never know
If we take it for granted
A diamond explodes
What are the chances?

Playing with your life or is it destiny
Which sets you on a path
Is it out of choice that you're here next to me
Or just the aftermath
Of moments as they pass

So, what are the chances?
We'll never know
If we take it for granted
A diamond explodes
What are the chances?
We are lost in the flow
And looking for answers


So, what are the chances?
We'll never know
If we take it for granted
A diamond explodes
What are the chances?
We are lost in the flow
And looking for answers




 Child, don't you worry
It's enough you're growing up in such a hurry
Brings you down, the news they sell you
To put in your mind that all mankind is a failure

But nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow
We try not to show how frightened we are
If you let me - I'll protect you - however I can
You've got to believe it'll be alright in the end
You've got to believe it'll be alright again

Fighting because we're so close
There are times we punish those who we need the most
Though we can't wait for a saviour
Only got ourselves to blame for this behaviour


We've got to believe it'll be alright in the end
(Nobody knows)
You've got to believe it'll be alright my friend

 White! Ooh-white! White! Ooh-white!
(White Lines)
Vision dreams of passion
(Going through my mind)
And all the while I think of you
(Pipeline)
A very strange reaction
(Yours to unwind)
The more I see, the more I do

Something of a phenomenon
Telling your body to come along
Cause White Lines blow away
Blow! Rock! Blow!
Ticket to ride a white-line highway
Tell all your friends they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound for pound it costs more than gold
The longer you stay, the more you pay
My white lines go a long way
Either up your nose or through your vein
With nothing to gain except killing your brain

Freeze! (say rock, come on y'all)
Rock (say freeze, come on!)
Freeze! (say rock, come on y'all)
Rock (say freeze, come on!)
Freeze! (say rock, come on y'all)
Rock (say freeze, come on!)
Freeze! (say rock, come on y'all)
Rock (say freeze, come on!)
Aaaaah...
Higher baby, get higher baby, get higher baby
And don't ever come down... Free base!

Pipeline (pure as the driven snow)
Connected to my mind
(and now I'm having fun, baby!)
Highrise (it's getting kind of low)
Cause it makes you feel so nice
(I need some one on one, baby!)
Tell me it'll blow your mind away (baby)
Going to your little hideaway
Cause white lines (what do white lines do?)
Blow away
Blow! - Rock! - Blow!
A million magic crystals painted pure and white
A multi-million dollars almost overnight
Twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt
And if you get hooked baby
It's nobody else's fault - so don't do it!


(Don't you get too high)
Don't you get too high, baby
(It turns you on)
You really turn me on and on
(Can't you ever come down)
My temperature is rising
('Til the thrill is gone)
No, I don't want you to go
A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
He got out three years from now
Just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with twenty four kilos
He's out on bail, and out of jail
And that's the way it goes!

Cane! Sugar! Cane! Sugar! Cane!

Athletes reject it - governors correct it
Gangsters, punks, and smugglers are
Thoroughly respected
The money gets divided - the women get excited
Now I'm broke and it's no joke
It's hard as hell to fight it - don't buy it!

(White lines) Vision dreams of passion
(Blowing through my mind) And all the while I think of you

Something of a phenomenon
Tell your body to come along
'Cause white lines blow away

Ticket to ride the white line highway
Tell all your friends they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound for pound it costs more than gold
The longer you stay, the more you pay
My white lines go a long way
Either up your nose or to your vein
Nothing to gain except killing your brain

 I'm giving you the news
Your domination's through
You gave the best you've got
Now I'm out on top
If you're in any doubt
Listen to me
I've got a right to say
If you know what it's all about

Who do you think you are?

Don't want to be your enemy
If I'm not the one you want me to be
And I've got to do things the way that I do
Always trying to control me

Who do you think you are?

Our time on Earth is running through
(This is not a question of my pride)
Sometimes I think it's a game to you
(Ever wonder how I feel inside?)
And sometimes I play along
But man I've got a mind!
You've got to live with yourself
For the rest of you life
Do you understand?
Everybody asks themselves the question

Who do you think you are?

Why do you feel ashamed
When you can't explain the things I say
To other people
It's just occurred to me
A possibility
The thought that you might really want to be me?




 Wild boys, wild boys, wild boys
Wild boys
Wild! Boys!

The wild boys are calling
On their way back from the fire
In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell

They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again

 The trade's on
She drains emotion
To drink from her breast of fortune
Dreams have frozen crystal in the morning
Birth time rose;
A thorn for coronation
All arise from your rest
We will find enough there to feed you
Soon you'll belong to the blest
Spare us your lives while we need you

Loud is the music the crowd is bringing
Out of my head as the winter marches on
Loud is the music. The sky is ringing
Out of my head as the winter marches on. 
And on
Winter marches on

 You're thin ice
I should be on solid ground
An oh so quiet vice
I can hear that cracking sound
But i remain
Despite your deadly aim
To drive another lad insane
When you won't speak
My name

You kill me with silence that's your style girl you're letting me know
This deafening silence the only reason that you're in control (you're in control)
Its emotional violence i can't breathe now but i can't let go
You kill me with silence

True to life
Things are haunting up in here
If I had a knife
You could cut the atmosphere
Something else
I like this bed of nails
That's what I tell myself
Couldn't be much worse in hell

You kill me with silence that's your style girl your letting me know
This deafening silence
The only reason that you're in control (you're in control)
It's emotional violence I can't breathe now but I can't let go
You kill me with silence
You kill me with silence
Kill me with silence




 Zooming in
Stood on the line
You understand
I've been waiting forever
Come rain come shine
In the wind in the snow
In the filthy weather
You've got it all worked out
Yea but it knocks you out
But I'm zooming in
Now she arrives
In a flaming crash
Like a falling star
Heading straight for the dive
Going to make some cash
With the avatar

You got it all worked out
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Yea but it knocks you out
I'm zooming in on you on you

Don't look back you're a heart attack
You've got it all worked out
Yea but it knocks you out
We're not alone
In the 2nd life
There are millions like us
Right here
In the stones
In the air too bright
All the new insiders


Na na na na na na
I know you know
I don't want you to go
Na na na na na na
I'm zooming in and out on you
