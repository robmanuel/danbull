Every day you must say
So how do I feel about my life
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?
I am sick and I am dull
And I am plain
How dearly I'd love to get carried away
Oh but dreams have a knack of just not coming true
And time is against me now
Who and what to blame?
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?
For heaven's sake
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Every day you must say
How do I feel about the past
Others conquered love - but I ran
I sat in my room and I drew up a plan
But plans can fall through as so often they do
And time is against me now
And there's no one left to blame
Tell me when will you
When will you accept your life
The one that you hate
For anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Every day you must say
How do I feel about my shoes
They make me awkward and plain
How dearly I would love to kick with the fray
But I once had a dream and it never came true
And time is against me now
Time is against me now
And there's no one but yourself to blame
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
Anything is hard to find
For heaven's sake
Anything is hard to find
When you will not open your eyes
When will you accept yourself?
When?




 Oh hello
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
Hung by his pretty white neck
Some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
And I missed my bed
And I soon came home

They said:
"There's too much caffeine
In your bloodstream
And a lack of real spice
In your life"
I said:
"Leave me alone
Because I'm alright, dad
Surprised to still
Be on my own..."

Oh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the strain of the pain again
A rush and a push and the land that
We stand on is ours
It has been before
So it shall be again
And people who are uglier than you and I
They take what they need, and just leave

Oh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again
A rush and a push and the land that
We stand on is ours
It has been before
So why can't it be now?
And people who are weaker than you and I
They take what they want from life

Oh, but don't mention love
No - no, don't mention love!
A rush and a push and the land that
We stand on is ours
Your youth may be gone
But you're still a young man
So phone me, phone me, phone me
So phone me, phone me, phone me

Oh, I think I'm in love
Oh, I think I'm in love
Oh, I think I'm in love (think I'm in love)
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv
Oh...




 Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to
Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life you'd like to

So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no"
How could I?

Coyness is nice and coyness can stop you
From saying all the things in life you'd like to

So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no"
How could I?

Spending warm summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg

Ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me

Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together

Nature is a language - can't you read?
Nature is a language - can't you read?

So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me

Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together
If it's not love
Then it's the bomb
Then it's the bomb that will bring us together

So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me




 Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I'm tired and I
I want to go to bed
Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
And then leave me alone
Don't try to wake me in the morning
'Cause I will be gone

Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I will feel so glad to go

Sing me to sleep
Sing me to sleep
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore
Sing to me
Sing to me
I don't want to wake up
On my own anymore

Don't feel bad for me
I want you to know
Deep in the cell of my heart
I really want to go

There is another world
There is a better world
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well, there must be
Well ...
Bye bye
Bye bye
Bye ...




 I would rather not go
Back to the old house
I would rather not go
Back to the old house
There's too many bad memories
Too many memories there

When you cycled by
Here began all my dreams
The saddest thing I've ever seen
And you never knew
How much I really liked you
Because I never even told you
Oh, and I meant to
Are you still there or have you moved away ?
Or have you moved away?

I would love to go
Back to the old house
But I never will
I never will
I never will
I never will




 Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

A crack on the head is just what you get
Why? Because of who you are!
And a crack on the head is just what you get
Why? Because of what you are!
A crack on the head
Because of the things you said (things you said)
The things you did

Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand




 Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking, when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh... sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt (oh)

Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-daa
Bigmouth strikes again!
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh oh)
Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-daa
Bigmouth strikes again!
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh oh)

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her roman nose

 A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine

So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
Seems so unfair
I want to cry

You say: "'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn"
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well and I've heard them said
A hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take "on loan"
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall

You say: "'Ere long done do does did"
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
(Some dizzy whore, 1804)

A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
But you lose
'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine
Sure!




 Oh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn
Oh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn
Because there's somebody here

Who really really loves you
Oh Glenn
Stay home
Be bored
(It's crap, I know)
Tonight

Oh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn
Oh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn
Because there's somebody here

Who'll take a hatchet to your ear
The frustration it renders me
Hateful, oh...
Oh, don't come to the house tonight
Oh, don't come to the house tonight
Because you'll slip on the
Trail of all my sad remains
That's why, that's why
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love
Belch




 The death of a disco dancer
Well, it happens a lot 'round here
And if you think peace
Is a common goal
That goes to show
How little you know
The death of a disco dancer
Well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd rather not get involved
Oh...

Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
...But maybe in the next world

Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
...But maybe in the next world

Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice

Very nice
...But maybe in the next world

The death of a disco dancer
The death of a disco dancer

 Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul

I want to leave, you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the twenty-first century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history, Mr. Shankly
Fame, fame, fatal fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I'd rather be famous
Than righteous or holy, any day, any day, any day
But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of

Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul

Oh, I didn't realise that you wrote poetry
I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry, Mr. Shankly
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain in the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
Still, I must speak frankly, Mr. Shankly
Oh, give us money!




 Girl afraid
Where do his intentions lay?
Or does he even have any?
She says
"He never really looks at me
I give him every opportunity
In the room downstairs he sat and stared
In the room downstairs he sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again"

("I'll never make that mistake again...")
("I'll never make that mistake again...")

Boy afraid
Prudence never pays
And everything she wants costs money
"But she doesn't even like me
And I know because she said so
In the room downstairs she sat and stared
In the room downstairs she sat and stared
I'll never make that mistake again"




 Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's really serious

There were times when I could
Have "murdered" her
(but you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her)
No, I don't want to see her

Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Do you really think
She'll pull through?
Do...

Girlfriend in a coma, I know
I know - it's serious
My, my, my, my, my, my baby, goodbye

There were times when I could
Have "strangled" her
(but you know, I would hate
Anything to happen to her)
Would you please let me see her !

Do you really think
She'll pull through ?
Do you really think
She'll pull through ?
Do...

Let me whisper my last goodbyes
I know - it's serious




 Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh my darling
Why did you change?

Boy in a million, idol, a big star
I didn't tell you how great you were
I didn't grovel and scream
And rip your brand new jacket at the seams
You made a record, they liked your singing
All of a sudden the phone stops ringing
Ah, I never thought that you would let
The glory make you forget

Golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh my darling
Why did you change?

Top ten idol, king of your age
Who do you turn to when you're backstage?
Don't you remember you once knew a girl
You loved her more than the world
Is life always like this, brother?
Good for one side but bad for another
I must put you behind me tonight
Cause you belong to the lights

Those golden lights displaying your name
Golden lights it's a terrible shame
But oh my darling
Why did you change?
Oh, oh my darling
Why?
Why did you change?
Oh




 Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six long years on your trail
Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent six years on your trail
Six full years of my life on your trail

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y.W.C.A
I said "I like it here, can I stay?
I like it here, can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?"

She was left behind and sour
And she wrote to me equally dour
She said "In the days when you were hopelessly poor
I just liked you more"

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

Sixteen, clumsy and shy
I went to London and I
I booked myself in at the Y.W.C.A
I said "I like it here, can I stay?
I like it here, can I stay?
Do you have a vacancy for a back-scrubber?"

Call me morbid, call me pale
I've spent too long on your trail
Far too long chasing your tail

And if you have five seconds to spare
Then I'll tell you the story of my life

Sixteen, clumsy and shy - that's the story of my life
Sixteen, clumsy and shy: the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life, the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life
That's the story of my life




 Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
No, it's not like any other love
This one is different - because it's us
Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me

And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care
Kiss my shades...

Hand in glove
The good people laugh
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they'll never have
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they'll never have

And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care
Kiss my shades...

So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
For the good life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
Yes, I know my luck too well
And I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
Oh




 All the streets are crammed with things
Eager to be held
I know what hands are for
And I'd like to help myself
You ask me the time
But I sense something more
And I would like to give you
What I think you're asking for
You handsome devil
You handsome devil
Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say
I crack the whip
And you skip
But you deserve it
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it
A boy in the bush
Is worth two in the hand
I think I can help you get through your exams
Oh you handsome devil
Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say
I crack the whip
And you skip
But you deserve it
You deserve it, deserve it, deserve it
And when we're in your scholarly room
Who will swallow whom?
And when we're in your scholarly room
Who will swallow whom?
You handsome devil
Let me get my hands
On your mammary glands
And let me get your head
On the conjugal bed
I say, I say, I say
There's more to life than books you know
But not much more
There's more to life than books you know
But not much more
Not much more
Oh you handsome devil
Oh you handsome devil




 




 I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour
But heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life, why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?

Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I was looking for a job and then I found a job
And heaven knows I'm miserable now

In my life, oh why do I give valuable time
To people who don't care if I live or die?

What she asked of me at the end of the day
Caligula would have blushed
"Oh, you've been in the house too long", she said
And I naturally fled

In my life, why do I smile
At people who I'd much rather kick in the eye?

I was happy in the haze of a drunken hour

 Very old friend
Came by today
As he was telling everyone in town
Of all the love that he'd just found
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame)
Talked and talked
And I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
Prettiest green eyes anywhere
And Marie's the name (of his latest flame)
The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed
His money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is Famous
She is Funny
An engagement ring
Doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
A hideous trait (on her mother's side)
Then someone falls in love
Someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"
...Oh, walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout




 {Intro}

I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth
How can you say I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir of nothing in particular

You shut your mouth
How can you say I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does

There's a club, if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home and you cry and you want to die
When you say "it's gonna happen now"
When exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone

You shut your mouth
How can you say I go about things the wrong way?
I am human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does




 Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next
Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
Oh, but you will
For you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do
You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do

Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say:
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
"Oh, I don't want to go out tonight"
Oh, but you will
For you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now

Too freely on your lips
Words prematurely sad
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
Life is never kind
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight




 Hate, Love and War
Force emotions to the fore
But not for me of course, of course
I keep mine hidden
I keep mine hidden
But it's so easy for you
Because you let yours flail
Into public view
Yellow and green, a stumbling block
I'm a twenty-digit combination to unlock
With a past where to be touched
Meant to be mental
I KEEP MINE hidden
The lies are so easy for you
Because you let yours slide
Into public view
(Use your loaf!)




 Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Oh...

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me
The knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you

And I know it's over - still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over
Over and over, la...
I know it's over
And it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said:
"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know...
'Cause tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms..."

It's so easy to laugh
It's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh
It's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I, my love

Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head




 I left the North, I travelled South
I found a tiny house and I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can kick me
And you can punch me
And you can break my face
But you won't change the way I feel
Cause I love you

And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes (and you will change your mind)

I left the South, I travelled North
I got confused, I killed a horse
I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can punch me
And you can butt me
And you can break my spine
But you won't change the way I feel
Cause I love you

And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes (but you will change your mind)

I left the North again, I travelled South again
And I got confused, I killed a nun
I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
(I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell)

Why is the last mile the hardest mile?
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes
And I realised, I realised
I could never, I could never, never, never go back home again




 The lanes were silent
There was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
With a hard-faced
Three-word gesture

I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

And I doused another venture
With a gesture
That was... absolutely vile

I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

And now eighteen months' hard labour
Seems... fair enough

I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

Okay Stephen. Do that again




 On the day that your mentality
Decides to try to catch up with your biology
Come round

Cause I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face

On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face

A double bed and a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor
A double bed and a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor

And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over my face

A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on Prisoner's Aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
And it's written all over my face
Oh, these are the riches of the poor
These are the riches of the poor

And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face

On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology

And if you ever need self-validation
Just meet me in the alley by the Railway station
It's all over my face




 I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And ambition
The zeal I feel
This is my time

The note I wrote
As she read, she said
"Has the Perrier gone
Straight to my head
Or is life sick and cruel, instead?"
"Yes!"
No - no - no - no - no - no
No - no - no - no - no - no
Oh...

I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time

Life tends to come and go
That's okay
As long as you know
Life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know
Oh...

I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time

I want the freedom and I want the guile
I want the freedom and the guile
Oh, life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know
Oh...

I won't share you, no
I won't share you
I'll see you somewhere
I'll see you sometime
Darling...




 JEANE
The low-life has lost its appeal
And I'm tired of walking these streets
To a room with its cupboard bare
JEANE
I'm not sure what happiness means
But I look in your eyes
And I know that it isn't there
We tried, we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried
JEANE
There's ice on the sink where we bathe
So how can you call this a home
When you know it's a grave
But you still hope for ridding grace
As you tidy the place
But it will never be clean, JEANE
We tried, we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried
Cash on the nail
It's just a fairy tale
And I don't believe in magic anymore, JEANE
But I think you know
I really think you know
I think you know the truth
JEANE
No heavenly choir
Not for me and not for you
Because I think that you know
I really think you know
I think you know the truth
JEANE
That we tried and we failed
That we tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
We tried and we failed
Oh JEANE




 Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
So tell me how long
Before
The last one
And tell me how long
Before
The right one
This story is old
I know
But it goes on
This story is old
I know
But it goes on
It goes on
And on...
Goes on
Goes on




 Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train - Heave on to Euston
Do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

You left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see jealousy in the eyes
Of the ones who had to stay behind?
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?

You left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that "when he goes, he really goes"
And do you think you've made
The right decision this time?




 Very old friend
Came by today
As he was telling everyone in town
Of all the love that he'd just found
And marie's the name (of his latest flame)
Talked and talked
And i heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
Prettiest green eyes anywhere
And marie's the name (of his latest flame)
The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed
His money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is famous
She is funny
An engagement ring
Doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass (money), oh
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
A hideous trait (on her mother's side)
Then someone falls in love
Someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said : "how quickly would i die
If i jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said : "how quickly would i die
Oh, if i jumped from the top of the parachutes ?"
...oh, walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout




 Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is murder
And the calf that you carve with a smile
Is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
Is murder
Do you know how animals die?

Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murder
It's not natural, normal or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour of murder
No, no, no, it's murder
No, no, no, it's murder
Oh... and who hears when animals cry?




 




 So, goodbye
Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
It's not time
It's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And "love" is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once - twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once - twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means : I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
It means : I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?
...Whalley Range !
Into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her ...
I need advice, I need advice
I need advice, I need advice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
The world
I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh ...
I'm just a country-mile behind
The world
I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh ...
Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh...
Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh ...
I need advice, I need advice




 




 When you walk without ease
On these
Streets where you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
I never, I'm alone, and I
Never, ever oh ... had no one ever
Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude ...
Oh, Alone, I'm Alone, I'm Alone, I'm Alone
I'm Alone
I'm Alone
And I never, never ... oh ... had no one ever
I never had no one ever
I never had no, no one ever
Had no one never
Never ... no ...
Oh ..




 I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means (of slender means)
Each household appliance is like a new science in my town

And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean

And when a train goes by it's such a sad sound
It's such a sad thing

I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
Every sensible child will know what this means
The poor and the needy are selfish and greedy on her terms

And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean

And when a train goes by it's such a sad sound
It's such a sad thing

And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life and I think about death
And neither one particularly appeals to me

And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
In the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die




 




 At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
And oh, the plans they weave
And oh, the sickening greed
At the record company party
On their hands - a dead star
The sycophantic slags all say :
"I knew him first, and I knew him well"
Re-issue! Re-package! Re-package!
Re-evaluate the songs
Double-pack with a photograph
Extra track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
"Please them, please them!"
"Please them!"
(sadly, this was your life)
But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have said no
If you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
"Please them! Please then!"
(sadly this was your life)
But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have walked away
...Couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
You had no real way of knowing
In my heart I begged "Take me with you...
I don't care where you're going... "
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
Just a child from those ugly new houses
Who could never begin to know
Who could never really know
Oh...
Best of! Most of!
Satiate the need
Slip them into different sleeves!
Buy both, and feel deceived
Climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour! ("media whore")
"Please the Press in Belgium!"
(This was your life...)
And when it fails to recoup ?
Well, maybe:
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
You're just the same as I am
What makes most people feel happy
Leads us headlong into harm
So, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I danced my legs down to the knees
But me and my 'true love'
Will never meet again...
At the record company meeting
On their hands - at last! - A dead star !
But they can never taint you in my eyes
No, they can never touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you, my darling
They cannot touch you now
But me and my 'true love'
Will never meet again




 Panic on the streets of London
Panic on the streets of Birmingham
I wonder to myself...
Could life ever be sane again?
The Leeds side-streets that you slip down
I wonder to myself...

Hopes may rise on the Grasmere
But Honey Pie, you're not safe here
So you run down to the safety of the town
But there's panic on the streets of Carlisle
Dublin, Dundee, Humberside
I wonder to myself...

Burn down the disco
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music that they constantly play
It says nothing to me about my life
Hang the blessed DJ
Because the music they constantly play

On the Leeds side-streets that you slip down
Provincial towns you jog 'round

Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ, hang the DJ
Hang the DJ, hang the DJ




 Good times for a change
See, the luck I've had can make a good man turn bad
So please, please, please
Let me, let me, let me
Let me get what I want this time

Haven't had a dream in a long time
See, the life I've had can make a good man bad
So for once in my life let me get what I want
Lord knows, it would be the first time
Lord knows, it would be the first time




 Upon the sand, upon the bay
"There is a quick and easy way" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state
I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
Oh...

End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say "give in to lust
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
Soon be dust... "
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am

And sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
(Oh, really?)
Oh...

I could have been wild and I could have been free
But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate
Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith...

Oh...
Hand in glove...
The sun shines out of our behinds...
Oh...




 




 It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
You made him old

Reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Oh...

Fifteen minutes with you
Well, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were virtually dead
And they were so wrong
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, well, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were easily led
And they were half-right
Oh, they ... oh, they were half-right, oh

It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
It's time that the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
You made him old

Oh, reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Ah... oh...

Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
Oh, but I do
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
I do
Oh, I ... oh, I do
Oh ...

I dreamt about you last night
And I fell out of bed twice
You can pin and mount me like a butterfly
But "take me to the haven of your bed"
Was something that you never said
Two lumps, please
You're the bee's knees
But so am I

Oh, meet me at the fountain
Shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Oh ...

Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
Oh, but I do
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, no, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
I do
Oh, I ... I do...
Oh, I do...
Oh, I do...
Oh, I do...




 A sad fact widely known
The most impassionate song to a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown
But don't forget the songs that made you smile
And the songs that made you cry
When you lay in awe on the bedroom floor
And said "oh, oh, smother me mother"
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di la da da dey di

The passing of time and all of its crimes
Is making me sad again
The passing of time and all of its sickening crimes
Is making me sad again
But don't forget the songs that made you cry
And the songs that saved your life
Yes, you're older now and you're a clever swine
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you

The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
I'm here with the cause, I'm holding the torch
In the corner of your room (can you hear me?)
And when you're dancing and laughing and finally living
Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di, la da da dey di

Do you love me like you used to?
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di, la da da dey di
(You're clever)
(Everybody's clever nowadays)
(You're clever)
(Everybody's clever nowadays)
(You are sleeping - you do not want to believe)
(You are sleeping - you do not want to believe)
(You are sleeping - you do not want to believe)
(You are sleeping)




 Yeah !
What she says :
How come someone hasn't noticed
That I'm dead
And decided to bury me ?
God knows, I'm ready !
La-la-la ...
What she said was sad
But then, all the rejection she's had
To pretend to be happy
Could only be idiocy
La-la-la ...
What she said was not for the job or
Lover that she never had
No no no ...
What she read
All heady books
She'd sit and prophesise
(it took a tattooed boy from
Birkenhead
To really really open her eyes)

What she said :
I smoke because I'm hoping for an
Early death
And I need to cling to something !

 The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed and his money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is famous, she is funny
An engagement ring doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass (money)

And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)

And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator

So scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(This means you really love me)

(This means you really love me)

And though I walk home alone
I just might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

 Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your skinny body down, son"
But I'm going to meet the one I love
So please don't stand in my way
Because I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mamma, let me go

Young bones groan and the rocks below say
"Throw your white body down, son"
But I'm going to meet the one I love at last, at last, at last
I'm going to meet the one I love
No, Mamma, let me go

I thought that if you had an acoustic guitar
Then it meant that you were
A protest singer
Oh, I can smile about it now but at the time it was terrible
No, Mamma, let me go
No, no, no




 Is it wrong to want to live on your own?
No, it's not wrong, but I must know
How can someone so young sing words so sad?

Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear
And don't go home tonight
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you
The one that you love and who loves you (oh)

Is it wrong not to always be glad?
No, it's not wrong, but I must add
How can someone so young sing words so sad?

Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
Boot the grime of this world in the crotch, dear
And don't go home tonight
Come out and find the one that you love and who loves you
The one that you love and who loves you (oh)

Take my hand and off we stride
You're a girl and I'm a boy
Take my hand and off we stride
I'm a girl and you're a boy

Sheila take a, Sheila take a bow
Throw your homework onto the fire
Come out and find the one that you love
Come out and find the one you love




 Learn to love me, assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
My only weakness is- well, never mind, never mind, oh

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over

Learn to love me and assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow, and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
But last night the plans for a future war was all I saw on Channel Four

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over, hand it over, hand it over

A heartless hand on my shoulder - a push and it's over
Alabaster crashes down (six months is a long time)
Tried living in the real world instead of a shell
But before I began...
I was bored before I even began

Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Take over




 From the ice age to the dole age
There is but one concern
I have just discovered:

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girl's mothers are bigger than other girl's mothers
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

As Anthony said to Cleopatra
As he opened a crate of ale:
Oh I say

Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girl's mothers are bigger than other girl's mothers
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls are bigger than others
Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on
Send me the pillow
The one that you dream on
And I'll send you mine




 I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine, it owes me a living
But ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
Oh ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams

Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I don't know..

Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh am I still ill?

Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I don't know..

Ask me why and I'll die
Oh ask me why and I'll die
And if you must go to work tomorrow
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know because I've seen them
But not very often

Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh am I still ill?




 Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only
Slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never!
Who said I'd lied because I never?

I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen
And broke my knee
(and then he really laced into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied? - Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied? - Because I never
Oh, so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor...
... I drank more

Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
... Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love




 




 All the lies that you make up
What's at the back of your mind?
Oh, your face I can see
And it's desperately kind
But what's at the back of your mind?
Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay
And general decay
Nature must still find a way
So ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile impulses sway
This way and that way
This way, that way
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself

Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Let your puny body, lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down

As we lie, you say
Will the world end in the night time?
(I really don't know)
Or will the world end in the day time?
(I really don't know)
And is there any point ever having children?
Oh, I don't know
What I do know is we're here and it's now

So, stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you consciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait, oh




 Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
Oh John, you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights ?
Tonight will be your very last night
A woman said: "I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"
Hindley wakes and Hindley says:
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says:
"Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone"
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Hindley wakes and says:
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says:
"Oh, whatever he has done, I have done"
But this is no easy ride
For a child cries:
"Oh, find me... find me, nothing more
We are on a sullen misty moor
We may be dead and we may be gone
But we will be, we will be, we will be, right by your side
Until the day you die
This is no easy ride
We will haunt you when you laugh
Yes, you could say we're a team
You might sleep
You might sleep
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
Oh, you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!"
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh, find me, find me!
Find me!
I'll haunt you when you laugh
Oh, I'll haunt you when you laugh
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM!
Oh...
Over the moors, I'm on the moor
Oh, over the moor
Oh, the child is on the moor




 He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he said that he'd never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he swore that he'll never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)

Poor old man
He had an accident with a three-bar fire
But that's OK
Because he wasn't very happy anyway
Poor woman
Strangled in her very own bed as she read
But that's OK
Because she was old and she would have died anyway

Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never, never, never, never, never do it again
(not until the next time)

Jury, you've heard every word so before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes
I love you for you my love, you my love, you my love, you my love
Jury, you've heard every word but before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes?
I love you for you my love, you my love
I love you just for you my love

Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And in the midst of life we are in death, etc
Sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And in the midst of life we are in death, etc

Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Just will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me?
Jury will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me?
Will you find me?
How will you find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me?

Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera... Etcetera!
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Oh, oh




 Park the car at the side of the road
You should know time's tide will smother you
And I will too

When you laugh about people who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die
Well, I'm afraid it doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh

But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know

Kick them when they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down
When they fall down

It was dark as I drove the point home
And on cold leather seats
Well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my face after all

I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now it's happening in mine, happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine, happening in mine
Happening in mine, happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now, now, now it's happening in mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine




 The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies

A murderous desire for love
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever, they ever, believe me?
Oh...

The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies

A plundering desire for love
How can they see the love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live
How do you start?
Where do you go?
Who do you need to know?
Oh...
Oh no...
Oh...
La...




 Punctured bicycle
On a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
This charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
Ah! A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man
Ah! A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man
Ah! A jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

 Please don't cry
For the ghost and the storm outside
Will not invade this sacred shrine
Nor infiltrate your mind
My life down I shall lie
If the bogey-man should try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
To tease, torment, and tantalize
Wavering shadows loom
A piano plays in an empty room
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
And when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
For you are all that matters
And I'll love you to till the day I die
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Ceiling shadows shimmy by
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes
My life down I shall lie
Should restless spirits try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
I once had a child, and it saved my life
And I never even asked his name
I just looked into his wondrous eyes
And said: "Never never never again"
And all too soon I did return
Just like a moth to a flame
So rattle my bones all over the stones
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
Oh, see how words as old as sin
Fit me like a glove
I'm here and here I'll stay
Together we lie, together we pray
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Mine
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy
Although you're only three, sonny boy
You're - you're mine
And your mother she just never knew
Oh, your mother...
As long...as long...as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
As long... as long... as long as... as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
Oh...




 Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless swines
Cemented minds
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old suit since 1962
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck

I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up education
As a bad mistake

Mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
Knees you in the groin
Elbow in the face
Bruises bigger than dinner plates

I want to go home
I don't want to stay

Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old jokes since 1902
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck

I want to go home
I don't want to stay
Give up life
As a bad mistake

Please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
He grabs and devours
He kicks me in the showers
Kicks me in the showers
And he grabs and devours

I want to go home
I don't want to stay




 Oh! Take me back to dear old Blighty
Put me on the train for London Town
Take me anywhere
Drop me anywhere
Liverpool, Leeds or Birmingham
But I don't care
I should like to see

I don't bless them

Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say Charles don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your Mother's bridal veil?

And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were

So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said: "Eh, I know you, and you cannot sing"
I said: "that's nothing - you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you are tied to your mother's apron
No-one talks about castration

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
(These are the things that kill me)
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
(These are the things that kill me)
All their lies about makeup and long hair, are still there

Passed the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonely




 




 Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore

Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car
Oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home and I'm welcome no more

And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought oh God, my chance has come at last
But then a strange fear gripped me and I just couldn't ask

Take me out tonight
Oh take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, oh, I haven't got one

And if a double-decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten-tonne truck kills the both of us
To die by your side, well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine

There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out




 My eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wonderkind
You took me behind a disused railway line
And said "I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known"
And you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

These things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stept

I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill, and you were not wrong

But I can't believe you'd ever care
And so you never care

These things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stept

Oh the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your room
They meant more to me than any
Than any living thing on earth
They had more worth
Than any living thing on earth, on earth, on earth
Ohhh ohhhh
Vivid and in your prime
You will leave me behind
You will leave me behind

 In a river the color of lead
Immerse the baby's head
Wrap her up in the News Of The World
Dump her on a doorstep, girl
This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again
You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five
Oh, he said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will

Oh, save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad

A shoeless child on a swing
Reminds you of your own again
She took away your troubles
Oh, but then again
She left pain

Ohhhhhh, please save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad
Oh oh
Ohhhh
Oh la la
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad
Oh oh
Ohhhhh
Oh la la
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad




 I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Cause you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
And some may say
When usually it's Nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?

I say "No, I'm gonna kill my dog"
And "May the lines sag, may the lines sag heavy and deep tonight"

I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
Cause you're evil
And you lie
And if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(But I won't cry)
Loved and lost
And some may say
When usually it's Nothing
Surely you're happy
It should be this way?

I said "No"
And then I shot myself
So, drink, drink, drink
And be ill tonight

From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
From the one you left behind
Behind
Behind
Behind
Behind
Behind
Behind
Oh, unhappy birthday
Behind
Behind

 I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
Message received loud and clear, loud and clear
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
Oh, message received loud and clear, loud and clear
Message received
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

I wear black on the outside cause black is how I feel on the inside
I wear black on the outside cause black is how I feel on the inside
And if I seem a little strange, well, that's because I am
And if I seem a little strange, well, that's because I am
But I know that you would like me if only you could see me, if only you could meet me
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours




 I was minding my business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
To set my eyes on the blistering sight

Of a Vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

A scanty bit of a thing
With a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose
As Rose collects the money in a canister
Who comes sliding down the bannister?

A vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

The monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again
My God!
The Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh...
The Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh...

The next day in the pulpit
With freedom and ease
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again and again and again

In the fabric of a tutu
Any man could get used to
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign




 Well I wonder
"Do you hear me when you sleep?"
I hoarsely cry
(Why?)
Well I wonder
Do you see me when we pass?
I half die
(Why?)

Please keep me in mind
Please keep me in mind

Gasping - but somehow still alive
This is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping, dying - but somehow still alive
This is the final stand of all I am

Please keep me in mind

And I wonder
And I wonder
Please keep me in mind
Ohhh keep me in mind
Keep me in mind




 All men have secrets and here is mine
So let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I think I can rely on you...
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you

So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none
But now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight

The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why?
Because you asked me to!
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh

So, what difference does it make?
So, what difference does it make?
It makes none
But now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight

Oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole, and then I lied
Just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well, I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
But no more apologies
No more, no more apologies
Oh, I'm too tired
I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you, oh-ho-oh
Oh, my sacred one...
Oh...

 Oh, the nights are too long
When the questions are long
I tried, but I will never understand
What Do You See In Him ?
What Do You See In Him ?
Oh ...
She's the lifeblood of me
As you walk hand in hand
And I try, and I try, and I try
But I will never understand
Oh, What Do You See In Him ?
I ask myself :-
What Do You See In Him ?
Oh ...
But she will plague you and I will be glad
Yes, she will plague you and I will be glad
Oh ...
Oh ...




 What she said
"How come someone hasn't noticed that I'm dead
And decided to bury me? God knows, I'm ready!"

What she said was sad
But then, all the rejection she's had
To pretend to be happy could only be idiocy

What she said
Was not for the job or lover that she never had

What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
(It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really really open her eyes)
What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
(It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead

What she said
"I smoke 'cos I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something!"

 "Um... this song was written by... erm, erm..."
What would you sell?
Loose glasses and suit
Heart and soul
Won't wear out
That's not enough!
I wonder what's inside
Fish fillet knife
Can cut
Right through my eye...
I'm looking for some words
To call my own
Worn-out phrases
And a hand-me-down
They'll knock me
Under where I stand
Sad on his back
In a corned beef pan
Going under
You can feel them pulling me down
To the rust inside...
This is the way...
Franken-star is born
Bits and pieces
Others have worn
All held together by a management glue
Too much glue
Watch the stars turn blue
Turn blue
Turn blue
Turn blue
Turn blue
I'm going under
You can feel them pulling me down
To the halls of rust
Eeh...
I, I, I, I, I...
Thankyou...




 The rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down
Oh the rain falls hard on a humdrum town
This town has dragged you down
And everybody's got to live their life
And God knows I've got to live mine
God knows I've got to live mine

William, William it was really nothing
William, William it was really nothing
It was your life

How can you stay with a fat girl who'll say, ohhh
"Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring"?
She doesn't care about anything
"Would you like to marry me?
And if you like you can buy the ring"
I don't dream about anyone
Except myself

William, William it was really nothing
William, William




 Here her head, she lay
Until she'd rise and say
"I'm starved of mirth,Let's go and trip a dwarf"
Oh, what to be done with her?
Oh, what to be done with her?
Ice water for blood
With neither heart or spine
And then just
To pass time; let us go and rob the blind
What to be done with her?
I ask myself
What to be said of her?
But when she calls me, I do not walk, I run
Oh, when she calls, I do not walk, I run




 Loving you is driving me crazy
People say that you were born lazy
'Cause you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
So change your life
There is so much I know
That you can do
Come and see...
Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you
If you stay
I'll stay right beside you
And my love
May help to remind you
To forget that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
I don't need
A house that's a showplace
I just feel
That we're going no place
While you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
So change your life
There is so much I know
You can do
Come and see...
Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you
If you stay
I'll stay right beside you
And my love
Might help to remind you
To forget that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
Oh...
I don't need
A house that's a showplace
I just feel
That we're going no place
While you say that
Work Is A Four-Letter Word
So change your life
There is so much I know
That you can do
Please come and see...
Wide-awake
And take all of this love
That is waiting for you




 If you're wondering why
All the love that you long for eludes you
And people are rude and cruel to you
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must suffer and cry for a longer time
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
And I'm telling you now

If you're wondering why
When all I wanted from life was to be famous
I have tried for so long, it's all gone wrong
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
But you wouldn't believe me

You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must suffer and cry for a longer time
You just haven't earned it yet, Baby
And I'm telling you now

I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
Today I am remembering the time
When they pulled me back
And held me down
And looked me in the eyes and said

You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You just haven't earned it, my son
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
You must stay on your own for slightly longer
You just haven't earned it yet baby
And I'm telling you now

You just haven't earned it yet, baby (oh, oh)
You just haven't earned it yet, baby (oh, oh)




 As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
Back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose

But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
Because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say... oh
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh...
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen... oh...
In the back of your car

A friendship sadly lost?
Well this is true...and yet, it's false
Oh...
But did I ever tell you, by the way?
I never did like your face

But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life

No, I've never had a job
Because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say... oh
Oh...
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh...

But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied... oh... to the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
Oh...
