There's funny stuff happening in the Arklay mountains
Far fetched but when you see the proof you can hardly doubt it
People acting animalistic
Cannibalistic
Bravo team went in with a bag of ballistics and now they're missing
Now alpha team need to find them and to bring them back
Good job we brought some sniffer dogs
Oh no we're being attacked
Crap they want to eat us
A tactical retreat into this mansion
Will prevent us all from landing up as meat
Now we can meet the team
Barry, Chris, Wesker, and Jill
Whos destiny's to fulfill a plethora of exceptional kills
It's best to be the best of the best in the business
Because there's resident undead and your head's on their hit list
Sick hominy grits
This zombie's a bitch
And he kinda looks like the ex head of Abercrombie and Fitch
We've lost communications
Contact the letting agent
This mansion's in urgent need of heavy renovation
Bits of lead are penetrating every wall i'm facing
I see through the heavy rain into Umbrella Corporation
They're creating a mutagenic agent named T-virus
I see, that explains the stage displays of Miley Cyrus
We mustn't let it spread and affect the rest of us
Nobody wants that
Except evidently Wesker does
He's treacherous
Messed with us
The complex is set to bust
We'd best get the bus
Before the blast combusts our flesh to dust

And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

Now rewind twenty four hours in time
So we can see what alpha team was sent into the deepest night to find
Bravo team left the chopper crash site
To get on with their proper pastime
Pretty much like last time
Let me introduce Rebecca Chambers
A chick who steps on trains
Regardless of whether she's in hecka danger
Seems she bought the wrong ticket
This could be a long trip
But where she's going, she's got a cell mate
A convict
Billy Coen
It's like con air but on rails
Smashing barriers like record day one sales
Strong gales fail to derail their aim from it's target
To unveil and excavate the fate of James Marcus
From train rides to strange tidings sane minds
Can take down an umbrella under daylight
From train rides to strange tidings sane minds
Can take down an umbrella under daylight

And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

Two months have passed after the blast
And from the debris zombies are free
Lucky we brung in a rookie from the police
Enter Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield
A rare pair whose enemies will be left with heads peeled
This is not a nightmare, Claire, it's dead real
And the remedy's a red hot shot of lead
Pew!
This lady played along
Her name is Ada Wong
She came to take the G-virus
And her infiltration game is strong
But it's in the hands of an urchin called Sherry Birkin
Who's under threat of hurting from every enemy lurking
So it's time to make a break and face her great big dad
Take a train away to safety and escape the flaming lab

And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

Elsewhere in the hell of Raccoon City
Jill Valentine's back for a task that's not to pretty
She's here to prove the conspiracy regarding Umbrella
But it's too late, she needs to escape with Carlos Oliviera
They wrangle with foes and the most vicious of attacks
And untangle a plan to blow the city off the map
And whenever there's a terrorist
Better get off of the premises
Ever so quick
No menace is relentless as Nemesis is
God damn, this is hella cocked up
Where the hell's the helicopter?
Get a flare up in the air
A better fare just went and rocked up
Hop in
Who the hell's that hairy fellow dwelling in the cockpit
Now watch the bomb hit and demolish the metropolis

And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

Now after all the commotion
Leon was forwarded for a promotion
To withdraw the daughter of POTUS
From the claws of an occult cult over the ocean
At home in Europa
And I can only assume soon their bones will be broken
Hmm, that's strange
Now either we've played the wrong track
Or we may have got our facts wrong
And now Ada Wong's back
She's playing the game like ong-bak
On a recovery mission
To retrieve a plague
That'll leave you needing the recovery position
A vicious parasite know as Plaga
Used as a recruitment tool by Los Illuminados
Leon gets the virus like the toolbar on a crap browser
And at the same time he has to fight his mate Jack Krauser
On a secret island where they find a device
To defeat the virus like the most minor of lice
Until surprise surprise
A final violent fight
A tyrant dies
They ski and see the island's fiery demise

And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

Flash to Chris Redfield, five years after that
He met Sheva Alomar on dispatch to Africa
She went back to tackle disasters
That happened in the aftermath
Of Umbrella's dastardly plans
Sacrificial lambs
Tasked with apprehending
A man to prevent a bio-organic weapon
From hitting the black market and spreading
They head in ever deeper
This region's like hell
No surprise Wesker's scheming behind the scenes at Tricell
He and Excella are keen to accelerate the dissemination
Of a cellular agent with the aim of complete devastation
Chris and Sheva kill Excella
Deal with Wesker
Then escape in a helicopter
They couldn't have did it better

And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

Resident Evil 6
Is an action-adventure third-person shooter video game
Developed and published by Capcom
That is all I wish to say about Resident Evil 6 at this point in time
Thank you




 Yeah, it's Illmatic, yeah
(It's Bullmatic, actually)
It's Illmatic, yeah
(It's Bull- it's Bullmatic, I just couldn't find-)
It's Illmatic, huh
(I just couldn't find a proper instrumental
Without him t-talking over the-)

One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, whatever (It is Bullmatic, though)
One time for your mind, one time
Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme
(Yoink! Queue-jumping)

I'm picking a quite good rap, on top of a quite good track
Being quite good at rap, I'm quite good at that
Plug in your headphones and listen to the stereo
I'm navigating neurons in your head through heavy flows
A sonic hemorrhage, have you got a beverage?
It's thirsty work being such a bloody clever kid
I like inventing mental raps, some things I never did
Like pushing Richey Edwards head-first off the Severn Bridge
Melanin deficient, the sun gives me much redder skin
Than the stereotypically depicted Native American
I burn so easily that I'm banned in the EEC
For health and safety reasons, being tanned's an unachievable dream
People would scream and see my peely skin
And being a bit obese, I wish that I was really thin
But the lifestyle I've picked doesn't allow for it
Too much curry, whiskey, I can't even make my trousers fit
I'm proud of it

One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
I sound clever
Hey yo, Nas? Fuck that, man, that shit was fat
But kick that for them gangsters man, fuck all that
(Ah! Language.)

I'm a rowdy Brit, once I've had a drink or three
When someone says the word 'prick', I think of me
I don't like myself so I forget it with drink
Until I'm retching up my breakfast with my head in the sink
I've fallen off the wagon, poppin' down the pub with Adam
Calling Jack up, knocking back Jack until I'm fucking lagging
I could be spending my time on reinventing my life
But have you tried Strawberry Kopparberg, it's ever so nice
Open up wide, it's medicine time
Except I've lost my wallet now and that's the end of the line
Can't even get a kebab, can't even get in a cab
Looks like I'm trekking it back at the end of the night, shite
Heavy drinker, heavy thinker; bevvy sinker
Wake up with a headache laying in bed next to a sweaty minger
Why do I do it to myself, I could be saving cash
Rather than wasting it behaving like a blatant ass
It takes me back to Monday Club with Jack at Hog's Head
Inhaling flaming gas chambers, knock'em back and drop dead
Nowadays I keep my ass clean and keep to caffeine
Twaty Dan with glass in hand, that man's a has-been
I blow raspberries in his general direction
He could've been spending time investing in his next profession
So there's a lesson: time is valuable and finite
Work hard and play hard but get the dividing line right
If I had tried to write till all my rhymes were tight
I wouldn't just rely on tired similes to blow me up like dynamite

One time for your mind, one time
I sound clever
One time for your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time for your mind, one time
Yo, from ninety-two to ninety-nine

From ninety-two to ninety-nine
I know what you mean, Nas
The golden years!
When David Collier was Chairman of Luton Town




 When gamers came along, the planet laughed at us
But this is gaming in the future and you haven't heard the last of us
Dismissing this is just an enormous fallacy
So open your mind, and let it alter your reality

Hey geeks
I bring a message from the future
There's a new revolution heading to computers
It's '73, but it won't be too long
'Til we can get the TV to play a game of Pong
But it's time to breakout of the house
The crazy days of Space Invaders await us
Arcade potatoes
Swap the shooting range
For computer games
Arcade renaissance
Pre-8-bit's blooming days
A new decade
Welcome to the 80's
Pac-Man's the latest new craze
Q*Bert's the rage
The first personal computers let loose
As Manic Miner grabs your time, and to fight is truly useless
Elite gave legions of wee little boys
A deep space region and freedom of choice
Now here comes the console
The first one sold portended an industry of dimensions untold
The birth of franchise
Mario Brothers
Donkey Kong, Monty Mole, I'd tell you the others
But, the list would go on and on
Longer than I can tell
Until the 90's when the game became handheld
Meanwhile. I bought stories of another time
And point-and-click arrived from the shores of Monkey Island
Ever want to see your chums beat right up?
Well, Daniel-san, you need to try Street Fighter
A tournament with all your buddies in your front room
Is all good until you fight online on Doom
Hijack your mind, your momma can't abide this
Night Trap might lack morals, it's a moral crisis
What are we doing to our youth?
They're shooting people
Glued to screens with superglue
Computers need to be banned when the laws broke
Ban Manhunt
Ban Grand Theft Auto
Try something musical, but if you have a sore throat
I have what you're after
Parappa the Rapper
Tomb Raider, the tune invades your brain
Get in her way and she'll make you taste the pain
A sports a game always and it's hard fact
Then a game became a sport and its name was Starcraft
Kids used to play with dolls and a house
The Sims is the same, but controlled with a mouse
Open worlds abound, but rarely 3D, hey
Until the Elder Scrolls and GTA
Wait 'til you see the scale of the monsters and bosses
That you face in Shadow of the Colossus
Things are getting bigger, more decisions, more maps
Millions of simultaneous players in Warcraft
All the people
So many people
See, your whole family can get involved in Wii Sports
And more people means more money, more flair
For big blockbusters
COD: Modern Warfare
Even more people, more freedom, more Indie games
Limbo, Fez, Super Meat Boy, Braid
Revolutionizing gameplay
A mind blast
Constructing infinite destructible worlds
Minecraft
Gaming on the telephone, yes I know it sounds absurd
Fruit Ninja, Farmville, Angry Birds

 Alright, fellas
Ladies
I'm not actually Australian
As you can probably guess
But uh, grew up watching a lot of Crocodile Dundee
Neighbors
And I'm gonna have a bit of fun with this one

I started with nothing
They took it all
Swapped it for a sunburn
And a foot in the balls
I'm homeless and hopeless
These bogans are bogus
Emotionally deprived
And rife with psychosis
They've gone and made max ferocious
How mad this bloke is
That'll stab you in the back
With a broken bone
And slash your scrotum
I need to have the focus
To build the Magnum Opus
And plan a road trip
So that I can go and tackle Scrotus
He scrapped my black on black
And that's a bloody ballache
Messing with another fella's car?
Not on at all, mate
Never miss a war boy
He's one foot in the grave
When I twist the blade
Never forget the look on their face
Look, I'm not brave
I just want to repay the pain
I ain't saving the world
There's no world to save

I'm Mad Max
Collect scrap
To attach to my ride
And drive the threat back
I'm Mad Max
I've left tracks
From Gas Town way out
To the outback
I'm Mad Max
I blast caps from blas cap
And splatter the barren flats
With flak
I'm Mad Max
I wreck tracks
And make you crapp your kecks
Like ex-lax

Just nipping out to nick stuff
And then get stuck in big nothing
But get stuffed
If you think that I'll quit, huffing
Unsettle the dust
Above the speckles of rust
I've got myself to help
There's no one better to trust until
I bumped into Chumbucket
Through plum luck
And it got me pumped up
To have a chum who's up for
Mucking in
Tucking in
Trucking
Kicking up a motherfucking ruckus
Sick enough to sit in
While I'm socking these suckers
When we hop in the vehicle
I call shotgun
That's not a metaphor, mate
I've actually got one


I've got a ticket to ride
To where the fittest survive
To live here requires
A particular type
Of meticulous mind
You need volition
Munition and intuition to drive
And that's what griffa provides
It's not ufficient to be wishful
And blag it
You need the nads
To eat a fistful of maggots
From prickles to scrapulance
Rippers and rammers
You're going to need to be a dab hand
With a wrench and a hammer
The manic mechanic instilling panic
Bringing havoc
To these panoramic lands
With my rampant antics
Though it's dramatic
I'm a classic romantic at heart
Hi honey, I'm home
You won't believe the traffic


You guys are so nice
Australia




 That's funky

I am a bit of a difficult hypocritical prick
Who'll always get into a pickle, but the sins I commit
Are all above board; this is for everyone I've got love for
Who helped me up through the window by the shut doors
Pulled strings, untangled the web, and cut cords
And if you didn't assist this, then up yours
My business is to give hits to kids
That have been amiss from the industry hit list
This flow's for those who were bullied in school
You'll grow to show those tools that they don't rule
This is for those who are bullies in school
You'll realise you can be nice and fully cool
Some of us look back at that as the worst days
Others still suffer that exact crap in the workplace
From virgins that never had a first date
To unwanted babies that never had a birthday
This is for single moms, working three jobs
To keep your sprog in the Reeboks that he wants
This rap's for single dads, fighting to see their kids
Crying, thinking if they even understand he exists
Here's some acknowledgement

I've set the controls for the heart and the soul
Of those whose woes have hardly been told
Too many hearts of gold are treated like pyrite
So it's high time I tried to set this bias right
Feeling low? My lines'll leave your hopes high as kites
Incite delight like a cherry bright sky at night
This vocal's for locals who are frightened in their neighbourhood
Refrain from leaving home at night; afraid of violent raping muggers
For the same buggers doing crime to pay for drugs
It never meant to end this way, you're stuck; pain sucks
Change looks like something that'll never happen
But if I let that thinking win, I'd never end up rapping
For those in prison, those who did and those who didn't
The victims that they did it to and those who witnessed it
For those who overcome their hopeless bitterness to show forgiveness
Whether you do or don't is no-one's business
For those who wish to string them up until they know their miseries
Life's a winding hillside road and the slope is slippy
For the people upon the picket lines
Miners who down their pick and strike
Strive for a different life
For the silent majority
Tightening your waistline to prop up an economy
You probably hadn't a problem with til the bottom dropped off of it
But now you're picking up the tab and haven't got a tip

This is for the elderly, sitting in their chairs alone
Or bedridden in a bug ridden nursing home
A verse devoted to you, and who you truly are
The same you that you've ever been, I've seen you shoot for the stars
But gravity ravages things savagely
So let my lyrics lift your spirits up from incapacity
Cause I'm the captain of this flagship actually
And you're a VIP invited to fly the galaxy with me
This is for the carers, looking after another
I understand you want to be more than just a mother
How can you have a lover, or any other life
If you couldn't find someone else to come and grab the cover?
Changing a duvet's much easier with two, hey?
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
For those stuck at home, chronic illness, health problems
A lot of guilt makes you want to kill yourself often
What little help I can offer to soften the blow?
Can't invent anything off of the top of the dome
But you've not been forgotten and I just want you to know
Wherever you are, my flow will boldly go
I swear by the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost
Jehovah, Allah, Muhammad, whoever holds the most
Control over the souls of the unappreciated
It will keep ebbing away every day that people play this shit

I try to recognise
Those who've been left aside
Come aboard my enterprise, and boldly...
I try to recognise
Those who've been left aside
Come aboard my enterprise, and boldly...




 When you're old and run down, what happens when you die?
Not your soul but the dust and the ashes and the like
After that time you've passed on and they're scattered and they lie
Under the grass in a casket for time
Until the last of your atoms has gone back to the matter
That it had been a part of when the planet was gas dust
At the instant you're officially a corpse
This list of sick things begins kicking in with force
The tempature of your body's inner core falls
And this event is called algor mortis
It's thought this happens cos your pulse has flattened
So it halts the passage of the warmth and that
But if you thought that that was a nauseous fact
Then I ought to inform you what also happens
The muscles in your ass pack up and relax
So that all of that crap just stacks up in your pants
Your blood runs back under the gravitational pull
Then thickens and begins to coagulate plus
Skin pallid, limbs all stiff
This is called rigor mortis
When you die
Don't even bother thinking about floating to heaven
When you die
You won't burn in hell but you might roast in an oven
When you die
Don't even bother thinking of eternal paradise
When you die
You'll just be fertilising grass in this so-called afterlife
After twenty-four hours or so
You actually eventually swell up and bloat
The gases inside you can't come out so they only
Keep amassing 'til you're either really fat or explode
But don't laugh, cos I mean it, that isn't a joke
It'll happen to the Queen and the average bloke
Bacteria starts devouring both
Flesh and fat from your anatomy, out of your clothes
Then it's down to the crows to come down and carry on
Lunch out on carrion down to the bone
Now you should know that even bones decompose
If you leave them over an aeon or so
There will be no trace of your dead corpse
You'll be feeding potatoes and absorbed
Dug up and eaten off a plate with salad raw
I'm sorry to say I'm afraid that's the law
Actions have reactions so it has to stop
Every man since Adam's travelled back to the cosmos
Rock to iron to steel and back to rust
Ash to ash and dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
When you die
Don't even bother thinking about floating to heaven
When you die
You won't burn in hell but you might roast in an oven
When you die
Don't even bother thinking of eternal paradise
When you die
You'll just be fertilising grass in this so-called afterlife

This is a transmission from Amanda Ripley McLaren
I'm stranded in a ship that is barren
But it is apparent
That there's a visitor with the viciousest plan
And I'm a fish in a barrel
This isn't a Christmas Carol
But if you could tell me
Just what the dickens was happening
And what this is that I'm tackling
I'd be pretty thankful
Lights flickering
Life trickling
Through the cracks in the corridor floors
Is quite sickening
No time for dithering, babbling
Impotent panicking
The impetus will drag us kicking and scrabbling
Into the blackness
I need my wits about me
This bleeding bitch has found me!
Come to think of it
I really shouldn't spit so loudly
Whoops!

This is survival of the fittest
Survival of the vicious
Survival of the wickedest and sickest
This is survival of the fittest
Survival of the vicious
Survival of the wickedest and sickest
This is survival of the fittest
Survival of the vicious
Survival of the wickedest and sickest
This is survival of the fittest
Survival of the vicious
Survival of the WICKEDEST...

Continued transmission from Amanda Ripley Mclaren
The more I witness the madness
The more that it is apparent (hah)
What evil hazardous demon hell is this?
Is it a lucid dream of a weak, cardaverous human being
With sleep paralysis?
I'm none too keen to feed the ravenous beastly savages
With creepy phalluses
Creeping round the ship
'Til my radar's beeping vanishes
Nothing seems as loud as my breathing pattern is
The teeniest sound could be the catalyst
For the last battle of wills
Between me and evil manifest
As I wander through the corridor
The horrid gore conjures all the awful thing I've done I'm sorry for
I'm not an omnivore
But I was one before the food chain collapsed
I saw my colleagues' innards on the floor!
But bring it if this ugly motherfucker wants some more!
You're just one deformed ponce with a pompadour!

This is survival of the fittest
Survival of the vicious
Survival of the wickedest and sickest
This is survival of the fittest
Survival of the vicious
Survival of the wickedest and sickest
This is survival of the fittest
Survival of the vicious
Survival of the wickedest and sickest
This is survival of the fittest
Survival of the vicious
Survival of the WICKEDEST...
In space, nobody can hear you scream
In space, nobody can hear you scream
In space, nobody can hear you scream
In space, nobody can hear you scream

In space... Scream all you like...




 I'm the biggest prick in this town
The British Chris Brown
Visit your award ceremony
And just sit down
I'll slash your tire just cause I enjoy the hiss sound
Disagree with this, my sleeves'll slip down
Fists out, swingin' 'till the 56th round
I could beat you with my wrists bound
Ha
I list my inspirations in roughly this order:
Father Christmas, Satan, and Chris Dorner
I'm spreading disorder
I diss all the rappers who I asked to collaborate and got a missed call off
Rap's Piers Morgan
But with a pierced organ
Too much information?
Too bad, that's the beer talking
I sit too near broads
And make them feel awkward
Randy as Ramsay
Now cook me a meal, Gordon
Now here's the point where you might think
"Why's he still talking? Slimey limey
Why should I see the appeal of him?"
And that's the point
I travel through the camera
And slap you 'till you're black and blue, Rihanna
Alicia Keys needs to improve her grammar
I'll take a hammer to her new piano
Now you've had a glimpse inside the ill mind of Dan Bull
Try to get out, I doubt you will find the handle
My lines are angle grinders
They mangle rhymers
I rap into the sky
And the air force scrambles fighters
Spit fire
You stink like a lit tire
I'll bring you down to the ground
Quick as a zip wire
Listen to this: My dick is thick and it's large
So get onto Twitter and tell Nicki Minaj
America's gone shit since you had Britain in charge
And fuck off if you think that's a little bit harsh
I'll stick a petard up in your doors of perception
Snipping the wires, no phone call for protection
I get dressed in my Sunday best
And I still look less fresh than Kanye West
So, give me the hand lotion
And phone Frank Ocean
I want to know his exact man-to-man quotient
I'm loopy, that's limey for "so loco"
I run and rub my crotch upon an old hobo
Whilst shouting over my shoulder "No homo!"
Because fuck it, you know, "YOLO!"
Righty ho, that's Drake's act copied
Who am I body bagging next, A$AP Rocky?
I suppose I could, but I ain't that cocky
I've already had two chains snatched off me
It's time for payback, probably
I pack a nine-inch winky, they attract totty
And occasionally, I may strap shotties
But usually I'll do a drive-by screwface at posses
Sneeze and leave the seats of my Maybach snotty
Green windows looking like they're made of stained glass, Gothic
I'm a misanthropic proper maniac, potty
I got crunk off a straight black coffee
It was a bad idea to take that straitjacket off me
You just don't have the power to restrain that, Scotty
I rap with an ill mind, "Hey, that's Hoppy!"
I'll tear his fucking face off, take that, Robbie!
Your production quality is way bad, sloppy
Or is your wave compression rate that lossy?
"How can Hopsin be the one that he's dissing?"
I'm just showing I can do this and still win the competition




 America, America
Here's to your health
America, America

Now tell me
Why's the country that's the most wealthy also amongst the most unhealthy?
There's probably a lot of theories out there
But mine's got to be the lack of national healthcare -
A category of welfare that happens to be well fair
Whether there's wealth there or whether it's elsewhere
Now you can probably tell where this is going from my accent
Or you're thinking "Why's this British guy rapping?"
I like America, the music, the people
That's why I want to see improvements to each of them
There's problems here too, Britain's got its fair share
I'm sure you know about our questionable dental care
But there's one thing that stands better than the rest
And that's the NHS, yes
Where nobody faces rejection
Just because to treat them would be a dangerous investment
Where what the doctor prescribes is what you're given
Instead of having to wait for your insurer's decision
Where prescriptions are a reasonable price
If you need something lifelong you can even subscribe
Where if you're old or young; unemployed;
Then it's free, and the price tag becomes null and void
Where you can go home without paying one penny;
Where you've still got the option of a private company
It's unbelievable the stuff they've done for me before
Months in hospital and I've not paid a fee at all

America, America
Here's to your health
America, America
Here's wishing you good health

Insurance firms are about saving dimes
Before they'll even think about saving lives
So say goodbye to your treatment if there's even
A minor loophole in your legal agreement
Is your system victim free?
There's fifty million Americans who evidently disagree
Fifty million without health insurance
That could die just because they couldn't afford it
You don't have to pay to have a fire extinguished
And you have the police, not private militias
So why should this difference apply to the systems
Providing for victims requiring assistance?
Nothing should be held higher than citizens
Putting wealth over health? I am sick of it
Insurance firms are commercial businesses -
They're not concerned what your physical fitness is
They're only interested in what the interest is;
Over here we have a different incentive
A lot of you are incensed at this
And I don't intned to be insensitive but listen
There's several myths about the terrible British
Medical system that I better dismiss, quick:
1. You can't choose who your doctor is. Not true -
There's a long list of doctors I've gone to
2. One of the most stupid lies is that
Old people are euthanised when they're due to die
Not true - if there was institutionalised
Granny killing don't you think there'd be a public outcry?
You don't have to use the NHS anyway -
There's still plenty of private firms if you want to pay
But the proof's in the pudding, come to Britain for a bit
I bet you can't find anyone who would get rid of it


America, America




 An eagle soars as the people fall
However, he ignores
All your feeble wars
He will steal a horse
Speed the steed across
Clean between your forces
And beat them all
In a free-for-all
These scenes of gore
Are nothing but another bit of heathen lore
From Florentine streets to Venetian waters
The whispers persist of a secret order
And whether or not you believe, it's all good
Either way I'll proceed; keep wreaking trauma
You're never making Connor fall
I never honour laws
When I'm on a warpath
My tomahawk's
Always responsible
For an onslaught
Of monstrous proportions
You're a goner, fool
Done for
Humans I hunt for
Dropping through the roof
Never knocking on the front door
What, you want more?
Or do you want war?
I've been around for longer
Than Rob Faulkner
And now I'm gonna
Run up on a futhamucking armed gunner
Pull a Stone Cold Stunner
And I've done a runner
Quicker than a bullet from a gun
And once again I'm under cover
Repping for the Brotherhood
Stepping like no other could
Uppercutting any threats
I never take another look

I'm an assassin
One with a passion
For innovative rapping
Dropping so fast
You're probably having
A problem to follow the captions
Said I'm an assassin
One with a passion
For innovative rapping
Dropping so fast
You're probably having
A problem to follow the captions

I combat colonialism
While owning a rhythm
I know the world doesn't owe me a living
So throw me a bone
And I'll cause pandemonium with it
Ignoring Newtonian physics
Forget opprobrium
Critics'll go with baloney below
To the same place I take fakes
Phoneys and mimics
No need for gimmicks
Cynics only need a mo with my lyrics
Do you need me to explain that
I'm lyrically spraying it
Sharper than the tip of any bayonet
I pack a hidden blade and I make you lay on it
Whether minutemen or redcoats
It'll only take a minute at the very most
'til they're both dead, ghosts
I dead both
Behead foes
'til stocks and shares in lead rose
From Boston to New York
Soul of an eagle
Aloft in a true hawk
And as I move through the frontier
The truth becomes clear
The future calls, I'm done here
Almost
I've just got another little task
And I won't tell
If you don't ask
Because




 And the Songbird sings...
(It's Infinite)

This is for the voices who are unheard
Who never back-talked one word to the Songbird
This is for the second class citizens, and prisoners locked alone
I bring a list of things the Prophet wants you not to know
I've got to blow the propaganda out the box and so
Open up the rift and put this disc into your Voxophone
I'll take your brain to places it doesn't often go
So brace yourself for take off and watch the show
I'm properly known as Booker DeWitt
And I've had enough of this shit
Fed up of being stuck in a rut
So I'm looking to rough up a couple of pricks
And accomplish a mission to look for a woman imprisoned and stuck in a city where something's amiss
Like the rhythm the government's drumming to whip the anger of the people
Daily handling the stress
While I've just ambled in from gambling and landed in a mess
And I'm telling ya, Elizabeth isn't a damsel in distress
She's the damn best wingman to ever don a dress
To be honest, we've loads of things
In common, we both can bring an opening
We're probably closer twins
Than Robert and Rosalind
I throw my grapple and aim
To blow the back of your brain out
And contemplate on why we play those irrational games
My main foe is Zachary Hale Comstock
The day his reign begun, a fundamental bomb dropped
Columbia's on lockdown
Every day they're destroying somebody, so what now?
Send for Daisy Fitzroy
The rich get fatter, while the slums are getting hungrier
It's a matter of time before they pull the rug from under you
We'll make your money disappear from you like a conjurer
And overthrow the fundies that are plundering Columbia


So, I know this is absurd and sounds bananas
But have you observed the way they worship founding fathers?
That's why the Vox Populi have hurtled out the darkness
Emerged, about to start to turn around and clout this heartlessness
If this disc is flying, you'll be dying like you're Hyacinth
Hirelings or higher things
Vox Populi's guys or Jeremiah Fink's
If they pile in on me, then they're receive undying violence
I'll lynch the pious kings with the silent wire strings
From the tiny violins that won't be crying when they're lying singed
Ignite the tinder, set the sky alight in flights of cinders
And let freedom ring inside your cries like the singer
That's like trying to hide your violent injuries, as if they're minor things, by keeping just a tiny thimble on your finger
One hand holds Vigors
The other pulls triggers
I'm a multi-tasking action man with a glass full of malt liquor
Salt licker
Rapture's contraptions are fantastic
But don't exist yet, so that is how we pack Plasmids
No need to hack gadgets
The manner in which I battle a Handyman is akin to black magic
My life's a play where every act's tragic




 I'm awkward, can't talk to anyone
I fall at the first hurdle, it hurts to get it wrong
My mind's wired a different way to everyone else
So I might seem strange, and be left on the shelf begging for help
Placed in a position in which I'm desperate now
Ashamed of my condition when I'm meant be be proud
It'd be great to fit in and blend with the crowd
Without a red face, a sense of dread; I'm trembling now
I like things a certain way, a pre-determined order
And it disturbs my thoughts if the certain order's changed
Uncertainty unnerves me, close the curtains over the windows
It's a curse, Asperger Syndrome

We ought to stick around
Be autistic and proud
We ought to stick around
We ought to stick

I don't notice faces in open places
My focus phases out and goes to blazes
And an overloaded brain is no way to be social and say hello to mates, is it?
It's made me feel alone for ages
Because I know there's no hope to change it
To most a face is an open page -to me it's closed, the prose erased
And how am I supposed to behave
When nobody's taken a moment to show me the way? But it's OK
I still hope and pray the status quo can change
And I still scope the skies waiting for blokes in capes
And I'll fly when I know how I'm supposed to behave
So won't you take a moment to show me the way


Autism assisted me in becoming a poet
Because I feel deeply but I just struggle to show it
I care for those around me though I don't know how I'm supposed to tell people
So I wrote it down, prepared my vocal sound
Then shared my opus on open ground
Those with this syndrome are endowed with a determination to succeed
That the non-Asperger brain often fails to achieve
And yet we go off the rails easily, but believe me
I've seen what we can be when we've got dreams to reach that no-one else can
And piece by piece the diagnosed'll find the folks to help them
To aspire to the heights their sights are focused on
I know it's a long fight but we're the type to go the whole hog




 Ha! So the Joker's locked away in the asylum
Me thinks things are gonna become quite violent
I believe, he slipped a trick inside his sleeve
And his desire to leave is nonexistant 'til he's played a game malicious hide and seek
With sticks and dynamite and tnt
But what's that silhouette that you can see?
In the half-light to the dark night you might just find the dark knight
Savage as a shark bite, to the other rappers who can't just quite do this
You see the truth is I leap from roof with a really ruthless steez
I leave you toothless please you silly doofus
I'll give you a Chinese burn, and I don't mean confusius dead inside a little urn
I'll twist your arm until the skin is rather irritated
My methods of torture are really unsophisticated, to the most complicated machinations
To mash your face in, with patterned lacerations that are fascinating
And as my grapple hangs my batarang'll batter gangs
I brang the thang to make you say this can't be happenstance
The blackest avalanche, and as Dan's an anagram of "and"
I'll crick your spine and leave twisted like an ampersand
Feeling squiffy like you're getting high in Amsterdam, the neon city light'll emphasise the fact your damned

NANANANANANANANA
BATMAN BATMAN!

If commissioner Gordon didn't ignore the dissonant warnings
Than it'd have surely been a different story all together for the better
The prisoners all lead a sinister life a criminal orgy
Living inside a wicked and vile despicable isle, sicker than bile
But it's evident I'm a vigilant militant
Willing to kill them with brilliant diligent skill and the guile of a killer with infinite style
Jack White is quite insane, and while I'm fighting Bane, I find a titan-like strain flowing rife inside his veins
It's the same the Joker's trying to synthesise in doses high as planes
I'm tired of games, It's time for change, to time to take is smile away, Hey
How long has Killer Croc been a cock?
My trap'll leave him reeling like a spinning top and I willn't stop until his locked up in a box
Sit and watch me fighting pound for pound with Poison Ivy, a vigilante plant antidote without my boys behind me
Horticulture's not the sort of culture to be taken lightly
I take an eighth of titan now I'm feeling slightly hyphy
I might be quite that as high that I can see inside me psyche
Me, I'm so fly that I can fly, crikey

NANANANANANANANA
BATMAN BATMAN!




 We travel back in time
Back to that divine land
Enshrined in annals
Where the faction of Assassins rise
The ballads tell a tale of a man
Who has defined the ages
With the way that he slays and raps in rapid rhymes
I'll take that brainwave back
From digital age to eight track
Face facts
These ace raps
Hit like straight backs hit haystacks
So you may say I'm laid back
I'll claim that
But my aim's making every place mapped
While I chase fame and take payback
Who says today's doomsday?
Crusades are a new age
You may lose faith
Soon as I swoop waving two blades
When an eagle soars
Lethal claws
Cease all thoughts
Of the people caught
I've seen the way that evil talks
They lead the way and the sheep'll walk

I am part of the Brotherhood
Finding the Ark of the Covenant
Take pride in my art and I'm loving it
Fighting the guards
With a couple of knives in the dark
Under cover of night
As I hide from the light
And then strike in the heart of the government
The provider of suffering
Buffering
Buffering
Leave no time for recovering
I am part of the Brotherhood
Finding the Ark of the Covenant
Take pride in my art and I'm loving it
Fighting the guards
With a couple of knives in the dark
Under cover of night
As I hide from the light
And then strike in the heart of the government
The provider of suffering
Buffering
Buffering
Leave no time for recovering

Red hidden blade
Dead giveaway
Neck split in twain
That didn't change
The nectar of the Apple of Eden's forever forbidden taste
I'm an avenger
On an adventure
Honour's essential
Follow my mentor
Though I'm not looking for scuffles
I'm going to be getting in one with the Templars
Every era's under an empire
That's under impression that they'll ascend higher
Than their ascendants they're effectively lent by
A memory sent via genetically linked wires to the future
Accessed through hacking hereditary cues through a computer
Animus rendering surroundings
As I just blend in with the crowd
I'm going to pretend my hood's a cowl
And then get out of town
Without a sound
So stealthy now
I prowl around the realm
Until I'm out of bounds
Grabbing a flag
That I'll add to the bag
Full of everything else I found

I am part of the Brotherhood
Finding the Ark of the Covenant
Take pride in my art and I'm loving it
Fighting the guards
With a couple of knives in the dark
Under cover of night
As I hide from the light
And then strike in the heart of the government
The provider of suffering
Buffering
Buffering
Leave no time for recovering

Armageddon Altaïr?
I'm a getting out of here
Armageddon Altaïr?
I'm a getting out of here




 Call it parkour but hardcore
I make killing an art form
Death's cold taste
Sweet as carte d'or
No need to start wars
For a difference of opinion
Give me the name of your antagonist
I'll stick them in the ribs
Because I'm an assassin
One with a passion
For innovative rapping
Dropping so fast
You're probably having
A problem to follow the captions
I'm so ahead of my time I'm probably rapping backwards
A scholar of Latin
With a master's in dispatching
Anybody that's hassling
One of my customers
I cuts them up
And shuts them up
In a casket
What you've got to do is ask
And then I'll have grabbed them
And then stabbed them
In the abdomen that minute
And be finished with the killing
Before you've finished with asking!
A bird of prey
With terminator's murder rate
I'm serving plates of pain up
Like a perverse buffet
I'll take you to the pearly gates
I'll impersonate a passer-by;
You wouldn't bat an eye
Until your circulations pacified
So practiced I couldn't
Count the crimes
I've perpetrated
How many spines
Or vertebrates
I've snapped
My raps travel through sound and time
Reverberate
Through generations
Permeate
My serenade regurgitated
Through a nerd rapper's recitation
To your earthly playlist
So I'd say this was a revelation
A revelation




 I've said it before
And I'm ready to tell it again
In my lowest moments
I'm my own best friend
I want to connect
With the people around me
The people that doubt me
But being in a loud scene
With the crowd screaming around me
Is totally overwhelming
To the point where I feel I'm drowning
The sea ond the fear surround me
The cheers are bringing me down deep
But now the crowning glory
Is how the crowd applaud me
Applause resounding all around
The sound is out of the ordinary
Kind of like my personality
'til I learned it wasn't a tragedy
These mannerisms and Danielisms
Are things that make me actually me
An atom within the matter
That's spanning the seas
And planets and galaxies
And that isn't an allegory
We're all composed of energy
And it means
The planet's a can of beans
With infinite different varieties
So why are me and V seen
As a difficult bit of society?
Nah, fuck that
We're the facets in the diamond
While you're on the mountain shouting
You can't see the fact we're climbing

Me
I'm living with autism
And all the world's a stage
For which I never auditioned
Me
I'm living with autism
My brain plays a syncopated
Change of pace to your rhythm
I'm living with autism
And these bars formed the cells
Of my mental prison
'til I saw I didn't need to be forgiven
For being me
And living with autism




 I've found a way out
I've found a way out
A way out of this hell
A way out of this hell
But I can't do it myself
Can't do it all myself
I need a little help
I need a little help
But I've found a way out

Oh howdy, hey y'all
We were about to tell a tale
Of how to get out of jail
Without bail and without fail
No doubt they'll try to follow our trail
So we'll throw them off the smell
Scale mountains and vales
Down roofs and wells
And escape town, raise hell
Quite an incredible story
Two detestable criminals jetted in glory
But you were skeptical towards me
Almost ignored me, really you warned me
Stay away
But I have a daughter
And a father's love is something really strong
Her being far is like fish that's out of water
So I proved that I could be a worthy partner
I scrutinise the new arrivals
To find a suitable sidekick
Who'll survive and who will thrive
If I supervise them through the life
We do inside this human binding zoo
That's grinding you to piles of used detritus
Until a new life is to do or die for
I'm down, damn, don't you understand?
No slack like a racked rubber band
You can stop looking for your other man
We're a team on the way to motherland
And when we're done we can part ways
From this parley, eat a parfait
On the parkway or the pathway
But we can't do this halfway, can we?
I don't want to be behind bars
I want to sleep in five star hotels
And drive cars
Low life with a kind heart
So I'll be right behind you when the fight starts
I'll strike guards
When a couple of die hards combine smarts
It's like "What?"
Whatever it takes
Sever and break
Anybody who would tether our fate
We're doing this now
Hell if I wait
I don't have the time, I'm not in the state
Of mind, I'm putting my trust and my faith
In your plan, I hope I'm not making mistakes
We're seeing this through and scraping the plate
We're breaking our chains and storming the gate
Trust in my decision
Mission: Busting out of prision
Hidden, sussing out the system
Bring the cooking out the kitchen
Cuss each other out like brothers
Busting raps on rhythms
Ay, didn't your mother ever think
To teach you how to listen?
She did, I'm glad I listened to you
This prison is something we're wriggling through
No witnesses, wit and just riveting coup
Positioning us, from vision of you
This is our run, this is our chance
Opportunity for us to advance
I'm taking the reins and taking a stance
We're taking a risk, let's hope that it stands
The penal system sucks
We need to steal a pickup truck
And leave for freedom
Police we leave them in the dust
'cause we could give a fu...
We all have reasons to keep breathing
Even if it means thieving
People we keep dear and need to see them
These are deep feelings

I've found a way out
I've found a way out
A way out of this hell
A way out of this hell
But I can't do it myself
Can't do it all myself
I need a little help
I need a little help
But I've found a way out




 Iden Versio
Iden Versio
I done a verse, yo, I done a verse, yo
I done a verse for Iden Versio
They've only gone and blown the Death Star to smithereens
As if it was hill of beans
But we won't give up easily
Remnants of a galactic empire
Back to send fire
Enact revenge for absent friends
Defend their pride and then die
A death the heavens sent for us
We're meant to avenge the emperor
With relentless lust to see the rebellion crushed
To pieces of debris and dust

Don't get it back to front
'Cause after that you're done
Galactic action, stunts
Massive guns that pack a punch
So grab your blaster, pack your lunch
Run and jump back to the battlefront
Don't get it back to front
'Cause after that you're done
Galactic action, stunts
Massive guns that pack a punch
So grab your blaster, pack your lunch
Run and jump back to the battlefront

When the empire's my employer
Then I get to ride in a Star Destroyer
Loyal to the path of the dark
But apart from that, no morals
Like a lawyer
Don't just stand there, startled voyeur
Avoiding a fight? I'll start it for ya
Oh yeah
I will send an inferno
Burn your final breath
You'll find no women, you'll find no men
Finer than I, or Kylo Ren
So why pretend any different
When I don't give a who I offend
Get in a fight with Iden then
I will pen you a violent end
Send my guys to find your friends
With an identical plight for them
Hit hyperspace, this sight's amazing
It's like a maze of lit light for days
Sky's ablaze, ship's sides are quaking
Just like the bass, this time we're taking
This fight and chasing at lightning pace
Give the dice a shake, six, strike the base
Woop, my mistake, hit your hiding place
You better find another quick, right away

Don't get it back to front
'Cause after that you're done
Galactic action, stunts
Massive guns that pack a punch
So grab your blaster, pack your lunch
Run and jump back to the battlefront
Don't get it back to front
'Cause after that you're done
Galactic action, stunts
Massive guns that pack a punch
So grab your blaster, pack your lunch
Run and jump back to the battlefront

End these rebels who were striking the Death Star
Then we'll find where the rest are
Never rest 'til it's bedtime
Crying "Get off the Xbox"
And they're like "Yes, ma"
That wasn't my best line
That wasn't my best bar by far
I've kept the best for the end part
Giving you a headstart, oh, you'll need it
The dark side wants your soul to feed it
Assaulting Theed and leave it molten, beaten
Halt and heed the alarm call
These daft fools wanna start?
Cool
I'm a glass always half full kind of arsehole
Harsh, cruel
So these bastards wanna play hard ball
I bring sharp tools
And a lot of fuel for my TIE Fighter
Fly, hi guys, want to carpool?
And can I ask y'all:
Why does Admiral Ackbar talk
Like Ja Rule went to art school
And then got taught fuck all
Come and fight Darth Maul
In a dark hall, while sparks fall
Like Ponda Baba's arm in a bar brawl
That's hardcore
That's Star Wars

Don't get it back to front
'Cause after that you're done
Galactic action, stunts
Massive guns that pack a punch
So grab your blaster, pack your lunch
Run and jump back to the battlefront
Don't get it back to front
'Cause after that you're done
Galactic action, stunts
Massive guns that pack a punch
So grab your blaster, pack your lunch
Run and jump back to the battlefront




 Hello, Pandora fans
I'd like to show my awesome plans
Hold on tight to your organs; glands
We're riding back to the Borderlands
When I hear that Gearbox
Are releasing a sequel, my teardrops
Are uncontrollable
I'm inconsolable, but fear not
They're tears of joy, like me as a boy
After Christmas eve when I see a box
I open it up and say "whoa" at the view
It's only overflowing with loot
Locking and loading, I know what to do
Now who am I going to shoot?
You, you're a pitiful prick
So I'm ripping you up with a critical hit
Funds improve my guns and loot
I'll use it if it'll fit
If it moves I'll shoot it, you tit
I'm a Buzzard, you're a blue tit
I fly in the sky and it's fatal
Foes are lying disabled
A hole in their face; I'm reminded of bagels
I'm ever so slightly unstable
Me? I'm hardly an angel
Leave that to the Guardian Angel
This is the eighties, I'm Arnie
And painfully making your army unfaithful
Health and safety; watch your head
Heavy metal; lots of lead
But before I drop you dead
I'll shred you up like Dr. Zed
I said "Zed, let him in"
Led Zeppelin
Never played on David Letterman
Though that may be irrelevant
Nevertheless it's a hell of method of making it evident
Dan is the cleverest rapper
To ever use gaming in tracks
Setting a precedent that wouldn't ever be bettered
Til weapons are made into raps
Eighty seven bazillion guns
A similar number of brilliant puns
Turn that to cash, gimme the funds
Back to back with my militant chums
I'm blasting stacks of straps at prats
It's action packed ridiculous fun
If kills were calories, that'd be fattening
Fragging a skag and I'm bagging and tagging him
Having you lagging and manically panicking
Man, is it actually happening?
Well, I'm an assassin assassining you
So if that is a fact then it has to be true
You're chatting Claptrap
So I should grab your nadsack and yank it
So your nads are dropping
Like the stock is on the NASDAQ
Asshat, don't answer back
Who the fack is Handsome Jack?
You want how many grams of that?
I'll grind you like my ganja sack
I will be having you crying in agony
Violently cracking your violin; Paganini
Meeny miny mo
More money, less problems
The bigger the gun, the less nonsense
I'm less Mark Ronson, more Charles Bronson
Or a vault Hunter S. Thompson




 Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger
Badger, Badger
Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger
Badger, Badger, Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Me, I'm a badger appreciator
So I don't appreciate when I see these haters
In a heated debate, hating on my fuzzy buddies
These fuddy-duddies' behaviour is bloody cruddy
The countryside's where I reside
And I'll fight mindless violence, inside it with pride
It's not a fair fight at all
One side's got fur, the other fire rifles
I should approach those marksmen and ask them
Why they're sneaking 'round in the dark
Grown-arsed men
It's a little too late to be jogging
And this is a well-known spot for dogging
Oh, you're not dogging?
You're just shooting, maiming and killing
Thousands upon thousand of small woodland animals
Under the cover of darkness
Scrubbing their congealed blood from under your fingernails
Then going home to kiss your wives and children?
That's alright then, for a minute, I thought you were dogging

So here's what I suggest: end the madness (NOW!)
Cause some of my best friends are badgers
Here's what I suggest: end the madness (NOW!)
Cause some of my best friends are badgers
Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger
Some of my best friends are badgers
Badger, Badger, Badger, Badger
(Keep them badgers alive!)

Moley, Toad and Rat went on a walk
Rat-a-tat-tapped on Badger's front door
But they never got an answer
Cause Mr. Badger is now just a sad little corpse
God dayum
Kenneth Grahame would be spinning in his grave
If we didn't try to save them
It's like a modern day Salem
When witches switched for the badgers
Ridiculous madness
When I take a woodland ramble
I'm glad to see such a fantastic natural menagerie
So to eradicate a fraction of it nastily
Really leaves me quite anxious, actually
It's meant to prevent cow TB
But the ISG see things a little differently
Still the goverment's pushing it diffidently
So you and me need to give them an epiphany
It won't stop bovine tuberculosis
And I'm pretty certain you know this

So many Brians...




 The Kid awoke in bed, with a dopey head
Filled with a smokey blend of inner hope and dread
But he's not hung over yet, still has his sanity
But tragically, the land that he inhabits has been damaged deeply
The ravage wreaked with savagery would leave him
Wishing he had had a dream but sadly this is real: the Calamity
Brutality against humanity, depravity
Dang, he'll need a little more than bandage for this malady
Disaster has the people abandoning morality
It's a little too late to handle diplomatically
The situation thus demands a different strategy
A mission that'll leave you battling with gravity
Brandishing battering rams
Calamity Cannons with hammers and fangs
From Mancer to Langston and Zand
There ain't a more masterful rapper than Dan
The man that's ransacking your ranch olives?
I'm not going to be passing the branch
You're only fuelling my fire
And I've got gas in the tank

Drank a Black Tonic
Sampled the track and rapped on it
I've been to the brink
And the Bastion's coming back from it
Drank a Black Tonic
Sampled the track and rapped on it
I've been to the brink
And the Bastion's coming back from it

Oi
I visit the Shrine, hit the Distillery
Stock up on Spirits and Wine, liquid artillery
Then I hit a Windbag with such a vicious impact
That I split the very atoms that keep him intact
Think back
To who knows where, you're going to get
Pimp slapped
If you don't care
I'll aim the Breaker's Bow straight at your face
And break your nasal bone (nose)
The Stranger throws flaming flows
And vocal flame bellows
It's the way it goes, terrain shaking from the Cael blows
While I'm shooting guys, neutralise the threat that they'll pose
And we had ought to take the Galleon Mortar from the sailboats
Before the floor crumbles away like so much stale toast
Thrust a Brusher's Pike, right in the bushes like:
"Have we not met before? You must have a lookalike"
Kid's just another guy following a call to action
He'd give up his life for the Bastion
I...


We're coming back...
We're coming back now
You don't need to play a new game, trust
Just boot up New Game Plus
You don't need to play a new game, trust
Just boot up New Game Plus
We're coming back now




 What's Dan Bull doing?
Why ain't he rapping?
Cause I feel like it
Deal with it, bitch

I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come just to rattle your bones
I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
Let's go grab the
Grab the, cattle by the horns
Roll like a stone, like a stone

You motherfuckers feel the fat fuzzy humbuckers
Drums pump you full of dumdums
You're dumbstruck
Flashing you out when we bunch up and bum rush
Swinging guns at you like they're fricking nunchucks
We're crude, lewd and rude
We leave you nude
In a puddle of blood
It's enough to make your mum blush
You've got a big gun?
Well I've got a bigger one
If you want to live another minute brother, better run
We could have been anything that we wanted to be
But all we wanted to be was this predominantly
Do nothing moderately
So don't be bothering me
Cause currently I'm swallowing a bottle of beam

Born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
Let's go, grab the
Grab the cattle by the horns
Roll like a stone, like a stone

Five fives is twenty five
That's twenty five motherfuckers want you dead or alive
Twenty five fives is a hundred twenty five
But a hundred twenty fives is two thousand five hundred

I'm in the place
Bombing the base
Running up with a gun in your face
Let me cut to the chase
I come at a pace
Similar to somebody running a race
Nothing'd faze me
My aim's keen
With a laser beam
To cut a long story short I'm crazy

I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
Let's go, grab the
Grab the cattle by the horns
Roll like a stone, like a stone




 Look at my dog tag! You'll see D.BULL a heavy hitter from the midlands like led zep have reformed
I don't need the marine corps, I'm lethal, from 3,000 miles off the eastern seaboard
Colder than trebor mints, Nee Naw, K People step away from the keyboard
I wanna see your heads bopping see saw, up and down so speedy you're reeling from the G-Force
Give me a vehicle, a BMD or Super Hornet, troops are falling uniform superiors are fearful
I'm really tearful, saline solution, slides from my eyes at the same time I'm shooting
So maybe I just should let a Beretta do the talking, cos after all you're a dead man walking
I walk in pull out my M1014 and end all these porkies, and tall stories, with the ease of a nuclear attack
I shout "LOOK BEHIND YOU" and shoot you in the back, suited up with flakjackets, flashbanging
Leaving claymores in your path, need i say more?

This is the Battlefield
Where if you lack the skill, than your cap'll peel back
Like an apple peal, Twat

If you lack the skill, than your cap'll peel
Like an apple peal, So grab the steel

You're a super soaker, I'm a super cobra, souping up my guns 'till I become a supernova
I'll take you to the moon and over like a lunar rover, I got a new limo and so are you the chauffeur?
I'm a human Yoda, No, a new Jehovah, I do my flows with the devotion of a Jew to Kosher
So I shot the charcuter and do him over, I'll do to you've what you seen me do to sopa
I'll straight flush you like a full suit in poker and mutilate you leaving you like you're doing yoga
Resume control assume the role of Henry "Black" Blackburn, I'm coming for your guts like a freaking flatworm
Soon as your back's turn Blackburn'll blast murder fast, I'm packing more heat than a massive Thermostat
I've got a certain knack to turn the gas and hurl a match so if you'd prefer lack a burn than stand further back
And slap bureaucrats that I haven't heard the facts, I'm rapping more original, than a fricking Werther's Pack
I mix hardcore, nerdcore commercial rap and stay on top of the beef like a burger bap
I'm a soldier but not the sort to traverse Iraq, I'll come first in any match on 30 racks of server stacks
I serve a purpose that you might find confusing, Dicing right through the digital illusion of the

 Battlefield 1, Infinite Warfare
It's time to prove yourselves
In lyrical combat
Proceed

Oh
You made another game with space marines
What next, lightsabres and laser beams?
We're keeping it classic
Bogart
You're too busy romancing a robot
These trenches are dark
Stark
We're setting a benchmark
That sets us apart
You're set in your ways
We're setting alarms
If you dice with death
Then expect to get harmed
Our mixtape drops like mustard gas
Yours doesn't even cut the mustard
Pass
Bruv, you're gonna get rushed and bashed
Crushed and thwacked
With clubs and bats
Dragged back to the bunker and slumped in a lump
Your days are numbered
Past
World War One killing further plans
You might have like Franz Ferdinand
What you got?

Our game, it's called CoD
If you don't like it, you are odd
It is such a good game
That it comes with another game

You imitate
We intimidate
We're inundated with praise
Does it irritate?
You dream it
We been and did it, mate
We innovate
Move
You're in the way
We're infinitely bored
Of Infinity Ward
We saw your fans filing for a divorce
While infinite be poor
People instantly warm to this
It's indicative we're in for the awards
We predict that your income'll be falling
Like a wall
'Til it's infinitely small
See you impotently crawl
Like an infant, so be warned:
There's grown men crying at the incident report
We're indiscriminate
It is insignificant
If anyone is innocent
We're killing you
With implements and instruments
It's no coincidence
That we're considered infamous

Your game's old
No one likes
Old stuff
Such as old bikes
With big wheels
They aren't good
Your game must be made of wood

We're killing on sight
Better hold on tight when I drop by
Godlike
I'm turning CoD to a bombsite
Plus I leave a tough guy tongue tied
Fighting frostbite
Blind in the foglight
It's not the size of the dog in the fight
It's the size of the fight in the dog in the dogfight
You're getting hit in the chin
I'm sitting and sipping a gin
Give it a minute, you'll be giving in
When I'm giving a kicking and killing Infinity Ward
So ghastly and gory
Pro Patria Mori
I'm a flowing Wilfred Owen
Oh, and you've just been killed with a poem
A Seven Nation Army couldn't hold me back

Your game sucks
Ours does not
Yours is cold
Ours is hot
Sigh, ok
I'll drop the act
Oh god, please stop
I don't wanna get sacked




 I’ll nuke the New Conglomerate
I’m a Super-Don with it
Apocalyptic popping clips like Chewing Gum and if
The Vanu Sovereignty obviously got to be cross at me
It’s because I’m possibly one of the
Hottest technology properties
You’ve probably seen
You never can touch this
I’m a fellow to crush gits
With every couplet
So bell up the Terran Republic
And tell them they’re getting their nuts kicked
You’re outnumbered and down for the count
Fumbling around  as it is getting louder
The sound of my sunderer
Thunderclouds are coming
So get underground or something
‘Cause I’m the real deal, sealed your fate
Best stay at your warp gate
My method of taking you out’s
In really rather poor taste
I leave you sautéed
NS-60 brought flames
Then I bring it back again
Like this upcoming chord change

Sign up
To the battle for the Planetside
This is a theatre of war
Not a pantomime
Think you can hack it?
Only the baddest can apply
So back up and decide
What kind of man am I?
A brand new kind of interplanetary samurai
The type to ram your mind into a brand new paradigm
And if the damn reply is yes then
Get down to the Planetside
If the damn reply is yes then
Get down to the Planetside

I use a flash and flank, shoot your battletank
Boost my battle rank, boot a frag into your ranks
A brutal hacky sack – You losers poo your pants
Nappy rash
Action-packed
This isn’t a hack and slash
You need precision for hacking
Stats seem to indicate the fact you lack panache
Infiltrators: grab the stash
Liberator: have to dash
Back to the Harasser fast
Mission failure? Nah, we passed
And smack the actual crap from your candy ass
People get mad at me for repeating
“Do you have any batteries?”
Like Peter Griffin I’ll leave you
Grabbing your knee in agony




 In the good﻿ times we stood side by side
Till you were blinded
By bright lights enticed by high life
In hindsight the highlight of my life
Was you and I laughing and having a nice time
Time flies it was years since I last was certain
I had not swerved from the right path
Deserted deprived of dirt that I am
The person I had been turned inside out
Hurt and dried out by winds of change
Fingers frail and a face now emersed﻿ in lines
Wrinkles ailing health are things that age
And self pity bring day in, day out
I've hours and hours of days to dwell of how I have failed myself So now I just pray for help
About how I can raise myself out from this
Groundhog day and save myself

When I play back the scenes of my youth
It seems me and you would have hated to seperate
I hesitated wasting being with you
Now were a distant step away from the better days
Let us pray that one day we'll﻿ be back
And living happily as if things had never changed
We could celebrate our freedom seven days a week
And never have to seperate from each other
Just spend our days in each others company
'Till each piece of the puzzle becomes complete
There's something sweet in the feeling life will end safe
I pretend sometimes that I've already met fate
I'm lying dead wake with baited breath
Legs of lead that I'm waiting for death
To take my life away so I can say I've finally made headway
A rest safe not lying
Bedshaped




 Hello children
I hope you're sitting comfortably
I want to tell you a story of a fellow called Henry
And a devil called Bendy

Henry thought his life was sorted
Quite looked forward to retirement
'Til he was drawn back
Right into a violent environment
One peculiar day
Henry received a strange invitation
To revisit the place
He used to work on animation
It came from Joey Drew
Explained "I've something to show you"
But was it remotely true?
Only Joey knew the true motive
Provoking him
To open up the workshop
Soaked in ink and slowly sinking lower
Since the first drop
In thirty years it's only got worse
Is this a dream?
Has it really been so long
Since our little demon hit the scene and
Kicked off a whole new industry
A star of cinema screen
Brought to life until we saw
The darkness in between
Blacker than a lung packed with tobacco, tar and nicotine
You'll have to grab the scattered parts and start the ink machine
This is so sick to see
No, Joey, don't do this to me
There are some grisly things
I'd rather keep a mystery

Why are we here?
Drowning in fear of the darkest kind
It's kind of weird
But I'm sure that I've been here some time before
You're drawn into the darkness
Floor full of pools and oozing tar pits
What awful décor, who'll renew the carpets
Who'll remove the carcass, who's the loony artist?
Ooh

All the horrors engulf
What have they done to poor Boris the Wolf?
It's rather heartless
I wouldn't bother to see if he's got any pulse
This was a repulsive ritual
Committed by sick individuals
And if you falter trying to halt them
Then they'll get you all
Come on professor
Turn on the pressure
Unless you're utterly stuck
Perhaps you need a wee refresher
Yes, sir, well it'll be my pleasure
The liquid leaking from the dresser
Isn't bleeding ketchup
Now clean this mess up
He's chasing you, the dancing demon
You've eaten too much bacon soup
Your pants are creaming
That's a meme, innit?
So don't let me catch you stealing it
So what if it's only a cartoon?
There's nothing we shan't do to harm you
If you can't prove, you are tuned for part two
We're dropping deeper into the ether
Where we will be, unlocking the secret of the machine
I didn't believe it either
Intriguing teasers seemed to be there
Leading me to seek the reason
For the secretions of this evil creature

Why are we here?
Drowning in fear of the darkest kind
It's kind of weird
But I'm sure that I've been here some time before
You're drawn into the storyboard
Calling you through doors, you're falling through the floorboards
I know you're phobic of the oozing dark
So here's a complimentary entry to the abusement park, hah




 I am Aiden and I reside inside of the mind
Or right by the side of the life that I have been tied with
I’m a violent type of vibrant light
That scientists have tried to describe
Since I was thrown along with Jodie
The only one to know me
Disowned by her folks to a zone so lonely
Caged for precaution, strange little orphan
She has a knack for actions, replacing the talking
We give a demonstration to Nathan Dawkins
But all it takes is for Clayton to walk in
The situation changes
I may need a forfeit

The truth's twofold
Seek what the truth holds
Peek through the view to beyond
Two souls
The truth's twofold
Seek what the truth holds
Peek through the view to beyond
Two souls

Hark, I’m the noise that you hear after dark
The cold chill feeling that you fear with half your heart
There’s no need to train me in martial arts
A supernatural human, that’s all
Imagine you in that form
Picture what you would do
If you could choose the platform
Traverse the universe, moving through the back door
Schrödinger's H4XOR, what did you kill that cat for?
Is it Jodie or Ellen Page? Deity or David Cage
Reality’s a game we play, grab a seat and save the day
I saw a snail crawling straight across a razor blade
And it escaped unscathed, no sign of violence
There’s no use, it’s futile trying hiding
I am Aiden

The truth's twofold
Seek what the truth holds
Peek through the view to beyond
Two souls
The truth's twofold
Seek what the truth holds
Peek through the view to beyond
Two souls




 World War II was a long time ago
Nowadays things are a little more
Incredible

It's the year 2065
The human race is just as wise
But it's had a bit too much to think lately
I don't know if it's fit to drive
We fit the fittest minds with a chip inside
That can link and digitise
That which prior to this
Was higher than science could ever devise
This is a neural interface
We're going to stick it in your face
'til it and your brain are interlaced
There's an arms war on
And we're going to win the race
Leave everything erased
Bring the bass (man)

Man and machine
Weaved like tapestry
Man what a team (machine)
Man and machine
Human minds can't handle the dream

Scientific progression is steamrolling
There's no preventing it going ahead
Now we're intrinsically linked with technology
Biology as we know it is dead
Muscle and metal are toiling
I'm not fussed of the kettle is boiling
Just ready the mech, put the oil in
There's a dastardly plot that needs foiling
We are pursuing John Taylor
He and his unit have gone awol
The motive is unclear
But I'm guessing the trope is the one same old
From New Guinea, Peru to Djibouti
Things are getting all boomy and shooty
So gird up your loins and oil your booty
And answer the Call of Duty (man)

Man and machine
Weaved like tapestry
Man what a team (machine)
Man and machine
Human minds can't handle the dream

My squad is behind me watching my hiney
Not like that
Blimey
I hide right in plain sight
And I defy thee to try to find me
I see through​ the scope with closed eyes
Finger and trigger they both collide
The bullet travels as the crow flies
And a bloke dies
See the ghost rise
Or is it just smoke?
I can't tell from the hell of the drone strikes (bang bang)
Besides I'm preoccupied with fighting
And losing is something I don't like
Sealed with a kiss
Hit you with my steel fist
But it bloody hurts
Cause despite the outside it's my real wrist
Ah, now I'm real pissed
So let me tell you what the deal is
When you deal with me and black ops
You're in for a tough time on the front line
Like Ferguson's black cops (man)

Man and machine
Weaved like tapestry
Man what a team (machine)
Man and machine
Human minds can't handle the dream
Man and machine
Weaved like tapestry
Man what a team (machine)
Man and machine
Human minds can't handle the dream




 Introduction, get a ping from Hudson
With a set of specific instructions to bust in
From Alaskan backwoods, recapture Frank Woods
You'll never find a finer example of manhood
Look, capping crooks like Captain Hook I'm that good
Snapping necks like matchwood, you bastard
I've got a taste for pain as if I drank blood
I haven't seen your face in ages, have a man hug

Shoot at me and I'll shoot you back
The future's bleak? Nah, the future's black
I said, shoot at me and I'll shoot you back
The future's bleak? Nah, the future's black
I'm Black Opsing it, (brap) pop the clip into my pistol
Now watch this shit (2x)

I'm a Vietnam vet, the damn best
Messing with your head as if I'm Russian Roulette
And yet, I'm a respectable professional and best of all
I'm the closest that you'll ever get, to being Charlton Heston, fool
I was the best in school, exceptional
But then I left it all to get some tools
And head back to the future
Stealth action shooter
C.I.A man, Marine Captain Trooper


To battle Alex Mason, That'd take some adaptation
I'm the line between rivalry and annexation
Now I'm handing the plate on to David
For another generation of bullet penetration
As enemies are taken out without hesitation
For stealth infiltration or sheer devastation




 Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim
Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim
Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim
I struggle along in vain, just to not quite make it
It's late at night, I'm awake, surprise surprise
Trying to find some kind of way to write
It's a shame,  I fail to find a blatant line
Between original art and what's plagiarised
It's vague and effectively makes playing a fresh
Melody impossible, I often wanna lay it to rest
I say with regret cos I love making music
Taking beautiful soothing sounds to make tunes with
Creating a groove and arranging and looping it
But usually it screws me straight up, I feel stupid
I need a tea break to replace my fuses
But my main mistake is that I keep making excuses
The truth is I can blatantly do this
But my brain just refuses to obey so I lose it
Thus making me choose to take painkillers and booze
Just to change up my mood plus maybe induce
A thrust of creative boost to raise me up from this place of wasted youth
And enable me to embrace my muse
Taste the fruits of the great musical roots
That grew from the days of slaves playing the blues
Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim
It's come and it's gone again I've lost my aim
Somewhere along the way, I lost my aim
My colour is gone and drained, I just might faint
So hold me so tight
Make me feel alive
Blocked out, locked out
Please, please, please not now
To find the right line to write's quite a painful paper chase
Sometimes it takes ages, other days I get it straight away
That's the main way I ever can create
But take away my aspirations and my brain's a vacant place
I hesitate for days in an attempt to make a serenade
And say something amazing to set the grade in clever ways
But fate never plays fair therefore I'll stay this way forever
Never creating 'til the end of days
Seven eighths of the time when I'm trying
To think of a lyric, picture an image or write a nice rhyme
I'm willing my mind to fill up with brilliant ideas
Bring them to life, like they were written in my tears
I fear it's quite clear I'm living a lie here
Eyes dried up but I wish I could cry, hear
Is this a signal or sign my mind's fucked up?
Cos if isn't I'm just blocked
Blocked out, locked out
Please, please, please not now
Something is wrong today, I'm not quite sane
Suddenly dropped from grace, and lost my train




 Build it up tear it down!
Rip it to pieces and flip it around!
Build it up tear it down!
Rip it to pieces and flip it around!

You probably don't know me
I'm the no gun assassin  O.P. Juan Shinobi
With a ninja star i'll injure ya
Sprinting up the walls like a spider with a katana
Head fast to the shrine now!
Flash! Then I spy and scout!
Blast! When I drop my bomb you'll be dying out in fire
Blaow!

Build it up tear it down!
Rip it to pieces and flip it around!
Build it up tear it down!
Rip it to pieces and flip it around!

I'm cogwheel, here to grind your gears
So you better have washed behind your ears
Cos i'm coming in to clean up, but instead of lotion
I'm bringing in loads and loads and loads of asplosions
Damn i'm insane!
I can openly stand in the fray
Soaking up damage
Toting the rotary canon and spray

Can I just say it's an honour to be here?
Through my monacle and goggles
Gosh, I can see clear
I'm Nigel Purdy Longshot
And if you've wandered in my sights
You've obviously gone and picked the wrong spot!
Shot in the belly? Not on your nellie
I specialise in headshots
Or chopping my machete
'Til your flopping like spaghetti
Your wedding shots are rather messy
Cause i'll use remnants of your noggin as confetti!

Build it up tear it down!
Rip it to pieces and flip it around!

OMG! look at me!
Eliza Doolally
Leet in toxicology. Got a PHD in AOE
My acid attack is massively accurate
Splashes are stacking
Racking up the kills
You slackers are still lagging!
You're lacking the ill swagger
I have on the kill cam!
Add in the fact i'm as mad as a hatter
And my appeal is apparent
Take of your skin as if i'm peeling a carrot!
A connoisseur of the miracle cure
Pour it like vintage claret

I'm Sarge stone
You might know I'm large, bro
I pack a bandanna, Hand cannon and an afro
I'm a killing machine from the military!
Half human being, half barrage of artillery!
I deal damage, Full frontal assault!
'Til I reset everything you've done to default

Build it up tear it down!
Rip it to pieces and flip it around!

Do you remember me?
I'm the engineer
That will send my enemy up into the celestial sphere
I'm Tony Turretto and when I set up a defence here
You can rest assured it'll be better than a fence
Yeah!
I'm talking bullets
Caulking turrets
Chucking rivets
I brought the Brooklyn spirit
And i'm fricking awesome with it!

Build it up tear it down!
Rip it to pieces and flip it around!




 When I was a baby, I was born!
But I wasn't born in a hospital..
I was
BORN
IN
BLOOD!
Yayy!

Rah!
This town to which I've come is hellish
Full of malice, the sun has vanished
Now it's overrun with rabid grubs and maggots
So I guess it's good I'm hooded
Clad in rugged rags and brandishing a massive bloody mallet
The Hunter's plan is plundering an underground pungent palace overrun with baddies
A Chalice dungeon, that is
And should I perish in this parish, this gothic ghetto
Fret not, I'm coming back to get my blood echoes!

Bloodborne, we were born in blood
Snuff all of your torches and throw up your hoods
Bloodborne, we were born in blood
Now we rise from the dark like morning wood

The graveyard's my playground, swing on the beast claw
Logarius merry-go-round
Did you ever see saw?
I want to play a game, flamespray and maim
Any tainted dog, beast, boar or maiden
Man I flay and aim my blade
Spread their brains on the pavement like Mayonnaise
'til their late like passengers on Merseyrail Railways
How I miss the gay old days, sun on my pale face
Nah, son I'm a trailblazer
Never save, no failsafe
These doomed peasents' future isn't too pleasant
Little more than a source of food for the moon presence
So you'd better use your communion runes or do penance
For absolution shall elude you without true repentance
Neuter you with a Saw Cleaver, leave you with a sore beaver
It'll hurt more than missing spoiler alerts on Saul Teasers
Or biting grapeshot you thought were some maltesers
This region's never even seen a person called Jesus

Bloodborne, we were born in blood
Snuff all of your torches and throw up your hoods
Bloodborne, we were born in blood
Now we rise from the dark like morning wood (rah)

Watch the Brick Troll, his hits sting more than rick rolls
Or sticking a Tonitrus right into your dickhole
I use a hunchback as a human punchbag
And when I'm done I have him running back to school without his lunchpack
And here's a fun fact: my Hunter Axe
Has a somewhat different function that it would were I a lumberjack
I'm sick enough to recite that Monty Python bit
While swiping it from side to side in the middle of a viper pit
How did I get my job? Where did I find the gig?
Let's just put it this way: I didn't apply for it
And I might be sick, but the true boss isn't me exactly
Tip your hat to Mr. Hidetaka Miyazaki

Bloodborne, we were born in blood
Snuff all of your torches and throw up your hoods
Bloodborne, we were born in blood
Now we rise from the dark like morning wood

(Bloodborne, we were born in blood)
(Snuff all of your torches and throw up your hoods)
(Bloodborne, we were born in blood)
(Now we rise from the dark like morning wood)




 My name’s Detective Ronan O’Connor
In my line of work, I’m facing death daily
But now it’s me who’s a goner
In Salem P.D. of all the homicides, Lord
I’d never say that it’d be me lying on the sidewalk
But whatever I thought, it’s become irrelevant
My skeleton’s regressing through the elements
And evidently, I’m undead ‘til I seek and get the evidence
One foot in the grave has made me one step ahead of him
I’ll make him taste his own medicine: the Bell Killer
Devout sinner, I doubt we’re dealing with a swell fella
How did it happen? I need help with it
Throw the laws of physics out the window, go to town with it
I can walk through substances to suss out who the suspect is
But can’t discuss or talk about the subject with them ‘cause I must exist
I’m an ethereal, pulp noir serial star
But this is real despite appearing immaterial

I can’t explain it, I’m on a hunt for the truth
To why my assailant made me plummet from under the roof
Salem is a place containing hundreds of clues
And my presumption is that somewhere in it somebody goofed

Woke up in a murder scene, a ghost interred in Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me
Woke up in a murder scene, interred in Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me
Murder scene, Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me

How can I trust girls I find in the Dusk World?
Its dank musty musk must just blur lines
Slur words, disrupt and usurp minds
A corruption of the worst kind
But I need all the aid that I can find
Between mediums and demons, I will mainly have to pry
Maybe have to find, a shady patch and hide
From their crazy appetite, I’m not a tasty snack, am I?
I've already made the sacrifice of life
And the fact is I would like to not have to die twice
My mind keeps rewinding back to that night
The facts of what happened don’t just stack up quite right

I can’t explain it, I’m on a hunt for the truth
To why my assailant made me plummet from under the roof
Salem is a place containing hundreds of clues
And my presumption is that somewhere in it somebody goofed

Woke up in a murder scene, a ghost interred in Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me
Woke up in a murder scene, interred in Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me
Murder scene, Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me

Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?
Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?
Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?
Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?




 Every one of my friends is dead
Now all I want is revenge instead
I'm a part-time engine head
And a part-time filler of heads with lead
Ever since the Washington Incident
I've been itching to become intimate
In the militant tense
With those who have triggered and given defence
In a literal sense
I'm taking 'em out
Not on a date
But I'm laying them down
I hate the debate with the Gamergaters
And Tumblr pages are just player haters

I'm a bombshell
Nothing will stop me from being a bombshell
Whether disability or demons from hell
I stick to my guns just in case you can't tell
You've just been hit by a bombshell

Every one of my friends is dead
Now all I want is revenge instead
Blowing Kyrronite
Like dynamite
On ammunition, diminish any sign of life
In my line of sight
There's two types of guys
Those that will buy me a pint
Or die
Some say I'm arrogant
But that's bad of them
Nah, the fact is I'm adamant
That with practise I'll smash any challenges
And be the champion
I fancy my chances
A warrior woman, an Amazon
Run any marathon
I'm Shelly Harrison
I am a calm, collected person
With a bionic arm, but I'm set to burst
On any threat that's lurking
Get to working
Instead of just sitting on the net just surfing

I'm a bombshell
Nothing will stop me from being a bombshell
Whether disability or demons from hell
I stick to my guns just in case you can't tell
You've just been hit by a bombshell

Every one of my friends is dead
Now all I want is revenge instead
Recognise I'm mechanised
Wrecking lives
What you reckon, nice?
I live an isometric life
But I spread dread in concentric lines
So step in line
Or you're getting fired
By electric shells and electromines
You're treading a fine line
I'm heading to find President Skye
Zeroth is mine
Race to the end
Repel an attacker
Say hello to my friend
Motherflakker

I'm a bombshell
Nothing will stop me from being a bombshell
Whether disability or demons from hell
I stick to my guns just in case you can't tell
You've just been hit by a bombshell




 I'm a Creeper
Minecraft's Grimm Reaper
Blowing up blocks like Al-Qaeda
I'm not a creature that'll eat ya
But I'll leave ya petrified, Peter!
Reminds peeps of Minesweeper
Clicking on a brick, then you die in the deep
I'll find your mine, I'm a mind reader
Now the mine is mine, it's finders keepers
Oh hai, I'm a creeper
So nice, nice to meet ya
Is that the time? It's time to leave
And tick tock, tick tock

Boom boom boom!
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
It's gonna make my brain go boom boom boom!
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
(Pew, pew, pew)

I do what I wanna
Move aside, mama
Tick tick, I'm a suicide bomber!
I take control, then I'm gonna
Leave a gaping hole, Belladonna
That'll take its toll
When I'm on a quest to invade
Detonate your soul!
Fizz like a lemonade then blow
So you better stay indoors
Or I'll find your mine when you're mining ore
You'll be dying, lying in gore
Darling, ow, what you crying for?
Did somebody break your diamond sword?
I'm the volatilest sort
What a violent force
That'll frighten Spartans hark and hear Leonidas talk
When he sees me: "Tonight we dine indoors!"

Boom boom boom!
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
It's gonna make my brain go boom boom boom!
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
(Pew, pew, pew)

It's official
A ballistic missle
Couldn't get this result
I blow through stone like a six foot chisel
So you better shiver when you hear that sizzle
Fffffo shizzle!
Take a listen!
It's a premonition of my mission
Death by demolition!
If I don't come home there's a sign in my kitchen
To describe why I'm missing: Gone fission
White hot raps
I got stacks
Sometimes when I die, I drop tracks
I got a lot
Ocelot
Fight off cats
If I'm feeling nice, then I might not...
BLAST!

Boom boom boom!
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
It's gonna make my brain go boom boom boom!
I can't stop singing this bloody tune, tune, tune
(Pew, pew, pew)
My hobbies and interests include going...
BOOM BOOM BOOM!




 In the past, the internet
Didn't have video yet
Then there came a website
Called YouTube to make it right
240p
Was the size of a video
And the audio
Was mono, not stereo
You could not upload a song
Longer than ten minutes long
Then we got a data boost
New features were introduced

Quality increased from 240 pixels in 360
And YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3gp
Hey Hey!
Netflix, Ustream, Roku and lets not forget Apple TV
Another data boost
As we got used
To browsing audiovisually  EE

Suddenly, we're in the realm of HD
A whole new level of quality
720p
And we went from 4:3
Black bars on the side to full widescreen
With faster data plans and broadband
It's like your holding a whole cinema in your hand
I hope you brought your 3D specs
So you can see what's coming up next

720p was clearly never sufficient
So boost of 1080 improve your vision
Of the screen
As the videos streams
Automatic subtitles transcribe your speech
Vevo, thumbs up, and HTML5
I can't imagine the size of the disk drives, it's like
Band width gets bigger every minute
We need another data boost
Just so we can keep up with it

The scene's a sea
Were swimming deep within it
Singers, streamers, comedians, memers
Keen
It seems we're keen to reach the limit
It's our forte
Everything that came before
Was foreplay
But of course were going to raise the rate to 4K
With more frames
Enabling smoother views of your games
Youtubers are huge news for the new youth
Old media bequeathing the future an leaving it to you
I think you know by now what we need to do:
Boost

Now it's natural that we are
Becoming compatible with VR
Caviar
Running in 8K color space capable of displaying HDR
360 degrees, it must seen for it to be believed
It must be heard Just like the world "Skrt Skrt"
I don't know what that even means
All I know is everything is getting more excessive
Every morning I see something that is ever more impressive
All my messages amassing even faster than I get em
The progression is so fast that I cannot even get a breath in
What do you think of the fact
Bringing the track back from the beginning of rap
Fresh as cinnamon baps
And, in the middle of that, Dan's reminiscing about
Video stats, still managing to kill it with brilliant facts
He really is fast




 We are off to the Moon
And it's full of lunatics with a new bag of tricks
This place needs luminous lick of paint
While I'm doin' this shit
Comin' through on a humorous tip
Then I switch from a clown to the brutalest prick
Getting through many clips
So my trigger fingers superhumanly ripped
Is there room in the Inn for a Lawbringer?
Enforcing enforcers to forcefully
Pick up a fork and nick your dinner?
Give some applause, I'm a pure winner
I'm a mixture of helpful and selfish
Marshal and Elvis, shark and a shellfish
Armed amour, and well fit, can't help it
I'm departing to Elpis
Woah
Everything's going all wobbly

I'mma find a pile of scrap to mash up in a grinder
Camp on a cliff and snipe ya
I'm a larger brain matter collider
Smashing up atoms and splattering minds up
No wonder that I have to remind you that
Hang one a second, what's that just behind you?
Got you in the botty with a shotty
Now your as a Nosh from a Rotty
Not rocky but I'll knock you out with my noccas
Gnocchi, out with your knockers
Moxxii, she's so hot I'm hot by Proxy
And Athena, have you seen her?
That Gladiator doesn't need an arena
Tell them Tiny Tina, just what she does
To my wiener's demeanor
Could I even be keener if she switched my decaf creamer
For a Cleavland Steamer, I'm an eager beaver
Too bloody sweet for a tea with sweetener
I launch VaultHunter.exe, so Doom you can keep your BFG, sir
Don't need that to leave your face looking like a piece of pizza
When the Moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie
That’s a ballache, a ballache
When the Moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie
Thats a ballache, a ballache

To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (where?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (what?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (where?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back

He's a bastard, Handsome Jack
Keep the cash, have your ransom back
Him and dastardly plans get together
Like France and Jacques Chirac
'Cause this is what happens when twats attack
And if you answer back, then I'll clamp our trap
Fancy that, I'm a Dandy Dan, a fancy man in a fancy hat!
Claptrap hits hard and as hard as a clap track
On a no limit record clap track
If it moves, I'll frag that, bring it down like the NASDAQ
With my arsenal, I'm tear aparting all
Grammar Nazis that start a war
I don't want to boast, but I'm rather awe inspiring
When I'm flingin' bars galore
Hit with a critical? Typical, I told you shit'd get physical
Clips galore but I piss them all away in your face
Shoot anything from a brute to a cute bunny
Loot like a gold digger with a new hubby
Now I can't fit into my suit, 'cause I'm too tubby
That pile of sands glitched, is the dune buggy?

To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (where?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (what?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (where?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back




 We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't... ah, forget it
Born in the ashes

Each night I used to dream of being a fighter
It seemed to me to be the right key for me to strive for
I mindlessly believed I'd lead a life of real excitement
Heedless of the peace of mind I'd need to leave behind for it
I lay to rest the playful innocent days I was a lad
Now I'm driven by the hate to vindicate my mum and dad
Eliminate the man who won't discriminate 'tween good and bad
Flay him with the blade I made and feel the pain I've suffered
That whoreson ripped away the pure fulfilment that I could have had
So should you ask me if I'd love to kill him: Well yeah, just a tad
I'll thrust and stab him 'til he's just a sack of blood and rags
Then drag him through the gutter, shove him back into his mother's vag
Gather the ashes of the pillaged village and then build a palace
We'll fill a chalice and then tilt it out for silver Skalitz

Born in the ashes of a joy torn away from me
I was a boy whose dreams turned round and now they're chasing me
Born in the ashes of a simple and wholesome being
I was a boy whose goals turned round unfolding in ways unseen
Born in the ashes

Sharp metal leaves a vicious cut, but nettle leaves'll fix it up
Our quest'll being inflicting justice on the beasts who think it's nothin'
So run to Sigismund, give him the signal, this is coming
And that imprisonment isn't the system with which he'll be punished
He'll witness his kingdom coming down without deliverance
As brick and rubble crumbles, crushing his ambition into dust
I'm just a humble smith's son who won't be pissed on
Who won't stop thinking of you gettin' hung 'til it's done
You'll tell me what I need to know or there'll be fists swung
A knuckle sandwich always loosens up a stiff tongue
Witness the son of a blacksmith giving someone a slapped wrist
With a couple of axes, the fact is, your death is a certain as taxes
Gather the ashes of the pillaged village and then build a palace
We'll fill a chalice and then tilt it out for silver Skalitz

Born in the ashes of a joy torn away from me
I was a boy whose dreams turned round and now they're chasing me
Born in the ashes of a simple and wholesome being
I was a boy whose goals turned round unfolding in ways unseen
Born in the ashes

I know I'm no genius, but no leader of Bohemia's so lenient
That they won't see me looking like I'm lacking obedience
I don't show allegiance to no thieving deviants
Or show weakness, I grow freely from home grown ingredients
I will train until our name and the vow I made are renowned
A phrase that'll travel way throughout the reign resound and make any man afraid
Who are now engaged in power plays, they'll have a case of sour grapes
They'll bow in shame, marrow, veins, bowel and brains will drown in pain
Flowers placed on a shallow grave, hell awaits you
But now Satan's an hour late at the tower gates
The panel breaks and the foundations
Now shaking, ground quaking, devout placing our faith
In the hallowed grace and marinade it 'til the arrows rain, the spell, it breaks
Nothing can heal the damage, this anguish will not vanish
The grief's so real, it's not a feeling I'll reveal with language
But Radzig Kobyla's got the will to help dispel the hell
Let's never stop until we've got the steel that killed your dad
Let's gather the ashes of the pillaged village and then build a palace
We'll fill a chalice and then tilt it out for silver Skalitz

Born in the ashes of a joy torn away from me
I was a boy whose dreams turned round and now they're chasing me
Born in the ashes of a simple and wholesome being
I was a boy whose goals turned round unfolding in ways unseen
Born in the ashes

Born in the ashes




 Over oceans, civilisations behold
The UK taking control
A naval nation of old
Built on a foundation of coal
That was taken and sold
So they could pave it with gold
To make the altars that they failed to use to pray for the souls
Who excavated and rolled
Trains into stations to mould
The global stage where they were playing a role
For those who'd later withold
Them from the tale that was told
To fete the brave and the bold
So they could claim it was stole
Instead they lay in deprivation and cold
Poor sanitation and mold
Without a savior to follow
It's not like they can enrol
Rebel or make an assault
HALT, enter Evie Frye and Jacob
Revolt

I am a British assassin
Rather proficient in fashion
Look in the mirror, yeah, the image is dashing
I'm sending a Templar to hell
On every single ring of Big Ben's Bell
I am a British assassin
Me and my sister are cashing in
On the city's riches and it's flipping cracking
I send a templar unto the grave
For every soot stained cobble with which London is paved

This is a major event
So you best pay Jacob attention
In in age of innovation, invention
Evie and me are the train and the engine
Slicing straight through the tension
With a hidden blade to the tendon
How clear can I state my intention?
Fed up of Gentry living rent free
While peasants pay an arm and a leg for entry
Don't send for a detective
Let me make this Elementary:
I'm that assassin other chaps try and pretend to be
My enemy's enemy's potentially a friend to me
From Ezio and Edward Kenway through to Henry Green
Killing is our business and in business we're immensely keen
Roughing up these gangs
Although there's nothing in my hands
But for a couple of brass knuckles
And a kukri that I swang'
From the stricken slums of Southwark
To the suckers in the strand
Suddenly snuck into a cab
And then I'm just another chap
Strutting, striding over Whitechapel
Landing in Lambeth with ease
Bite the Apple of Eden
And plant the seeds in London's streets
Come and reap the fruits of our labour
And bite the hand that feeds
We're the gang Anglia needs
The Assassin's Creed
We study war to run like water through the ruddy order
Tend to every Templar starting with that bugger bloody Nora
I make her blighters face my blade and die
Veins are sliced
Baptised by the rain at night
They wish they were safe and dry
So crack open a case of wine
Grab your glass and raise it high
Take your time to say goodbye
Yours faithfully, Jacob Frye

I am a British assassin

Living in Victorian England)




 I'm flossing
Open wide
You may feel a small amount of discomfort
As I sink my teeth into this issue
Fucking let's go

I was a jolly good child
But never had a Hollywood smile
I probably should be bothered but I'm not
'cause my gob is just part of my ebullient style
Charmingly funny and vile
Like Stan, Cartman, Kenny and Kyle
Met a woman, it was good for a while
Then I grinned and had her running a mile
Ugh... look at all that spit
I've got a mouth like a Sarlacc Pit
I look a bit like I was kicked to the kerb
And my teeth took it worse than the Tarmac I bit
I'm a little bit Ricky Gervais
If he was hit with a brick in the face
Dirty cunt
Perverted version of Kirsten Dunst
But worse in person 'cause of a certain oniony pungence
Line up girls, who's first in front?
Got a tongue like a Persian rug
Fuck mouthwash, pass the detergent *glug*
This is urgent look, get a surgeon booked
Who can work with the curtains shut
Too squeamish to floss, bleeding is gross
So please just leave me to rot
'cause believe it or not
I really am reasonably pleased with the teeth that I've got
Don't give a fuck whether you're a fan of mine
Stop... Arm & Hammer time

You're jelly of my British teeth
I'm a vicious beast
If you do not like my music
Then it's obvious that you are just too jelly of my British teeth
I'm a vicious beast, I'm a vicious beast
I'm a vicious beast, I'm a vicious beast with British teeth

Fresh got them whitened, I might get them straightened
But I kind of like to frighten the states with them
And would Amy Winehouse
Have sounded the same without the wide mouth?
And the same applies to Shane MacGowan
John Lydon, Clint Howard
Think "Lemmy meets Steve Buscemi"
I can already see your semi
See you're jelly of my British teeth aplenty
See your envy
I'm the MVP of dentistry on the NHS
My teeth are sexy
I bring the Aquafreshest raps
Grinning like a Cheshire Cat
Fuck your feckless standards of beauty
You can shut your precious mash
My dentist was the gentlest
She never did a thing that was senseless
She sensibly selected medical consensus over aesthetic pretenses
Regarding hygiene my teeth are quite clean
But far from the whitest I've seen
They used to be white, now they're yellowing
Maturing like Cheddar and mellowing
Developing into better things
They're getting ever more menacing
Snapping like a terrapin
When I'm dead, I'll be outlived by my skeleton

You're just jelly of my British teeth
I'm a vicious beast
If you do not like my music
Then it's obvious that you are just too jelly of my British teeth
I'm a vicious beast, I'm a vicious beast
I'm a vicious beast, I'm a vicious beast with British teeth




 A distant district full of mystery
A kid with history
He lost his mother in the sea
And thus he missed her deeply
What a disastrous event
He's not going to let it happen again
Whether dragons or men
He's battling them
To protect his family
Prevent the tragedy happening again
But the chances are stacking against it
His dad has collapsed
He's had an attack
And that's going to test his friendship
With his brother
They grab the barrow and drag it
To one of the medicine men quick
The medic is hesitant
It's evident this will need better than lemsip
It's time for the siblings to set aside their quibblings
In favour of the big things and stride with all their might
Until they find the tree of life whose leaves provide a healing liquid
The quicker they fly, the quicker they might
Relieve their father's sickness

Brothers A Tale of Two Sons 

The family bond will have to be strong
If they're going to take calamity on
Collaborate, co-operate
Co-ordinating, carrying on
Challenges, allergies, tragedies, maladies
Neither or either of them are a fan of these
No reprieve for a breather, It's anarchy
Don't know where we would be without family
These brothers need mothers
Like they need each other
One of them to man the oars
The other one to be the rudder
Whether covered in blood or mud
The blood runs deep
Deep as the allegiance these loved ones keep
It guards you while you sleep
Holds back the darkness
Cold as a carcass
With soul black and heartless
But there's something it can't touch
And that's fraternity
Try as you might to break
It last for an eternity

Brothers A Tale of Two Sons 

I'm lost without him
A moth without wings
It's like I lost a limb
My arms are crossed without him
Cross my heart
My heart is crushed without him
I'd cross the mountain tops
A thousand times again to bring him back
But I can't
No matter just how much I'm shouting
I'm drowning
The current pulls me down
There's no one else so much as helping
What woud my brother do?
Haven't got a clue
But I feel a fire that burns in me
And lifts me, It's fraternity
Try as you might to break it
It lasts for an eternity
Yes, there's something you can't crush
And that's fraternity
Try as you might to break
It lasts for an eternity




 Seven days of the week my brain's at it's peak
That's the payback you reap from being a blatant geek
Then maybe you'll see why so many people feel it
My speech is lethal, meaning feeble people fear it
But if you fear it maybe you need to re-hear it
I talk about what other lyricists are scared to
I tackle issues you wish you could dare to
And fair do's if you're sticking to the horrorcore
But don't go moaning that nobody's wanting more
Sitting on bean bags listening to weed rap
Bitching that the kids would rather hear Relapse
Don't you see that you're missing the point?
'cause no-one gives a shit what you stick in your joint
So if you're disappointed then learn a lesson
Convert to better methods and then heads'll yearn for seconds

We don't bum your shit
So come up with something better than it
When you're the only one to bum your shit
Then come up with something better than it

Look, mmm, I've got to be real
There's not a lot of rappers out here that I honestly feel
You see me, I'd bite your hand off if you offered a deal
'cause I've got kids that need warm water and a quality meal
For real, I pride myself on being versatile
Like my hooks Auto-Tuned, still keep the verses wild
So if you don't like me singing on my hooks
Then don't listen - the fact is, I couldn't give a...
Look, they're acting like they're Premier League
Forced multi-syllabics over knock-off Premier beats
In a scene where everybody seems to be next in the scene
And the need to be credible is becoming incredibly weak
Gzus, let's keep it moving
'cause for people to feel your music you need improvement
Like live shows where you get your respect
They're like trapeze acts 'cause their life depends on the net
Joey

We don't bum your shit
So come up with something better than it
When you're the only one to bum your shit
Then come up with something better than it

Too many rappers just rap about rap
There's a whole world out there, rap about that
What happens now is a matter of fact
So if you want to keep it real, put that on a track
I stand back to back with novelists and poets
Activists, journalists, and those that show it's
An ugly world out there, when it should be beautiful
But if beauty is truth, then I stay true to form
Who'd have thought the class clown would back down
Into the background and lay some fat tracks down?
I stand proud behind what I believe
And what I believe is I can't believe what I've achieved
Every step of the way I get better
But nevertheless I make it my aim to elevate every day
No matter what it takes it's worth paying the price
'cause the day you stop learning is the day you die




 This is addressed to Geoff Taylor of the BPI
Thanks to STB for the beat
You're the BPI's VIP and you've picked a fight with TPB
But P2P's too deep to preclude, don't you see?
You can't stop it
You won't stop it
You won't block it
So find another way to lie and line your own pocket
Most of us have composed a lot, no profit
99% of us will never have a pop hit
It's not rocket science, so don't knock it
And don't pretend like you're being philanthropic
Talent isn't rare, it doesn't need protection
Any claim to the contrary is pure condescension
A con, deception, the wrong perception
Propagated by a proper dong, it's evident
Go to any pub
In any town
In any county
And count the musicians doing it without need
For some rudes in suits, shitting on our scene
And sticking in the boot
So you can stop telling me stuff
Put your money where your mouth is
And take a salary cut
Cause I'll happily put your cash into the hat of a busker
The BPI doesn't give a fuck for

Look, I've studied your justifications of what you seem to think
There couldn't be a clearer case of circular reasoning
You judge talent by how well they're selling
But they're only selling from how well you're selling them
You think Adele'd have reached where she was
Without the media machine feeding the buzz
You say artist should get paid for the work they do
But you only care about the ones that bring in revenue
If the bottom line is the sign of a good artist
The why the need to manipulate the market?
So Pro laissez faire you recommend protectionism
Where's your decision, on which method it is or isn't?
The only way your in today's position
Is through decades of ripping of plagiarism
But now the next generation's risen
You're complaining "Hey, we need to change the system
These crazy kids and their disco dancing
It isn't legitimate if we haven't cleared the sampling"
But surely sampling is always a bad thing
Not just when the bank accounts need balancing
And if MC's are paid related to their talent
How come I make a fraction of what T-Pain is selling?
If I re-made a ballad with sheen aimed at amorous teenagers
Daniel'd be famous now but it isn't gonna happen
So I'll stick to rapping with integrity
Something your industry is lacking

Ask any MC or composer
Piracy?
Yes Please! It's the only method I know to my VSTs
Nothing is proportionate, the prices are extortionate
To lawfully produce, only a portion can afford the stuff
I'm sure that cutting off connections and dealing bans
Would leave the music scene desolate, completely bland
Innovation comes from underground
Where there ain't much money round
So we resort to lawlessness to make the funny sounds
And then of course all that goes around comes around
The majors wander round and plunder from the underground
See you need us as much as we need you
And that might not be much depending on your view
I was once on the tube once and overheard a conversation
Between two rec execs planning exploitation
A singer had passed on
So they tacked a crap track onto the back catalogue
And laughed a lot
I thought: "I can't believe it, this is a mix up"
I'm literally listening to paint a vulgar picture
That the BPI can leave a site on the net censored
Is an incredibly terrible threat to the new tech sector
Now there's a industry that really needs fighting for
They're the future, you're just a wounded dinosaur


Tchaikovsky didn't need the BPI
Stravinsky didn't need the BPI
Verdi didn't need the BPI
Vivaldi didn't need the BPI
Rossini didn't need the BPI
Debussy didn't need the BPI
Puccini didn't need the BPI
So why do we need the BPI?
I don't need the BPI
Homeless busker doesn't need the BPI
British music doesn't need the BPI
The future doesn't need the BPI
You don't need the BPI
We don't need the BPI
They don't need the BPI
The BPI needs the BPI

 For a long time, I grew up thinking I was lazy. But then one day, I realised: I'm not lazy. I just have really high standards. For doing stuff. Efficient
Call me any nasty word: bum, slob, slacker, nerd
I can't be arsed to come up with a comeback you haven't heard
Can't be arsed to do my tax return, I've got cash to burn
And I can't be arsed to invest the stacks I've earned
Can't be arsed to chat, converse with you, I'm taciturn
Can't be arsed to drive a car because I'd have to learn
Can't be asked press the gas, I kinda like the back seat
Thank God for Uber cause I can't be asked to call a taxi
To take the rubbish out (well) I'd have to pick it up and put it down
And my brown wheelie bin's got a funny smell
Simple daily stuff is a battle to grapple with tasks that should be natural's too much of a hassle, I'm stuck in a shackle
Every kilojoule I physically exert, strenuous
Just point me to where the desert menu is!
Can't be arsed to hit the kitchen, not moving out this seat
What food I'll have to eat
Pot Noodle, naturally
Can't be arsed to feed the cat, little needy twat
Don't want to peel a pack and pour it, can't you deal with that?
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Can't be arsed to wake up and get out of bed
I'm the laziest from A to... Eff-it can't be arsed with the alphabet
Effort? Eff-it!
Retention? Forget it!
Tension? Don't stress it, getting too much? Just let it
Can't be arsed to open the post and pay the bills
Can't be arsed to practice rap and elevate my skills
Can't be arsed to open my eyes or socialise
Can't be arsed to vocalise
I can't be arsed with shows and live sets, learning loads of lines
Can't be arsed to leave the house, I'm staying home tonight
Can't be arsed to visit mates of mine, it's a waste of time, I can play online and get my gossip through the grapevine
Can't be arsed to shave my face or get a haircut, to trek up to the barbers just to trek back cause they're shut
So my hair is messed up, I can't be arsed to style it, I let myself go, and can't be arsed to fight it
I've lost all control and can't be arsed to find it
Ha, freestyling this song, I can't be arsed to write it
Can't be arsed to rap on beat, I rap off
Beat
Hehe!
Can't be arsed to even laugh properly
Can't be arsed to try composing melodies with no luck
I C.B.A. to write my own hook!
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
It doesn't matter what it is, man, I can't be arsed
Come to think of it, I can't be arsed to not be arsed
And if I can't be arsed to not be arsed, I can't be arsed to not be arsed to not be arsed
So I guess that means I can't be arsed to write filler
Because I can't be arsed to be considered anything apart from an ice-cold mic-killer
Can't be arsed with your rap so I will write songs
Can't be arsed with tiredness so I sleep all night long
Can't be arsed to go on the doll so I got a full-time job
Got a girlfriend that can't be arsed to pull my knob
Can't be arsed to masturbate, over the past few days I've been far too busy to be arsed to procrastinate
I stand out, can't be arsed to hang out in the background
Hit the gym cause I can't be arsed to carry all that fat round
Keep it deep I can't be arsed to dumb the track down
I can't be arsed to not make my mum and dad proud I
Can't be arsed to be fat, so when I see snacks I think "You know what? I can't be arsed to eat that."
Can't be arsed to die young from heart disease
Can't be arsed to force my blood through clogged up arteries
Can't be arsed to be hard to please so I take it easy cause I can't be arsed to make my own life hard for me
I'd like to say I do it for my health but I just can't be arsed to delegate I do it all myself
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
Effort? Eff-it, Eff-it
I used to think: "Eff-it, I'm not doing it."
But now I think: "Eff-it, I'm doing it!"
I used to think: "Eff-it, I'm not doing it."
But now I think: "Eff-it, I'm doing it!"




 I'm the most heartless of businessmen, I'm on a mission:
Harming the climate with carbon emission
Falsify facts to calm opposition
Despite the obvious harsher condition we live in
The thermometer's splitting
Can't take the heat?
Then depart from the kitchen
Just stop all the bitching, I'm trynna' do business
Acquiring riches is like a religion
Melt the last ice caps, just like that
Deploy propaganda to gaslight stats
Then cry 'fake news' when I dislike facts
That's my strategy, that's my act
Slash and burn and amass my cash
Salt the scorched Earth, just for a laugh
Don't get caught in the global warming hoax
All the warnings are totally boring!

I, just want to watch the world burn
Earn what's mine
'Til we arrive at the point of no return
I, just want to watch the world burn
Burn
We'll never learn, we'll never learn, we'll never learn...

Aim:
Create massive pain
Spray acid rain
Assassinate Mother Nature, that's the game
Natural disaster, that's what we're after
Tapping that ass like I'm fracking for gas
Look:
Gas guzzler
Mass muzzler
Fact shuffler
Crap shoveller
Blast muffler
The whole planet's last hustler
Dat autocratic fat cat sat smug on a pandaskin rug
That I had smuggled in from the jungle I'm cutting up
My cash stocks and the temperature's looking up
No inspectors'll get through me
You'll regret if you reckon that I'll let you see
I'll affect every breath you breathe
Chainsmoke cigarettes in my SUV
I'll choke the sheriff and the deputy
Turn everyone on Earth to a refugee
I revel in seeing the sea level reach a new piece of the beach 'til the piers beneath it
The Devil and the deep blue sea you're between
It's too late to cease when you've already seen it
Rip right through reefs like a riptide
Look right to the sky, see hypocrites ride
Private planes while describing the ways we should fight the invasion of climate change
Stop their childish ways off the climbing frames
I say put 'em on the firing range
I'm a tyrant, violent to my environment
Crimes against nature, acquiring a pile of 'em
Innit ironic, that I run it, when I couldn't give a flying fog if anyone'll survive from it?
I'm not even being hyperbolic, I'm diabolic
Never do I wanna' see a dial with a smile on it!

I, just want to watch the world burn
Earn what's mine
'Til we arrive at the point of no return
I, just want to watch the world burn
Burn
We'll never learn, we'll never learn, we'll never learn...




 A dream is nothing
Without a team looking out for you
Pulling you through
In everything you do
Helping you improve
In ways you never knew
Even your most mountainous plans
Are molehills with the helping hands
Of a friend when (wha) you're depending (wha)
On them to attend to the strength of the engine (yeah)
When the pressure is getting to you
They can tell (can tell)
They're a safety valve (valve)
Making sure you're safe and well
Because going it alone isn't the same somehow (nah)
So whatever you campaign
Make sure that you're sharing the champagne (yeah)
So whatever you campaign
Make sure that you're sharing the champagne

And when the plan changes, every man rages
But nothing can't be fixed with a handshake
Quick (quick), get (get)
Back in control of the mission
Back in the soul of your vision
Back into pole position (one)
Like a racecar
Chasing the greates of grades, A Star
Have faith in the plan for your campaign (yeah)
And when you're done
You can hand me the champagne
(Hand me the champagne)

Push off of the block (let's go)
Quick, forward
We're not gonna stop
'Til we're (what?) victorious
Gone in a shot
Pistorius
Everyone who helped me on the way
I missed all of you
So I raise a glass (cheers), as I'm racing past
No time to be slow, though I'm chasing laps (hah)
Acing tracks with amazing raps
So you better have faith in the fact
That my pacing is nothing short of invigorating
Breaking the sound barrier when I say things (whoosh)
A high-speed chase is my plaything (hey)
So if haters are hating
The amount of heed that I pay to what they think (hah)
Is the same as the speed of my steed when I'm braking (woo!)
Straight into the pit stop (hah)
This is hip hop (hah)
Straight into the pit stop (hah)
This is hip hop (ah)
Straight into the pit stop (hah)
This is hip hop (ah)
Let's go!
Carlos has gone and dropped
That rhythm
We're as solid as a rock
Precision
Anybody said we're not
They're kidding
Living in a prison where opinion is fiction
So we kick them off the grid and...
Good riddance
Negativity is explicitly forbidden
So bring some positivity
And then you'll be forgiven
Together we can get ahead
Collectively we're driven

You and me, we're the key and the ignition
Rev ahead and never get into a collision (quick)
Quick (quick), get (get)
Back in control of the mission
Back in the soul of your vision
Back into pole position (one)
Like a race car (yeah)
Chasing the greatest of grades, A Star
Have faith in the plan for your campaign
And when you're done
You can hand me the champagne




 Seriously though
So
The people have spoken
And nobody's really sure what they've said
All we can tell is
They want some changes

Dear David
So you're taking the reins from Labour
Just don't handle them with force
Or Lady Britannia could fall from her horse
Not all of us are sure whether you're the right fellow
To weather us to port in this storm;
Although I'm sure that when Gordon was brought in
We'd have been better off trying to talk to a wall
You wanted to be seen as the man down the street
Now you're the man in Downing Street
I'm not asking you to live in a glass house
But we'd be glad to see a bit of transparency
Thatcher's been and smashed the glass roof
But now you've got a grass roof - the thatcher's been
You better watch it doesn't catch a beam
From the grassroots camera's gleam because the heat's on
These days when a scandal's seen
It's like there's no smoke without fire, matches please
People are fed up and hate being treated as second rate
They're ready to see a head on a plate
That's not me by the way, we'd get on as mates
But I'm just saying be ready to take it

That's just the way that it is
(That's just the way it is)
Ah, yeah (Things'll never be the same)
Ooh yeah (That's just the way it is)
Yep (ah yeah)

Ay
I see no changes, all I see is eighties faces
Made up with a public relations facelift
And when Cameron's on camera he makes it
Easy to see his patriot's bracelet
Can you blame our aversion to
Another Tony Blair: version two?
You're the person who's serving us
So we deserve a dude we can trust
But you Tories talk about big society
I thought there was no such thing as society
Thatcher's plans for taxes stank
So let's not go back to that;
But right now, the bankers are laughing
Right back to the bank and it's tragic
MPs need to stop spending expenses
On mending expensive fences, it's offensive to the senses
When it comes down to cash incentives
It's senseless how you splash out
But the comments about class are comments without class
There's not a doubt about that
People who need heating don't give a *bleep*
Whether you've been to Eton
They just want you keep them from freezing
In the bleakest seasons it seems to me that we're being cheated
When we see the sleaze who do we believe in?
You need to rethink your reasons
See, we need a leader, not a devious speaker
Eager to keep secrets beneath a veneer
Keeping people in fear for your career
Isn't the reason you're here, I need to to be clear:
We want someone that'll live up to his promises
Not rhetorical oratory delivered from his orifice
I know it's difficult in politics to run an honest ship
There's a lot of bollocks and a lot of spin
To be honest it's an honour list of onanists
More bothered with their image than the problems of the populace
But I promise this: if you stop grinning
And make it your mission to take criticism on the chin
You'll have the confidences of a lot
Who think that we're on the brink of an apocalypse

Let's stay positive
(That's just the way it is)
It can't be that bad
(Things'll never be the same)
It probably can be that bad, but
(That's just the way it is, ah yeah)
That's just the way it is
Rest in peace, Gordon Brown's carreer
Rest in peace
That's just the way it is
Do y'know what I mean?




 Banana
Banana, banana
Banana, banana
I fancy a banana

Ay, mankind's finest age
Will be when animals are no longer confined to cages (yeah)
So let's find a way, 'cause
A gorilla isn't a violent ape
Until you give it ammunition, trigger primal rage
Meaning your life's arriving at its final stage
Look, your spine'll break, that's what I'm trying to say
He can suddenly change from all sedate to more enraged
Than a horny Gigantopithecus from a prehistoric age
But his call of nature's way more than just to fornicate
More than brawn, more than brain
Born in jail and enslaved
All the same, saw a way
To maul and break the ball and chain

Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
All gorilla, no filler
Part guerilla killer, part nobel prize show winner

So when he's setting up a clever experiment ()
That's when this fellow's in his chemical element (yeah)
Does everything for the betterment of everybody
To be honest, there's no better buddy, 'cause he's bloody excellent (yeah)
If you're desperate for actual protection
Then I guess that it's the natural selection
No matter whatever you are
It's rare that you're really as hard as a gorilla in armour
We'll win in an instant when Winston's bananas
If you find you're in a dire predicament, don't rely on ignorance
Get the iron fisted scientist to try and fix it up
Normalizing vital signs and firing cylinders to silliness
This is survival of the fittest, gorillas are winning it
Come in his kingdom, killing his kinsmen
You're gonna take an L as big as Hillary Clinton
That's not cool, like calling a Native American an Indian
Or just living in Swindon
What's weirder than the appearance of Tilda Swinton?
All will be revealed, hear me tell the tale of Winston
He's a nutter, hugging a tub of peanut butter
Wrecking the base on any stage like he was Geezer Butler

Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
All gorilla, no filler
Part guerilla killer, part nobel prize show winner

You might find him in the lab (yeah), writing in a pad
Or outside going quite gorilla mad (rah)
Frightening the baddest of the fighters in the match
'Til they're begging for him to be nerfed
"We'd like another patch!" (eugh)
But it might come back to bite him in the ass
They still find they're coming last, they should try another class
Fact:
When Overwatch comes at you with a giant posse
You'll see gorillas in the midst, Dian Fossey
Doomfist was an opportunist
Ruthless, 'til Winston came along and gave the plot a new twist
Studying a lexigram to journey to the west and grab
A tesla cannon barrier projector, get the best of Talon
Genetically altered to wreck and never falter
Successfully setting up a drone to rock Gibraltar
For Overwatch, it ultimately led to their recovery
Imagination is the essence of discovery

Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
All gorilla, no filler
Part guerilla killer, part nobel prize show winner
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Woao!
Bananananananananananananananananas
All gorilla, no filler
Part guerilla killer, part nobel prize show winner

Banana, banana
Banana, banana
Banana, banana
Banana, banana
(Banana)
(Banana)
I fancy a banana




 We learned to band together and endeavor
Clasp our hands together
Man developed language, letters
An incredible advantage, getting plans together
But would we stand the test of time
Against the planet's reckless climate
And its angry weather?

Spread the sails
And head west against the gales
And storms aboard Norse longboats
With decks as dense as nails
Our aim was riding waves
And finding, claiming strange horizons
Invading islands
Native populations slain with violence
Enslaved and made to aim skyward
Think of bigger things - sphinxes, pyramids
Raise them high in the name of different kings
The different things we've held sacred, divine
Through places and times
The range of supplications and rites
Through ages we find
Nations arise
As old civilizations crumble to dust
Becoming strangers in time, waiting to die
Replaced in the night
The day breaks and the light changes
Illuminating newer human faces as fights rage
The human race is facing the might
Of righteous states who would write
The history books even if it took a knife's blade
To find the right page
Sengoku Jidai
Men offered to die
For the honor of a warrior's life

The sun's coming and we're watching it rise
As a new era's here, it's as solid as iron
Pull the tongs from the fire
Strike the hammer to the anvil
Craft a weapon to bring an enemy to a standstill
The blacksmith is the wizard that gives us
These powers - devour enemies
Leaping down from the siege towers
The better the tech is
The lesser the effort to wreck it
The less time to see their eyes
And feel sympathetic
Never regret it
A true knight never stays a true blade
Never says touché
But would forever lay in blue rays of weathered glades
To demonstrate his never-ending dedication
To the crusade
Reformation through flame
And after the cremation is a new age
Time's quill is quick to spill its ink onto a new page

The faces are the same as when in days gone
But brains are cultivated thus creating
The Renaissance
We're still using steel tools to stay strong
Replacing blades with greater trades
Pen and paper, song
Faith in God is tested, hiding in the desert
Men excited, then enlightened by the scientific method
Tried describing its expression
By inscribing his impression
When applying it to heavenly bodies
That everybody reckoned
Must have been made by a creator or a greater force
Nature's author faced examination never faced before
The grace of horse and rider
Replaced by wars and violence
Debased the laws of science
Made the case for all the pious
Why is it progress always leads to loads of mess
The western region spread across the globe and coalesced
Settlers spread disease with effortless ease
Was it reckless or did it just happen inevitably?
While evidently we never can see
Through the lens of this century
But there's no retreating now
Whether or not it was meant to be

The seven seas were sailed
Navies prevailed
Leaving trails of devastation in their wake
As people wailed
A world of wonder plundered traded in the name of progress
But human nature's way shows we should expect no less
Oh yes, struck by the realisation this is just civilisation
In the natal stages of industrialisation, trust me when I say
That previous achievements are just child's play
Compared to this colossal school of thought
We set the world ablaze with fossil fuel we bought
It's an epiphany
Giving us pretty much infinite energy
It's electricity
Edison, Nikola Tesla - different inventors
Giving us everything we depend on
Whether it's engines, cinema, television or telecoms
Sending a message and spreading it on
These unreal frontier channels
We develop the tech and then sell it on
The reel travels round
With the speed of a machine gun's barrels
Machinery's a meaner beast and we're still in the saddle
No need for cavalry - battle superseded that with ease
Allies and Axis
Charging each other like batteries
A power vacuum allowing the superstates to flourish
Redistribute the food even if it means people are malnourished
Propaganda is the only view that you're allowed to publish
Cause totalitarians are well aware of how to punish
Gunning down numbers countless
For doubtless nothings that they've done
But that won't stop subversive insurgents
From coming out with courage
Using their power to the fullest
Whether creativity or demonstrating general relativity
Evidently when we find time to be efficient
Einsteinian clear vision can reveal the precision behind the blinds
Nuclear fission
Despite derision
Physicists decide the mission is dividing, splitting atoms
'Till a blinding light is given, quite efficient
The divine right to mankind's plight is christened
A minor decision hijacked by politicians
But as long as they listen to the will of the people
Treat all as brilliant equals, we can achieve more
Than we've ever conceived before

Leave this poor place
Please explore space
Earth, she's a small base
Even more awaits
I implore great leaders
To lead with all the grace
Of which we're capable
And be the author of your fate
Band together and endeavour
Clasp our hands together
As our ancestors have
And stand the test of time forever

 Combat
Prepare for combat

Allow Mr. Bull to introduce you
To a soldier in the future
Who's been moulded and reduced
Into the coldest single shooter
In control of a computer
Since the last one, whoever that was
Was flatter than the default backdrop
On an old laptop
A soldier's silhouette glimmers in the distance
The electric light flickers
And he's missing in an instant
Sitrep:
You and your clique are going to get wrecked
For forcing me to write a rhyme
Where I mispronounce "Respect"
Testing my reflex
Is messing with a bee's nest
I suggest it'd be best to leave
Please be my guest
Receiving threats
But I don't even stress
How can I be grieving
When I don't believe in death?
You sneaky shoulder peeking spec
Come back and meet your nemesis
'cause he's a deeper threat
Than even NEMEXIS
You can count my kills, my deaths
And peep at dem assists
I'm not even prejudiced
I'm just a me supremacist

Combat
I dominate you
You're the low common denominator
Combat
I'll kick you constantly like I was an elite moderator

Achtung!
Engage Operation: Black Lung
Your obligation:
Bring the population back
From the grasp of a virus
Inside the shaft of a mine
There's more to be frightened of in the lack of light
Than massive spiders' appetites
We need to travel deeper
Reach the lab and grab the research
We're being attacked
The meagre shack is feeding cabin fever
Don't breathe the gas, we're leaving
After we can blast the bleeders
The gashes their slashes leave are scratches
Pass the tweezers
My first aid is first rate
Wrapping tourniquets
Round burst veins like burst mains
And you complain of shirt stains?
Err, mate
I just averted your fate
And turned it away
Gave you another birthday, so I'd say I'm deserving of cake
Served on a plate
But you're determined to hate
Trapped in a terminal state of permanent rage
If there's a Hall of Fame for jerks
You're earning a place
So save your breath, don't QQ
Get on the train and GTFO
Choo Choo!

Combat
I dominate you
You're the low common denominator
Combat
I'll kick you constantly like I was an elite moderator
Combat
I dominate you
You're the low common denominator

 Hello, my name's Daniel and I don't really see what's so special about this "no control" stuff
Let me put it in another way:

Kendrick Lamar did a verse and everybody's going crazy
Can somebody explain to me why it's considered so amazing?
All I hear's another rapper running his mouth
Seriously, tell me what the fuck the fuss is about?
How did rap get into such a sorry state?
Was it folly? Fate?
Or is it the fact that I've only just arrived? Sorry I'm late
I was busy refining my craft
Writing a rap
To strike and attack
Anyone who's ever spoke a line on a track!
I'm a frightening madman, the violentest chap
So please let's have a moment of silence as Dan drops the most violent of raps!
Every MC in the charts is a pile of crap
Most of you pussies still have your hymen attached
This fellow Kendrick's going to get ended
He raps like he's choking on his own vomit; Hendrix
It leaves me with a sour taste to acknowledge ya'
I'll straight up demolish ya'
Hey, Jay Electronica!
I saw you on "Crap Rappers Gone Wild"
The hottest thing you managed to put out is Kate Rotschild
I'm hostiler than a Rottweiler with rabies
Look at the state of Jay-Z
Man it's a shame, jeez!
Now he's reached the top of the game he's refraining
From saying things even vaguely interesting! Amazing
How he used to be the voice of people from the streets
Now he's the mouthpiece of a Korean phone company
Unbelievable
And if you believe I'm being unreasonable
I'd love to hear your contribution to this free-for-all
But I'm not seeking beef at all
I'm just speaking things we all
Ought to take on board
Shut up, Drake! I'm bored
Leave the door
Shut behind you on the way out
As I lay out
Juicy J
Take his inhaler away, ow...
Fuck Rick Ross
You're as hip hop as lip gloss
I'm a Brit posh
And still hit harder than this tosser!
Rap fans should be pissed off
At how they're ripped off
Major labels making pay from selling people this dross!
I came to change the game
Taking aim at famous names
Day to day
I blaze the lamest
Of you up in Satan's flames!
I don't care whether you burn on Hell or freeze!
Joel Ortiz
Can go to town on deez
Nuts!
I'm a beast that's
Come from out the blue
Every rapper on a major label: Run, I'm out for you!
Ha! It took a geeky prick like me
To show you how to do hip hop?
Well that proves you really need a sound that's new
So here I'll be hopeful
With a serious proposal:
Let's start talking about things that are real in our vocals
Social issues
Science, reason, actual feelings
On beats that are banging enough to smash the ceiling!
Now I don't know about you, but I think that's appealing
Bringing back the thing that rappers lack to bandage up the bleeding
They say the pen is more mighty than the sword
I say the way I handle mics is mightier than yours
It's indisputable that I'm the king of New York
And that's despite the fact I've never been to New York!
It's Dan Bull

I mean, I hope you understand my point there?
It's not difficult to just rap 50 bars and insult some people
It is slightly more challenging to touch people's hearts
To be honest
To connect with the world around you by confessing your weaknesses to it
I'm afraid of butterflies, that's my phobia
Butterflies!
Moths! Urgh...
Moths...




 I've lost my temper
I've lost my ring, my keys
I've lost my mind, I've...
I've lost my dignity
I've lost my voice
Lost my virginity
And now I've lost my train of thought too
Silly me
But then, I've done enough stupid things to last a lifetime
And by my track record, there's plenty more in the pipeline
I might drive without my lights shining at night time
I've lied, tried to hide my pride, started fights
I had no chance of me winning
Go back to beginnings
A new leaf, clean sheets
Pillow, mattress and linen
But I'm no master of living
I don't factor it in
I'm too busy daydreaming new ways
To expose facts that I've hidden
So instead of facing facts
I'm just making tracks
With a face that's glazed over
A vacant gaze
Shows the same range of problems
That are plaguing Jay-Hova
Make no mistake though
I aim to take over
Though that might be stupid
Do I give two shits?
No!




 Smash through the gates of the nuclear plant
Not just some dudes in a van, we're going through with a plan
Maximum impact's the thing that we're after
We're gonna bring back the Big Bang
Disaster

These guys are contriving a crime of the violentest type
We'll find them inside, we must deny them this crisis in time

Christ, there are five, so be quiet and hide

Because silence is vital when trying to surprise

You want to die or survive in the prime of your life?

Cause this moment your time to decide

Get ready to open fire and fight

But not 'til you spy the whites of their eyes

Nice
Got him right in the side with a sawed-off

Cripes
He well nigh blew my balls off
There's a sniper up high and we might be too late

I'll provide cover fire
You try to escape

Yo, lock and then load
You're about to die
Stop the bomb from exploding in Counter-Strike
I said, lock and then load
You're about to die
Stop the bomb from exploding in Counter-Strike

Boom! Headshot
Fock your mom
Aaaaagh, you dropped the bomb!

Mate what, come on

Make your move

Wait too long
Too late, you lose

Not so fast, man
Watch when I throw this

Holy crap! It's a flashbang!
Oh sh...!
I'll be laughing when you all die
Your number's up, M249

Agh!
He's got the aforementioned gun!
Take cover, aim another grenade

What the?
I set us up the bomb
Several seconds and it's gone

We'd better bloody run
They're wrecking it, come on

Fancy a cocktail?
I can make a molotov

Agh!
This is gonna burn the hair on my bollock off!




 It's the Bull, Dan Bull
With my mate Age, Sav-age
We're gonna go back in time now
Way back to when it was still socially acceptable
For an anthropomorphioc marsupial to wear high 

'Cause I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
Big red haired animal with pants and shoes
You don't really know me for my dancing moves
Now everywhere I go, they shout: Bandicoot!
I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
I said Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
Now everywhere I go, they shout: Bandicoot!

They call me Crash B-B-Bandicoot
Big red haired animal with pants and shoes
My genetics were enhanced in a lab
By two N. Sane scientists, I knew what I had to do
(Break free)
I've got to think quick and run
From the doctors and wow, I can spin, kick and jump
Running through the lab like a young George Best
I can reach a vortex, just three or four steps
Standing in my way I could see a forehead
My creator, my nemesis, Neo Cortex
He's a nearly bald man with a goatee
With a big 'N' on his head
And 'O' 'B' are the two letters that are kept in his coat, see
'N.O.B.' would look better for the slow readers
Running through the levels where rocks are rolling there
I'm dodging fire, riding on hogs and polar bears
And I haven't got a care when I grab an Aku Aku
'Cause you ain't gonna hurt me when
Udabaga
Thank you
There's lots to fear, see
I'm dodging TNT and boxes that are green
But wait, I've got to pause for a slo mo
Eyebrows up and down always, I'm loco
Man, I should be armed with a Go Pro
You can watch me while I'm searching for Tawna and Coco
I should be at a disco with friends
Instead I'm collecting these crystals and gems
No pistols or anything vicious
'Cause this is for kids, but us kids are now men
Equip me with anything, watch me come for you
My bazooka is shooting you with a Wumpa fruit
Forget your five a day, I got a hundred too
That'll puncture through you, you'll need a number two

'Cause I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
Big red haired animal with pants and shoes
You don't really know me for my dancing moves
Now everywhere I go, they shout: Bandicoot!
I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
I said Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
Now everywhere I go, they shout: Bandicoot!

My birth certificate says Neo Periwinkle Cortex
The best nemesis that ever did draw breath
Perfectionist, vivisectionist with a special gift
For resurrecting minions from any critters, pets and shit
But I bet I never win a nobel prize
I presume they've got a policy: No bad guys
If you don't know me, I'm the mojo thief
Giving loads of grief to boatloads of peeps
Because they're so beneath me, nobody sees
As deeply the scope of my rogueish schemes
In preschool I was the recipient of ridicule
Pretty please do tell me now: Who's the silly fool?
When I minimize the planet 'til it's miniscule
Making the Pacific Ocean fit into the kiddy pool
You're a little waste of energy, so I kilojoule
You must admit it, isn't being an evil villain cool?
If I look like a stereotypical bad guy
The reason is because I am one, that's why
But far more than a mere mad scientist
Rewiring household appliances
I am the vilest nihilist, tirelessly riotous
Fracturing alliances, confirming biases
Cultivating viruses, causing mild psoriasis
Yes I'm getting under your skin, like an itch
I am an antagonist, like Dan is to Savage
That's just how I cope with my emotional baggage
Do you know how it feels to have a head so massive
You can walk down the pavement and still stop traffic?
Remastered with Nil block graphics
Twenty years on and we still drop classics
The mic's real hot but I will not pass it
So go and shout it from the hilltops, Sav, it's

'Cause I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
Big red haired animal with pants and shoes
You don't really know me for my dancing moves
Now everywhere I go, they shout: Bandicoot!
I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
I said Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
I'm Crash
B-B-Bandicoot
Now everywhere I go, they shout: Bandicoot!

I rather enjoyed that
Do you know I never actually played Crash Bandicoot?
I pretty much just... reworded the Wikipedia article on Neo Cortex
So it rhymed a bit better
That's essentially my job




 And I don't know what it is but I think I like you
And I think I'd like it if you liked me too
And I don't know what it is but I think I like you
And I think I'd like it if you liked me too
And I don't know what it is but I think I like you
And I think I'd like it if you liked me too
Things are different since that you're there
This must be that thing they call love
My vision shift from grey to colour
This must be that thing they call love
Things are different since that you're there
My vision shift from grey to colour
This must be that thing they call love
This must be that thing they call love
It's been four or five years since we talked now but I
Never thought so high of any girl in all of my life
I thought you were gorgeous, warm and bright
You taught me all sorts and brought me to life
L'amour and more besides
When you spoke to my folks you were always polite
Though you always tried to hide that you were awfully shy
And how you'd always call me gorgeous was nice
I saw in your eyes I was more than just like
Some sort of ordinary guy of the ordinary type
It all just seemed right when you joined me at night
Then lay nattering, chatting and talking 'til light
I was that infatuated I could fall for you twice
We'd take lonely walks in August with Spice
Make phone calls and talk 'til morning sunrise
You were so great I thought you must have fallen from the sky
I couldn't wait for the day I could call you my wife
And gaze at your face through morning and night
Safely sailing away with my glorious bride
It's a shame that my mates didn't warn me in time
You were faithless and fake, it was all just a lie
You gave no warning, or a goodbye
You just stalled me, ignoring my calls and the like
So inform me - were you always unkind
Or did you morph to this poor form, absorbed in your spite
That liked to torture me with scornful calls, taunt me with guys
Flaunt them right by me and causing these fights
You were warping my mind with all of your lies
But I bet your side of the story's forty leagues from mine
Sure, you just sort of got bored of me, right?
Once the source of your light, now a thorn in your side
I'm a cautious guy so it tore me inside
It floored me forlornly cos I thought we were tight
I missed most of sixth form, withdrawn from my life
Spent all my nights smoking draw, drinking wine
When I saw you I'd go maudlin and cry
When I thought of you lying with some poor other guy
I had violent thoughts of all different types
And all through the times you would call me up crying
You didn't even inform me you were poorly or why
So of course I had a reason or a cause to be frightened
I thought I'd be caught in causing your suicide
So I pray for your sake that you sorted your life
But Christ, falling for you was an unfortunate choice
And yeah, I've been a wanker, I've been an arsehole
But leave it at that and the track's only half told
When I'm an old cold man with a hardened soul
I'll look back on the past as that when I had a heart of gold
But in my heart there's a hole
That you made, and it's taken ages to get the heartache controlled
It'd taken a hold, Taken its toll
Making me wholly incapable of attaining my goals
The strain of the whole weight on my shoulders
Is aching, my composure is breaking, I'm going insane, oh god
You were mine
And mine forever
A minor error
You were mine




 Yo it's Santa, put all your hands up
Damn, bruh
This rap track is a banger, standard
I'm grabbing all the ham in the hamper
Sipping cognac brandy right out the decanter
Riding my reindeer about at a canter
Grabbing Dancer and Prancer's antlers
Yank them about for the banter, wow man, I'm random
Handing bags full of bamboo to pandas
And I'm giving Bob Ross fans a new canvas
Is that a happy little cloud or a Santa?
Dang, it's the man with the fan club
From Hampshire to Japan, Uganda, Rwanda, Sri Lanka
Merry Christmas, happy Hannukah, Kwanzaa
As-salaam-alaikum, namaste, gouranga
Thank ya, or in Frankfurt: "Danke"
Because having good manners? That's gangsta
Got a lap dance from an Elf up in Lapland
Told me she's a bad lass, and I'd have to spank her
What's good for the goose isn't bad for the gander
Ho ho ho is the fat man's mantra
Oop, that's another scandal
I'll hand to my manager to handle and come up with an angle
Like I'm a really nice version of Abu Hamza
Snow hiding my dandruff
Don't come down a chimney, that'll land you in handcuffs
Sorry Dorothy, we're not in Kansas
Cancer's starting a stanza that's starker than Sansa
Or the seedier parts of Atlanta
Sex and the City cast: Parker, Samantha
Don't let them tell you that you can't, 'cause you can
And if the other kids in class say Santa's a sham
Tell them: That's fake news! Sad! Propaganda!
People are mistaken in believing that Australia's
Capital city's Sydney, it's actually Canberra
Jacksfilms, Dan Bull, assholes, cameras
Don't read the comments 'cause they're bad for your grammar
Reading all your letters and their spelling got me anxious
#YIAY, let Jack find the answers
I invented product placement, ooh, Fanta
That'll go well with a Chandler lasagne
Now I'm amped up, and that's just a sampler
Of sounds that I'm sticking in your hippocampus
It is a Christmas bonanza, extravaganza
And damn, it feels good to be a Santa (yeah)
Damn, it feels good to be a Santa




 From the fire
Only embers
Remain

The last log's on the bonfire, we should go on, Sire
Things have gone dire, pray the church has got a strong spire
I'm not pious, though I know the gods have one desire
To purify via shrines with a song of fire
Prepare to enter a harmful world of embers
Of half-remembered curses darker than the worst December
Forget your Christmas card, return to sender
We never light yule logs, we burn dissenters
Hurt them and dismember
Any wretched urchin who is too determined to surrender
Curb their temper through the nerve endings to the nervous centre
I swing a broadsword at a Lord of Cinder
And swipe left and right quick as if I'm bored of Tinder
And all it takes is tinder to scorch a wall of timber
The more you try to hide the stink, the more it lingers
Like trauma, muscle memory, and sores on fingers
It'll sting more than sticking splinters in your sphincter
Mortal men prepare for an awful winter where
There'll be more claret spilled than an awkward Vintner's wares
You'll fall hard as if I've kicked you down a set of stairs
Into infinite despair, so enter if you dare

Chilled fingers each rely on a spark
To ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark
Stoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart
Smoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart
Chilled fingers each rely on a spark
To ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark
Stoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart
Smoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart

The land of Lothric is gothic
Frothing with toxic, hypnotic, chaotic
Catastrophic stuff
And all you've got to stop it's what's in your pocket
Accurately calibrated, rapping at a frantic pace
In language antiquated, chanting pages of the dankest phrases
Chained dance with a dancer's grace, yours is a damned disgrace
I balance chance and fate with a straight stance and gait
Don't aggravate, I'll amputate and lacerate or strangulate
'Til I decapitate and your atoms evaporate
Emancipate your plasma from its cells, I'll incapacitate
And stab your face 'til it's as see-through as a sheet of acetate
As a simbol of your sinful ways I hang you from a meat hook
I'm unkindled like they took away my eBook
Even the darkest souls
Are merely parts of a whole
Molten pieces cast in a mold
He who's dealing the cards never folds
Keep on the path to your goal
Unroll a scroll and leave them charred into coal
Or dissolved into mulch in a hole out in the cold
And with the whole of your self full of holes
Oh! How does he do that?
Always coming up with a new rap
At a speed that's truly too fast
While keeping it true to the boom bap, true that
I don't mean to brag
I'm just making up for what you lack
Pulling myself up by the bootstrap
Difficulty curves need a new graph
I cherish the chance
To perish, advance
Correcting errors and vanquish terrors
That dance in embers at camps
Ephemeral phantoms vanish as I replenish my flask
Remember the past, then think ahead to the task, it's vast
Summon embers from ash
Slashing a veritable path through the Pantheon
The wrath of a champion

Chilled fingers each rely on a spark
To ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark
Stoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart
Smoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart
Chilled fingers each rely on a spark
To ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark
Stoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart
Smoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart

(Ash...)




 The Dragonborn returns to life
With awful burning eyes
To the hidden fortress
The time has dawned
To turn the tide
Return the prince's daughter
To the north across the water
Lean off my horse
And slaughter all
Before I pick a side
Do I take on the demon form
Beneath an evil storm
Feast on peoples' necks
As if their head's
Atop a piece of corn?
Or do I support the dawnguard
And ward the heartless darkness
Your fallen carcass torn apart
To ensure you're harmless?
I walk forward
Regardless of the peril
Feral my blades of glory'll
Gore an elf Will Ferrell
I've maxed the level cap
Stamina, Magicka, Health
Collected every shout
Successfully bettered myself
I've worked the perks
Earned a purse
Spent my septims
And now I'm heading out
It's none of your concern
But nevertheless
I can confirm
That yes I might become sunburt
My melanin's red
As the Whiterun sun turned
When I ready my crossbow
Your head'll be redder
Than central Moscow
I use so many bolts
I get them wholesale
From Costco
Action packed With Dragons
Smashing splashy patches
Bats and axes
Hacking you up
Haphazardly
Like medical malpractice
I am the Dragonborn
And I still wear the hat
With badass horns
I've fought swarms
Of forsworn hordes
And now I'm after more




 A
Ruined world
Hey
What you doing girl?
Looking for answers?
You look a bit anxious

You're far from shelter
(Careful)
It's harmful out there
Fighting violence and terror
Is trial and error
Grab a vine or a fibre
A wire and tie them together
So you're flying
As light as a feather
Climbing whatever
Climate or weather
'Til you're finding the treasure
Head straight to Meridian
What a place to create a city in
Chasing Elysium
Like an idiot taking the lithium
Aim for oblivion
I may be rephrasing an idiom
Saying the same thing again
Just to make it fit in
But i'm taking you primitive places
You may never visit
And making it...
SSSIIZZLING

Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn
Got a premonition and I fear those swarms
Will be here with no warning
Hear those horns
Don't pour scorn
On those that forewarn
Of snowstorms
Or you could go home forlorn
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn

Trudging through the over growth
The hunt's a drug i do
I'm floating close to overdose
My toes, my bones, my chromosomes
The moment's over, focus
Slowly sober, roaming over zones
Showing signs of tribes of old
Like roman roads are
Eroded
A ronin rode a rodeo
Rewrote the rule, we rowed a rowboat
Over rows of rapid river flows
Until it froze
The tiller throws us
And it goes off
'Til our goal just isn't close
This isn't supposed to be
The way the wind it blows
But when it blows, It leaves a breeze
That tends to throw the leaves of trees
To the extent we only see
In fevered dreams
See, believe
These machines
Steel beasts
When we beat them we'll feast
On meals of real meat again
We'll meet again
When he's deceased

Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn
Got a premonition and I fear those swarms
Will be here with no warning
Hear those horns
Don't pour scorn
On those that forewarn
Of snowstorms
Or you could go home forlorn
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn

I've
Got something to say
Don't take it in a sensitive way
There's no sense in taking offense
I'm saving a friend when i say
Pray
What kind of brave hunter is chased
Running away
To the hub of the cave
Thinking you're going to be safe
Nah
They're coming to take
Everything you're loving away
Whether humble or great
Man, it'll crumble and fade
Succumbing unto the grave
So come on under whether you're
Pulling a gun or a blade
Going to make the blood in my veins
Run at a pace that's unsafe
In an untamed rugged domain
What could it mean
I'm wondering who my mother could be
Was she
The same kind of woman as me
There's some kind of beast
Drumming a beat
I'm a machine
Like those steel beasts
When we beat them we'll feast
On meals of real meat again
We'll meet again when he's deceased
When he's been blessed with death
When east is east
And west is west
North is north
And south is south
I'm going in
Out and out

Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn
Got a premonition and I fear those swarms
Will be here with no warning
Hear those horns
Don't pour scorn
On those that forewarn
Of snowstorms
Or you could go home forlorn
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn




 Look I know it's not often it's a zombie apocalypse
But I've got a big blow nobody can soften it so
Without further ado let me disclose what it's urgent to do
To avert your certain doom
I urge your alertness to the words in the tune
The last survivors band together
Grab supplies, ammo, whatever
It takes to stay ahead of the others
And run from them Hell For Leather
There's bad manners in the Soviet bloc
People call and they don't even knock
I was brought up and thought people owe me a lot
But I learned very shortly I'm only a dot
In the sight of a scope of a rifle a blokes aiming
Right at my dome and I'm going to be shot
I'm going down quicker than the blood that I'm losing
Oh my God I've got to get a blood transfusion
How am I going to get it? Man, I better get moving
Before the other humans move in
The hammer in my head's getting madder and I'm woozy
Thought I heard a man shout "Friendly", Who's he?
Can I trust him? Or should I bust him?
Full of bullets, finger on the trigger and I'm gonna pull it

I shot a zed in the head
But he didn't die because he was already dead (x2)

I've got a backpack full of mad crap
Whatever you imagine I can craft that
Mags, maps, rags, raps
I can turn a gas can to a gas lamp
Gas canisters, magazines, bandannas and batteries
I'm an athlete, a survivor
Try attacking me, then I'll find ya'
This is a patch that's full of disease
So you could catch a bullet with ease
Death comes as a sudden release
For he or she that'll struggle to see the wood for the trees
I've never had such hunger for beans
And I've drunk everything from the canteen in my jeans
I've got to stay hydrated to make it
But I might die from the painkillers
At the rate that I'm taking them
A bit of bacon would be amazing
My veganism dissipated and I'm a carnivore
Starting wars, turn a bad situation to a carnival
You can't say that you aren't involved
The outbreak of the plague took part of your soul
Humanity's hard to keep hold of
After you've halted the heart of a soldier

This is a song that's self referential
By Dan Bull about a fellow called Deadpool
Both dead cool, both mental
Both use terms that are frowned on in general
We're giving you a heart attack
The proper medical term for that is "cardiac"
We put in 200%
You're probably only doing about half of that
Who's this beautiful dude doing martial arts?
Hey, where's Ms. Marvel at?
I'm the marvelous marvel of marvel you marvel at
Throwing marbles at marmosets
Wearing a tight black and red pajama set
Nomming marmalade because I'm Marvin, mate
And now I've got to dash because I'm rather late
For the hook in which I lazily chant my name

Dead to the Pool to the Pool to the Dead
If it doesn't make sense, well it's all in your head
Pool to the Dead to to Dead to the Pool
Ooh, bikinis, head to the pool
Dead to the Pool to the Pool to the Dead
If it doesn't make sense, well it's all in your head
Impressed mildly be you'll
Backwards this read
Bro, story cool

So scratch that Deadpool itch
Livestream it all on Twitch
Self referential kitsch
Auto-tuned to perfect pitch
Call women ho and bitch
Then repeat until you're rich
It's pronounced "niche" not "nich"
Oh no, YouTube just glitched
There's too much anger
Give me a chimichanga
I'm a chubby wanker
I can't read the signs well enough to see the danger
Oh, hang on, cheeky banter
And I'm fidgety, rowdy, skittish
Inexplicably sounding British
Round up critics that downvote this
And skip their life story to the finish
With so many fates to save the world from
Who will step to the plate?
Wade will, son
I make you disappear from the net like your name was...
I was running out of rhymes for Wilson
Even though I just had the opportunity to change it
I still said Wilson
And now I've done it again, we should probably bring the fills in

Dead to the Pool to the Pool to the Dead
If it doesn't make sense, well it's all in your head
Pool to the Dead to to Dead to the Pool
Ooh, bikinis, head to the pool
Dead to the Pool to the Pool to the Dead
If it doesn't make sense, well it's all in your head
Impressed mildly be you'll

Bro, story cool

This song is for sale
You have money
Go on
Treat Yourself
Have you noticed how many of Dan Bull's songs end really suddenly on the final word?




 There's dead on every street
The city's a cemetery
So evidently, you better believe
It's better to get up and leave
If that's something you'll ever achieve
Well then you will need to get a bit mean
With the endless sea, of horrendous beings
That'll see your flesh as a delicacy
They wanna find out how your meat tastes
One bite is all it takes
Should you make a small mistake
They'll make you their next gourmet steak
The stakes have been raised, son
Can you stave the invasion?
From the cradle, to the grave, you'll save
All walks of life and death, When you slay them

I'll make tools,Then I slay fools
Though I break rules, Stay faithful
To the label, Of a fellow cutting straight through you
From the nape of the neck to the navel
Maybe it's painful, maybe it's not
I dunno, your brains are all rotten
And though you may have forgotten the way that it was
I won't let you forget when I take you to god
With a home made blade aimed straight to your schnoz
I don't suppose, there'll be that much tissue left
To let you blow your nose
And so it goes on
The contagion continues
It'll blatantly take
Every grain of the patience
And latent frustration
That's waiting within you
Skill
Let's take it back!




 Mass panic (Where are we?)
Crash landed on a barren planet
Tau Volantis, God's sake, How romantic
Look out for Danik
The Unitologists are on a ship
And if you spot them then use your hollow tips
While human colonists seek the codex key
Who's the musicologist's new foe? That's me!
Rewriting rhyme science, Isaac Clarke
My lines shine like eyes in the dark

Mines in the vast reaches of deep space
Are the reason that I came to be in this bleak place
But to keep my spirits up I keep lacing the beat
With words that deserve a million replays
Til I beat the game on every difficulty
Pitifully, leaving you amazed, at my skill
Now could we open the electric doors
And let me get debauched
With the Necromorphs
Until the Nexus falls
I bet you've all
Never seen a pair of balls
As heavy as my testicles

I walk the walk, I'm one of the nastiest trash talkers
Attack Crawlers and Swarmers, blast Stalkers
I go berserk at Lurkers
Turn them into burgers
I murder Pukers
Use their mucus as a gherkin in a bap
Amidst the battle I'll be working on my rap
To refute your version of the facts
Plasmatic fluid all curdling
I'd ask you to call and inform Planet Earth I'm coming back
To stack astronomic fees as a music producer
And you? You're stuck at Zero G's, Medusa
God Is Dead...Space
Thus Spake Zarathustra




 Dear Anjem Choudary

So you've been writing open letters, I write them aswell
But I'm polite and don't threaten the fires of Hell
So save your sermon for others
Not a person that's just lost a serviceman they loved lots
My brother lost a good buddy, Robbie
You won't convert his mother
You'll just turn public opinion to thinking you're a worthless bugger What on earth are you going to achieve in grieving
The recently bereaved? It seems pretty mean to me
It's a useless tactic using Wootton Bassett
And with such a blunder, no wonder you're viewed as a fanatic
I hate to be rude, but the fact's clear and loud to me:
You could use some class, Mr. Choudary
How many people do you think you're going to convert
When recently you've seemed to be a bit of a berk?
Most of these are just kids, they're not the warmongers
The decisions are made by politicians, they should face your criticism
There's better ways to raise awareness of Muslims' plights
Like look at Lowkey, he's doing something right
He self-released a song for Palestine and Gaza
And now the track's reached number one in the Amazon charts
And people are listening, taking it on board
And not retaliating with hateful scrawls on Facebook walls
It takes some balls to spread a polemic message
But it takes brains to ensure everyone gets it
I want to see these countries free from military and killing
I want to see stability
So if your protest goes ahead, I hope there's no stress
But don't be surprised that in the people's eyes you're hopeless
Dan Bull




 Dear Auntie Beeb

Don't take away our radio
We need a place - a place to go
Where we can play our favourite shows
Don't take away our radio

When I first heard the word about BBC 6 I thought
"This is absurd, is the BBC sick?"
It rocked the airwaves enough to keep me seasick
But it's the first to get sunk - can we believe it?
And I thought pirates were meant to be the problem
But obviously not 'cause your lot's already got some
Doctor, doctor, what's your option
What are you going to drop from the roster to cost cut?
The Asian Network plays the best work
Of a strain of the nation that strains to get heard
And now you're severing the nerves of a massive demographic
It's not a very clever tactic, is it?
The last bastions of unsigned action
Independents depend on it for traction
Ask Lamacq or Bobby Friction for his reaction
My prediction isn't one of satisfaction
Do the maths, it's a simple subtraction:
Take away the stations and you chase away the talent
Listening figures isn't your biggest purpose
It's first and foremost to provide public service
I'm not saying other stations are worthless
But adverts are adverse and make me nervous
We deserve to have a say in what we'd like to see
I mean after all, we pay the licence fee

Don't take away our favourite shows
Don't take away our radio
Don't take away our favourite shows
Don't take away our radio

You need to appeal to the people that feel John Peel
And want to keep it real
So please, pretty Beeb, we appeal for a new deal
We'd be pleased if the spiel was repealed
D.B. sees what's needed to escape from the danger zone:
More DAB radios in the nation's homes
The audience is there, they just need connecting
In the same way your arrangement needs correcting
Next thing on the list that's vexing
Bloody everybody is you spending money like it's never ending
Even a yellow bellied Teletubby could tell us it's crazy
Laa-Laa; Lady Gaga
Pay me half of what you pay to Clarkson
I'll be laughing like I can't keep a straight face, straight up
If there's a budgetary deficit to make up
Then wake up and give Big Jeremy a pay cut

Don't take away our favourite shows
Don't take away our radio
Don't take away our favourite shows
Don't take away our radio

There's enough talent out here for like forty channels
But we only get to hear the top forty sellers
You're running it like Basil does to Fawlty Towers
Literally - ask Andrew Sachs, he could talk for hours
About how he was pushed about as Manuel
Then Johnny Ross and Russell Brand did it as well
Man, Johnny Rotten wouldn't slag the living Hell
Out of an old man's grandkid on his cell
Well, if Russell Brand and the six million dollar man
Are the cream of the crop then you can hang the DJ
* Radio 1 - sweet for teenagers
* Radio 2 - great if you're really ancient
* Radio 3 - for those of a refined taste
* Radio 4 - all talking and giant brains
* Radio 5 - only sport fans are tuned in
* Radio 6 - it's the music we're losing

Don't take away our radio
We will complain until you know
It's a mistake - I'm afraid so
Don't take away our radio




 Dear Joseph Alois Ratzinger, Pope Benedict the 16th, Bishop of Rome, Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City and formerly Archbishop of Munich and Freising, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and Dean of the College of Cardinals

I'm not a Catholic
But I'm a chap that thinks
Some of your actions stink
And want to ask some things
Will mister Ratzinger listen to a rap singer?
Maybe - in the past he listened to that chap Hitler
Sorry, I couldn't resist, back to buisness;
Back in te habit like Lauryn Hill in Sister act is
Did you ever see that flick? It's fantastic
I can lend you the VHS if you fancy it
Damn, I'm rambling
Damn I didn't meen to say "damn"
Damn, I just said "damn" again
I'm a bit anxious I'll be tagged as discriminatory
Similarily to your religion's history
I know what it's like to have a stigma stick to you
You were in the hitler youth
I was in the local scout troop
'til the parent found out that Baloo
Liked bare Cubs a little more than he should do

And that's what I'd like to discuss with you
The sick stuff some kiddy fiddlers are into
It's like sometimes you're less inclined to find the truth
Than to hide the abuse under your roof
You're quick to stick it in when other people sin
So why are you so unwilling to take this one on the chin?
You might think that it isn't my business
But you're into forgiveness, so forgive this:
Your hollow apology bothered me horribly
It'd probably be better if you'd not said a fucking thing
My God, I just swore at the Pope, I'm so sorry, honestly
Now that's an apology
Not just promising to modify your policy
Moderately to smother the controversy you've often seen
It's sick, depraved system failure
It isn't just as if it's "misbehaviour"
You find out you're hiring a kiddie rapist and you don't even make a criminal complaint, it's insane
If this was any other organisation
You'd be taken straight down the station to make a statement
Now not all papists are rapists
And the clergy isn't permanently pervy but face it:
There's a disproportionate amount of cases;
It's almost as if they happen on a daily basis
You're the Holy See's head of state and
Loads of people want to see your head on a plate
Now I won't go that far,but it's fair to say
That from this day
Things better change

Jesus preached: love one another
But it seems some priests just want to bugger
Jesus preached: love one another
But it seems some priests just want to bugger
Some priests just want to bugger
Some priests just want to bugger




 This is a love letter to Hillary Clinton

Oh Hillary
I do not know why you are pilloried
You're the biggest woman in America but Lady Liberty
Just 'cause you're slithery it doesn't make you a snake
Everyone has made a mistake
Modern communications are full of complications
It's getting more confusing to refute these allegations
Be it botched operations or personal relations
You prefer to avert investigation
On who's to blame within Clinton's administration
Or why you rehired Debbie Schultz after her resignation
So before the conversation gets any more derailed
Hit me up, I sent my details to your email
You could be the Meg Ryan to my Tom Hanks
A corporate Bonnie and Clyde but we won't rob banks
We'll head to Wall Street and we'll help the banks rob
Be it for a backhander or a handjob

Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
Pushing the boundaries of plausible deniabillity
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
I can't wait the anticipation is killing me
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
Like her leadership would be any better than Bill would be
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
I can't wait the anticipation is killing me

The world is getting worse lately
Baby girl, save me
In return I'll pay the parking ticket for your Mercedes
You make me stir crazy, the former First Lady
Showing that women are able to do more than birth babies
Are you an angel from above? Are you our salvation?
Or are you that woman from 101 Dalmatians?
Restoring glory to your once proud nation
I just pray you run it better than you ran the Clinton foundation
The GOP try to paint you as a harpy
Hardly, you're part Dana Carvey and part Barbie
If you be my Lizzie Bennet, I'll be Darcy
We could honeymoon over in Benghazi
Go on safari, avoid any inquiry
About your dodgy business dealings with shady Svengalis
We'll go whitewater rafting right after we've rammed out pockets
Thanks to the new staff at the White House travel office

Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
Pushing the boundaries of plausible deniabillity
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
I can't wait the anticipation is killing me
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
Like her leadership would be any better than Bill would be
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
I can't wait the anticipation is killing me

You weren't always a Democrat
Back in '64 you campaigned Republican - Remember that?
Or are you having another convenient memory lapse?
Why am I even asking? You won't remember any of that
But you left a paper trail - better clean the ink spots up
And get rid of the suicide letter of Vince Foster
He knew a lot, you took a shot at him and then he died
But I'm not implying that you've got anything to hide
I couldn't sleep at night, I was having bad dreams
'Til Hillary came and sprinkled me with dank memes
She's down with the kids, she's lit, not a has been
It's Hillary and Billy C - the classic tag team
Thank God you're back, Hillary, I thought you might retire
You've already suffered humiliation and sniper fire
It brings a tear to my eye, grab a tissue
While the DJ flips the record like you did on the gay marriage issue

Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
Pushing the boundaries of plausible deniabillity
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
I can't wait the anticipation is killing me
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
Like her leadership would be any better than Bill would be
Vote for Hillary
Vote, vote for Hillary
I can't wait the anticipation is killing me

Yours sincerely, Dan Bull




 Dear Lily Allen

Remember when you pretended, Lily
That you were truly independent, Lily?
Faking like you made it all alone
But you were legally with Regal, part of Parlophone
Oh yes
So when you lectured me
I thought I'd fileshare my thoughts on your MP3, Lily
Now first I must sing your praises
I love your singing but I'll just say this:
I saw on your MySpace pages
Saying filesharing's a new ice age, but the
Industry's a recent innovation
Music's been alive, thriving since cavemen
Folk songs so long have had a place in
Communities that you should be amazed at it
Then one day came intellectual property
Meaning if I think a thought, you can't copy me
And if honesty's the best policy
I'd say songs are better off without this monopoly
It'd blatantly be a major fail
If they'd patented the major scale
And downloads don't equate to sales
So taking them away won't make me pay up
Just procludes me from sending your tunes
To my friends, so we all lose in the end
You lose potential fans and we lose
Respect for the fact that you're desperate for cash
But what do you expect from the lass
Who's collecting a fat bank cheque from the man
While her fans are collecting the glasses
For minimum wage they'll spend on her tracks?

Dear Lily, why are you being this silly?
Yours sincerely, Dan Bull
Dear Lily, why are you being this silly?
Yours sincerely, Dan Bull

Now please don't be offended, Lily;
I think your new CD's splendid, Lily
Everybody's At It and it's Not Fair
I Could Say, The Fear was Him but He Wasn't There so
Let's go Back to the Start, before 22 -
All music's in the public domain, so Fuck You
It's never the amateurs that's reckon it's damaging us
It's the major labels saying it's fatal;
Like when Napster had to pack up, wrecked by Metallica
The table's turned now - the labels churn out
A new Jezebelinternetelevangelist - and she's fit
With a manuscript that was actually written by Mr. Michael Masnick
Can you get the irony? And by the by, Lily
I like this beat - I hope you don't mind me thieving
Cause even doing a cover song's decried as stealing
But it's alright, still, for you to plagiarise, and preach it -
Don't you believe it's maybe time to rethink, Lily?
Put music back in the hands of the people;
Make the majors and amateurs equal
If anything, labels strangle the freedom
You claim they're saving by banning this evil
That's the actual reason, you see;
And please don't compare sharing to stealing -
I've not took anything off you
I'm just spreading love for what you do
Downloaded your songs for free
Then I bought my mom your CD
She likes it too, she keeps telling me
All because I pirated an MP3
Now I've got Matt Bellamy belling me
Telling me I'm not a fan, I'm the enemy
That's amusing, I've paid enough to see Muse in
My time I could buy them a museum
Did you see them on that programme miming?
Yeah, the pirates are killing live gigs
Maybe we should have a ban CDs appeal -
Then people would pay to see bands for real

Dear Lily, why are you being this silly?
Yours sincerely, Dan Bull
Dear Lily, why are you being this silly?
Yours sincerely, Dan Bull
Dear Lily, why are you being this silly?
Yours sincerely, Dan Bull
Dear Lily, why are you being this silly?
Yours sincerely, Dan Bull

And I don't mean any offence or anything, Lily
I just don't think the issue's as clear cut as you're making out
And I know you're going to carry on making music really
But when you're between the devil and the deep blue sea
You need to stop worrying about pirates, and adjust your sails




 Dear Peter Mandelson

I've been following your recent policy proposals
So now they've gone through, I thought I'd contribute some vocals
The focal point of my criticism's
The ridiculous decision to bring in a system where you flick a switch and
Disconnect the internet when it's suspected
That intellectual infringement has been detected
Even if the relatives they live with definitely didn't
I think it's in your best interest to bin this, yes?
'Cause isn't it a respected institution
That we're considered innocent unless different is proven?
Er, excuse me - how can you excuse exclusion
When you've not pursued a definite conclusion?
You're picking on the little man, the Lilliputian;
Now there's a pain in my gulliver and it's confusing
You're swift to treat your citizens with such little human humour
It's no wonder that we're disilliusioned
This resolution's gonna end in revolution
Just like any other governance that doesn't accept evolution
To be perfectly honest, m'lord, there'd be less intrusion
If you curtly abolished the law and left us to it
And why do games require safety ratings
But any age can see adult-aimed plays and paintings?
It's state censorship, the same as Beijing;
But even China thinks a pirate isn't worth the time of day for chasing
I think Chairman Mao would say the same thing
Since you became secretary, it's like the state's your plaything
You made a massive sacrifice, invaded loads of privacy
But if I wanted to download, there'd be no hope of finding me
I could take my mobile phone to the local library
And utilise the free wireless to find the file I need
Then what are you going to try - to disconnect their ISP?
You might as well just burn the books on rights to speech

Who'll profit from the Digital Economy Bill?
Not the public, but the profiteers probably will
Who'll profit from the Digital Economy Bill?
Not the public, but the puppeteers probably will
I've talked about how intellectual property kills
And you're still just concerned with who's copping the bill
It's quite obvious you've been lobbied
Until the copy holders got control, and you're probably their shill
It's not your problem when you're positioned on top of the hill
In your property that probably cost a couple of mil
But wake up and smell the coffee, the milk is going off
And you're not bothered 'cause your coffers are filled
Lord, it's time you took an honesty pill
And acknowledged the majority aren't horribly thrilled
So what if I watched a torrented comedy film?
I don't need to now my country's just become a Brazil
You know the truth, Orwell spoke his views
Your House broke the news and all Hell's broken loose
The utopia we hoped for is overdue
So could you help out a little bit and don't be stupid?
The onus is on you to show us
You aren't using your throne in a way the voters don't approve
I know you're very close to David Geffen
So maybe his interests have given you a hazed perception
Hey, do you reckon you'd win today's election
Considering you're chasing this amidst a great recession?
Deception's the politician's favourite weapon
But we're already jaded from one too many painful lessons

Dear Mandy
Stay away from my family
Yours considerably angrily
Dan Bull
Dear Mandy
Stay away from my family

 Dear Microsoft
Hi, I'm Dan Bull, I write rap verses
And this track's about your quite crap service
You've supposedly done countless improvements
So tell me how come that now it is useless?
What's the ground for bringing out all this new stuff
If it's not as good as 2002 was?
Your latest upgrade won't allow me to do what
I used to be able to do without an issue whatsoever
You're obviously not so clever
If you reckon this development makes software better
An elementary mailbox is all it's meant to be
But there isn't a single thing to more effectively
Enkindle the raw intensity of Dan's rage
Than accessing my messages to get given a blank page
No matter how much I refresh it, it's the damn same
It's like I'm the victim of a whiteout campaign
I down the champagne when it finally opens
Only to find it's too late and my ties are broke
It's urgent but trying to reply's just hopeless
It would have been quicker just to write and post it
A service so unreliable is unviable
It's undeniable so trying to have me done for libel
Is undesirable, I'd provide you with the details
In an email but you wouldn't find it because
A) It wouldn't arrive at all
And B) I couldn't write it anyway 'cause there's so much of it, it's undescribeable
I would like a refund for all the wasted time that you give me
Is this what you mean by The New Busy?
I'm too busy now, my day's too stressful
Not cos I'm successful but cos Hotmail's dreadful
It's leaving me feeling off-kilter
Immune system weaker than your spam filter
And what's with the file transfers on MSN?
I tried to send a picture to my best friend
Dragged the link into the window but it got all compressed then
I'm not impressed. 640 by 480?
I thought these days shit was all HD
I don't need a "paste this to Facebook" facility
Just a faithful communication utility
Silly me for thinking the ability to link is
Pretty obligatory in this day and age but
That's yet another thing you dicks have disabled
Now I have to click away to bring a seperate page up
Select the link, copy the text and then paste
What the F MSN are gonna do next
I'll never guess except I bet it's a mess
Cause every change that's made by the boffins is another fail nail in the coffin
I've been trying to stay away from the Gmail doctrine
But unless it gets better then I'm left with no option




 Dear Miley
My name's Daniel (Hi)
I've never really been a big fan of yours
I'm a musician too, amateur
But anyway, let me tell you what I am here for
You want to take a hammer to Hannah Montana
And vanish her
That is a plan I would have as your manager
But the manner that you're handling
It's going to damage you
Never underestimate the power of the camera
Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose
I said, Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose

Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose
(2x)

Yeah, I know girls just want to have fun
But Cyndi Lauper never flaunted her bum much
See, you're in a funny position
Every time you speak, young girls listen
They want to be like you, different
So they copy your moves and lose innocence
I tried twerking, it wasn't working
My balls kept slapping my thighs and it was hurting
There are blurred lines between empowerment
And the first time people seeing down the front of your dress
Not to mention the rest
Sometimes being censored is best
This is just a guess, but I'm sensing there's stress
You're either a diva or sensitive mess
Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose


My God, have you heard what she's done? (What now?)
I don't know, but I bet her tongue popped out
One day when the cheeks of your bum drop down
You'll have nothing left but your lungs and a hot sound
Right now, you've got pop locked down
But come middle age, you'll be washed out
I don't want to hear you've lost out for some quick dollars
The way the industry's treating people, it's bollocks
I see the wrecking ball as a metaphor
For what could happen to you during the menopause
When applause dies out, there is then a pause
And then you wonder what you acted like a lemon for

Sinéad O'Connor
She ain't your momma
But she doesn't deserve to have the piss taken of her, no
(2x)

See me, I'm really pretty good with words, but
I managed this without ripping my shirt off
I've tried a few stunts, but not this
How seriously can you take me when I'm topless?
Mmm, yeah I like it
I'm better at music now
How else could I act for additional hits?
I could hold up a cat while I jiggle my tits
Look at my boobies, look at my boobies
You'll see a heart
If you look straight through these
This isn't the movies or Looney Tunes
We are stuck with decision that we choose in our youth, see
Look at me, man, I'm standing in my pants
Don't I look silly when I'm doing this dance?
And I pull a face as if I'm pooing my pants
I want a long-term career, but I've ruined the chance


Of course, you're under no obligation
To pay any attention to those observations
But living a life with no moderation
Will lead to a load of complications




 This is a love letter
To Donald Trump

You're a cold mack, Donald
A role model
For the entrepreneurs
Who don't mind being called horrible
You're better than Donald Rumsfeld
And Donald Duck
Donald Pleasance, Glover, Sterling
Sutherland and Ronald Mc
If you weren't rich
Then you might well have been handcuffed
But instead of "guilty"
You can just cry "Bankrupt"
Give yourself a quarter billion salary
And build aeroplanes with gold plated lavatories
It's only fair that you get fair pay
To keep the economy afloat by buying hairspray
Yeah, cray
Pile on the layers of spray tan
'Til you have an excuse for being mistaken for Satan

I wanna hump Donald Trump
Put my thumbs on his rump
Then pump
Trump
For president
Trump for president
Vote Donald J. Trump
For president
Whatever anyone cleverer says is irrelevant
Just vote Donald J. Trump
For president

You're the landlord of the fellow that played John McClane
Now there's a real hero
Take note, John McCain
Donald knows how to keep the oil price low:
Find out what they're asking for it
And just say "No"
See Trump debunk the hoax of global warming
If it was true his walk-in freezer would be thawing
Evidence is boring
Whereas dogmatic thought isn't
So vaccination is the blatant cause of autism
Driving farmers out of their family homes with force
Why? To build a fucking luxury golf course
Of course
It's par for the course, some find it coarse
You can't please everyone
Ivana divorce
Men and women can't work together
Segregate the military
Everything'll be better
'Cause men are rapists, they can't help this
And it's a well known fact women are helpless
They're too pretty to risk military service
Thank Trump for Miss USA to give them purpose
They do it for the Donald
For the Donald
Let's do it for the Donald
The Donald, the Donald

I wanna hump Donald Trump
Put my thumbs on his rump
Then pump
Trump
For president
Trump for president
Vote Donald J. Trump
For president
Whatever anyone cleverer says is irrelevant
Just vote Donald J. Trump
For president

You know how to make America great again
You're used to being in debt
And then just starting a new slate again
File another Chapter Eleven
And to refill your wallet
Sue a journalist for several billion dollars
Other men in your shoes might choose to retire
But if any of your suggested that to you
Then they'd be fired
Bring back the death penalty
Executioners are MLG
Black lives don't matter if I reckon they're guilty
Hey, that's not a racial attack
Like Donald says
He's got a great relationship with the blacks
And what he lacks in tact
He packs in stacks of cash
Land grabs and manly pats on the back
Donald Trump can break a man
Simply by shaking hands
Donald Trump can break a bank
Simply by making plans
Throw your bankrupt companies in the air
And pare that debt like you just don't care

Trump
For president
Trump for president
Vote Donald J. Trump
For president
Whatever anyone cleverer says is irrelevant
Just vote Donald J. Trump
For president
I wanna hump Donald Trump
Put my thumbs on his rump
Then..

It's the Republican pundit
Pummeling, punishing
Not pulling punches, pumping up the public
And the publishers are loving it
You're bringing fanatical fringe feeling to the forefront
With the fab fringe of a bloody Liverpudlian
Take a little sprinkle of rhetorical eloquence
That is as nebulous as that mess of follicle negligence
Blend a bit of venom and pretend that you're intelligent
And what do you get?
To be the next president
You impressed us and blessed us
With your excellence
So we request that you prevent a pestilence
Of pesky Mexicans
We need a reckless non son of an orangutan
To rescue America from ending up in excrement

I wanna hump Donald Trump
Put my thumbs on his rump
Then pump
Trump
For president
Trump for president
Vote Donald J. Trump
For president
Whatever anyone cleverer says is irrelevant
Just vote Donald J. Trump
For president

Yours sincerely
Dan Bull




 Dear George
This may seem a little premature
But let me inform and reassure you what I'm here for
See:
There's three of four MCs I simply adore
And I can't really afford for them to be ignored
They rap with purpose, challenge your belief and more
Than scratch the surface, Grand Wizard Theodore
You see, I hear you perform
And then I feel all tingly and warm
Like these things are seeing porn
Therefore:
I thought it'd be mint if we recorded
So if you want to do this thing, give me a call, it's
Another pale kid sitting in his bedsit
Spinning syllables in a ball, it's a head trip
I want to give props, though I'm not often a dick sucker
And it isn't often that I kiss butts
Yes, but it isn't often that I hear lyrics bringing this stuff
So let me pucker my lips up and give love
Your subtle lisp just gives a certain crispness
To your presence, like red ribbon at Christmas
You lyrically bring a vision, images and pictures
To widen the line of our sight like strabismus
Listeners reminice for the time
Rap was a little bit deeper than just the meniscus
You must have missed or dismissed this missive
That insists on simplistic lyrics to get hits
'Cause our business is a harsh mistress
When MCs receive more spins than a discus
But the chips don't stack quick, I'm left listless
So I might just get down with the thickness
But hold on, there's another way
Watch, see?
You can be a geek like me, Watsky
Or any other bugger keeping it real
With stuff for people to feel
Regardless of if it leads to a deal
The secret to really having fun for yourself
Is to differentiate between money and wealth
I spent years trying to be somebody else
And then I realised it wasn't good for my health

Rap's in need of a bit of positivity
So maybe a love letter is a good place to start
'Cause I love letters (hah)
Hey George, George
Isn't rap fun?
It's like weaving a tapestry of language
I luv it
Why don't more people do this?
Imagine if the great musicians, playwrights, poets of the past
Had this technology at their disposal
What would they do with it?




 We called it the Traveller
The Light that had brought us from blackness
To widen, explore other planets, us
A tiny fault on our planet’s surface
Alive and reborn and expanding thus
We must try to be more than our ancestors
So let’s rise before we’re turned back to dust
And fight the force that unravelled us
Redefine our whole existence
Colonise the Solar System
Set our sights on the skies up high
And find the stars our roles are written in
Magnificent, munificent
Giving a gift to the citizens who wish on them
Lifting them up from indifference
Shifting them into significance
A Golden Age...
To control your fate is all the rage
Flip the script, fold the page
This is it, behold the stage
We’ve made the maps but face the facts
Everything great we’ve attained just may collapse
The Collapse has taken our cake away
And we aim to take it back
Any alien race invading our space
We’re making them pay for that
So raid, attack in waves
We’ll aim at your face and blast away the mask
Or take an axe and hack away ‘til we break your back
Grenades and flak won’t chase us back
We’re built to stay in the Milky Way’s new neighbours’ spat
We came from caves and paved the way to today so hey, perhaps That indicates the fact this teensy race adapts, we’re made to last!
The worse our circumstances, the more certain the chance is
We’ll stand resistant, persistently grin in the face of hostility
And live!

Now this is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the pack

Look!
Guided by the Light we fight the Darkness, so try to start shit
You’ll see the real reason why we can’t be sparred with
The Guardian ranks are highly advanced
Full body armour, no cardigan thanks
Our armoury’s crammed
Fully stocked with rockets, dropships, SR3s and tanks
My blood be pumping, like I’m bungee jumping
Feel the drum keep thumping, like a humvee’s frontpiece rumbling
No fronting, I’m confronting
Sunk drinks, and now I’m drunk
And I want to get a punch in on something
Pull you limb from limb
Pop off the top of your cranium like a pumpkin
Slam dunk it, in the dustbin
So don’t just run, sprint!
‘Cause I’m coming and I’m running and gunning
And I’m a gonna leave you looking like a dumpling
Dum sim, dim sum
I’ve done things, and then some
I’ve seen some things you wouldn’t believe
Even if I took a picture
The Exo vex the Vex so the Awoken will leave the Ogres broken
I’ll give the Cabal a kick in the balls, the Fallen will fall once more
Thralls all on the floor, got a Goblin hobbling
So that Phogoths say “oh gosh”
They won’t want to step out of line
Or so help me, I will go out my mind
I’m a mastermind, attack the Hive
Black the eye of an Acolyte
That smarts, you don’t have to fight to have smarts
But you’ve got to have that to fight
I speak on behalf of my species
And defy you to get the best of me
I’m owed success and will accept no less
It is my destiny!

Now this is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the pack
Now this is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the pack

Earth? We’ll be taking it back
Mercury? Taking it back
Mars? We’re taking it back
Venus? We’re taking it back
Saturn? We’re taking it back
We’re taking it back!
Aliens, they can attack
We’ll raise the stakes and erase the Collapse
Sharp as the blade of a razor
And fast as a hummingbird’s heart
That’s been tazered and caffeinated
Then taped and played back insanely fast
Ha! Made you laugh
I’m keeping your spirits up, never give it up
Whoever’s giving you jip, never give a fuck
Approach this trial with an open mind, feel the flows and rhymes
Glow just like the Awoken’s eyes, it’s closing time
No scope and snipe any Crotan Hive
From Mercury’s ruined gardens, to the swamps of Old Chicago
We will reclaim our homes once more with bravado
Though it may be hard, hope is the fuel that burns our fire
That’s why we’ll fight ‘til we win or die, we won’t retire
That’s why we’ll fight ‘til we win or die, we won’t retire

Now this is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the pack
Now this is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the pack




 Zavala:    Look around you
The Galaxy's greatest Guardians gathered
Though times are dark
It is the light inside your heart that matters
You are the final line, mankind relies on for redemption
Cayde-6: Attention!
Woah, tough crowd
Okay, let me break the tension

Cayde-6: You're a rebel of reprobate
But there's no one else left that's capable of taking on
The great threat we face, and then staying to mop up
The mess they've made
Zavala:     Yes they layed siege to our motherland
Our precious home, I saw it all
And fought amongst the falling rubble
Deflecting endless blows
Cayde-6: They kept on coming, so my gun kept humming
You should've come and seen it
It was really quite something
I looked so great, so good
In a tide, in a cape, in a hood, it was rather inspiring
I side eyed a few girls admiring
Why you suprised? I'm so fine it's tiring
Anyways I'm getting sidetracked
Let me go and get a pint
Pinky promise I'll be right back
Zavala:     Despite the sacrifice of our finest guardians
We could not stop the scarlet army rising
From the ashes of the darkness
The tower fell, the city rushed
Our homes are crushed to dust
Cayde-6: Plus my stuff, now I was salty before
But now I've had just enough
Cayde-6: I mean who does this stuff?
It's unproductive, plus
My stuff!
So we're gonna look for the chump responsible
And fffluff him up!
Zavala:     And so today we know the name of the heinous foe we
Face
They call him
Cayde-6: Gavin?
No Gary
It's Gary isn't it?
Zavala:     They call him Ghaul
His only goal to cause a fall of all we've fought for
And war till there's nothing at all
When the Cabal is at the door you look for my support
But this time I call on yours
Cayde-6: You're probably gonna end up pretty sore
Cayde-6: These armor plates, they kinda chafe
Till your thighs are aching, rubbed really raw
Sh! All this tech and we still haven't developed
Any military drawers that'll win us any wars
I've been wearing these ones for months!
Zavala:     The time is now at hand
To avenge the injustice thrust upon us
In our final stand
Cayde-6: I'm a nice guy, so I shan't tell a white lie
Look, you might die
But then again, you might survive
So like every guide of advice, see the brighter side of life
Zavala:     I ask you: who'll rise and keep aside my side and fight?
Cayde-6: No hide and seek, dab on the haters
Everyday bro, ride or die!
Cayde-6&Zavala: This is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the -
Wooooaah!!!

Cayde-6: Hold on
Sorry, sorry, sorry
Tripped over the... speaker jack
(Cough, Cough)




 Devil May Cry, Never Say Die
End any enemy whenever they try
Body count rising every time
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

My character balances devil and dalliance
They should give me a medal for arrogance
Cause I believe that either Ivory or Ebony
Can annihilate at a higher rate
Than any enemy cannon
And I'm an adolescent Nephilim
Packing weapons and stepping in
I'm in my element
A bit of rebellion's good for development
I came as an angel, left as a devil
I'm raping the layers of hell, every level
Bellview Pier Resident, A nuclear weapon
Live on red alert, so never press
Do you hear, President?
I guess you learnt the hard way
Not to dance with Dante
Partake in a date with me
I'll leave you with a heartache, heart rate:
Irregular beating like a hard break, heartbreak
Your bars are archaic
I'd pray you never parley with me
For God's sake I can't take it
I live in the middle of Limbo City
Broken windows, it's so pretty
Life of grime, shit's so gritty
Got to kill time so I writ this ditty


I'm the Sword of the Order
That all of the forces are falling for
Psycho borderline
I'm sure that I was born with enormous balls
I got them from my father
Cause I'm a son of Sparda
My God, my tongue is sharper
Than katanas in the barber's
You're the bluntest in the genre
Should have done it harder
Now the best you're going to get
Is to become a martyr
Barbas is a lardass, couldn't spar fast
With a hardass, I'll smack his chops
Leave him looking like a car crash
Black and blue
I rap to bruise Raptor news
Blast your propaganda back to you
Get Kat to tag the facts across your camera view
Man, my music's maxed out
So what's a chap to do
Come back for the next track
You'll find out after Chapter II
Thanking you
Good afternoon
Good afternoon
Good afternoon

Devil May Cry, Never Say Die
End any enemy whenever they try
Body count rising every time
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9




 (Ah) My name's Deckard Cain, reincarnate
I'm the author of the lore for this dark place
I understand you're a guy on a mission
But if you could just give a min, stay a while and listen
Because again the land of Sanctuary's fucked
By the forces of darkness, Thank you very much
And I suppose I'm responsible for dealing with this
Demon epidemiological chronicle of a diabolical oracle, it’s horrible
When your chance of living is thinner than a hair follicle
Smaller than a molecule.. Hell is more than metaphorical
It's down under the town in the cracks, underground like my raps
Now let me tell you the facts
You'll need these to get yourself through the acts
So ensure your ears are clear and sound gets through the wax
I come in one of five flavours at once:
If you need speed then you'll favour the Monk
The Wizard is a mage, the Demon Hunter's ranged
The Barbarian is in a rage at the front
The Witch Doctor is the main name for shamanism
Today's the day you make the fate-changing decision
Make haste into the prison of the Dark Lords
Who start wars with us, they'll see we're hardcore
If you're struggling with Azmodan, just
Tap my number in and ask for Dan, cause
In that conundrum I am the man
To leave a demon heaving, gasping
Like it's asthma, damn, cuz
I got the master plan
I GOT THE MASTER PLAN
I take my scrap to be crafted by an Artisan
The improvement of loot is essential
With the exception of my weapon - the pencil
Tearing apart skeletal archers like parchment
Giving your heart a myocardial infarction
You'll beg my pardon if I look like an old gnome
But I've written whole tomes on the Soulstones
So lyrically I'm lethal, all I need is beats
And my speech to defeat the Prime Evil
We will succeed cause I'm a wizard
And I run this game like Blizzard (huh-ha)




 Left to fester in a prison cell
This is living hell
But I've never been a fellow to just sit and dwell
On how they set me up
Said I killed the empress
My will for vengance
Somewhat similar to my skills: it's endless
Distill the tension
Build momentum
'til the thrill's tremendous
I'm going to bring a world of pain to them
That's real relentless
They'll feel horrendous in their final living seconds
A cold breath on their shoulder as death beckons
And shows them in this most fleeting of moments
There's no grave
Their remains are feeding the rodents
Now those close to them
Are grieving and broken
I leave the bereaved
With my deepest condolence
That's one more completed atonement
Closer to the Lord Regent
My meanest opponent
He's a treasonous Caesarless Brutus
Jesus, he's the evilest elitist Judas
He is leaving us deseased
I don't believe it's Lupus
These streets are heaving with the Weepers
Who are really ruthless
The old boys' club in an all-boys school
They control all of Dunwall
The Tallboys rule
I'm after Lady Boyle
So pass the baby oil
You need your nappy changing, man
My rapping made you soil
Defacation
From a blend of dread and veneration
Of an assassinating rapper's devastation
A declaration
Destination: desolation
Defamation of your delegation
Desecration
Desparation
A dedication
To the deprivating
Deformating
Depredation of your nation
Detonation
My reputation precedes me
Like I was played in a demonstration at E3
You couldn't easily beat me
I rake in loads of bone charms
Believe me, I'm beastly
I'll break your bones in both arms

Tonight
I'm bringing Dunwall to life
As I walk on water
Through walls of light
You heard the king
As the urchins sing
Revenge solves everything
(4x)




 The Empire's got a new boss
Delilah Copperspoon, what a loon, not human, too posh
Her city's a machine and I'm a loose cog
I'm popping out the wall like a cuckoo clock
To move across rooftops in two hops
I'm mute, but if I need to I'll blow the roof off
And kudos to you lot, that do what you've got to do to follow through and shoot a true shot
When a bolt from the blue shocks you
I'm going to watch to determine who's true and who's not
The world's bursting with vermin and parasites
Who surface disturbing this permanent paradise
Cannibalising itself then metabolising the toxins
And we're shocked when it's paralysed
I know violence is glamorised so I have analysed and agonised on every dying man I've sliced!

TAKE BACK WHAT'S YOURS
Walk through floors, walls, and locked doors
TAKE BACK WHAT'S YOURS
'Til warm water pours from all your pores
TAKE BACK WHAT'S YOURS
All aboard, pull the oars 'til we storm all your shores
TAKE BACK WHAT'S YOURS
'Til your foes crawl gory floors on all fours

There's smoke and dust choking us
I hope it won't combust
It's coating the mechanism of oppression's spokes with rust
There's only so much that we'll let our load be pushed
To the overseers who oversee us I show disgust
How come they get the loaf while we beg below for crusts?
I don't trust them just as far as I could throw the fucks
And when stones are chucked, bones are bust, wounds are opened up
Resistance and revolt's a must
We're going for broke or bust
Fed up of hanging 'round shanty towns in hand-me-downs
I'm tracking down your family if you don't hand me the crown
Today's the day that I will finally find the fire inside
To come and claim what's rightfully mine
I'm tripping the kingdom and crying for children, men, and women to rise
Your tyranny's rivers are dry
My, this is a riveting sight
In the blink of an eye, you're going to die
So think of your imminent plight
Give it a try
I decline to give up the fight 'til the end of my life


I'm going in
I'm of the inclination to instigate an insubordination
This is an incantation; an invocation, invitation to an investigation
I'll infiltrate, interpret and inseminate insider information
Incite intimidation in interrogation to get an indication of the indignatious indoctrination inundated in her nation
Of integration, immigration, indiscrimination, interrelation, and inflammation in inhabitation under industrialization
Innocuous inoculation against an infestation
Insinuation? Incrimination
Implication? Incarceration
It's an illustration of the inculcated inconsideration incubated in us since her installation
The inauguration initiated intensification of inebriation imitating inspiration
Intoxication impersonates invigoration
Instrumental in inhibiting imagination
Innovation replaced with irritation
Infatuation with infuriation
Illumination with immolation
Incineration and inhalation of the vapour's incapacitation
I'm impudent indemnification's insolent incarnation
Your argument just is invalidation




 Ooh, I say

Deep down, down below the waves
Is a foreboding place
From which you won't escape
No, those who go there go to stay
Below the ocean spray
Who knows your fate
A little lassie in an overcoat
Stowed away
Six is at a precocious age
Or so they say
Don't they?
If she was any younger
Six would have succumbed to hunger by now
Is it any wonder?
I wonder
Why we're frightened of lightning and thunder
Sneaking around
Feet on the ground
Never even making a peep or a sound

Dive into the madness
Try swimming through miasmic blackness
Dive into the madness
Seasick from the spinning of the atlas
Ooh, I say
You gave me a fright there
I thought I was having a little nightmare
Ooh, I say
You gave me a fright there
So scared that I might get white hair

Strange shadows are disguised in the bright glare
Where did she hide?
She was right there
I swear
I glare with a wide eyed stare
At the site where I spied her
My girl
I hope you're strapped up tight in your high chair
I'm not adequately providing childcare
How well you might fare
If only I would fight fair
In my spare time I like to strike fear
Into the hearts of the horrid little children
Let's be honest, then
I'm probably going to kill them
Chop them
Chuck them
Lob them off a building
Do you really need the details filled in?
Entrails spilled and boiled into goop
Seasoned with herbs and then served as a soup
Feeding the mouths of the greediest guests
Look and see for yourself
It's easy queasy to digest

Ooh, I say
You gave me a fright there
What a sickening sight
That's quite rare
Ooh, I say
You gave me a fright there
I thought I was having a little nightmare
Dive into the madness
Vanishing the line dividing good and badness
You can only hide under your mattress
Til' you need to resupply your lighters and matches

You can be sure that in the jaws of the maw
You're going to come out looking like you've fought in the war
Mauled with the paw of the polar bear
Halt hold it there
All fall to the floor
You're insulting the law
And the ball's in my court
Don't run
There's little point bolting the door
When I'm holding a saw
And patrolling for gore
My depravity gland's all swollen and sore
You find that revolting I'm sure
I don't care
I'll shove you through a revolving door
I wrote the rules down here
And all I am concerned with
Is fear
Dive into the madness
Dive into the madness now
Dive into the madness
Dive into the madness now
Dive into the madness
Dive into the madness now
Dive into the madness




 My feet leave the diving board
In time to the awe of the audience
Now I'm aboard the flight
Arms rise from my sides
And combine to form a spire
And rise before the fall
But I don't fall
I glide toward the water
All the time my thoughts
Are all but paused
I slice the water like a fallen Titan
All Poseidon's glory shines in my form
For a fleeting moment I don't breathe
But I believe in so much
The pressure represses the
Pressures of everything ever
So that only the moment
That's present is precious
A pregnant pause
Rise to the surface
Emerge and
Then the roar
A perfect dive
10's the score
It's worth the rise
When you fall like this




 I can't believe I cut myself filming this
That's how my DLC makes me
I'm fucking bleeding because of DLC

(Badum, badum, badum, badum)
(Badum, badum, badum, badum)
Downloadable content's a load of nonsense
I won't give them one cent
It wouldn't be conscientious
Encouraging dodgy ventures
Like when you've been robbed
Do you get your property straight back from the fences?
I want to know what the defence is
Hence this musical census
Pay attention to community consensus
To prevent this backlash of hashtags
And truly contentious lambasts, eg:
I hope you're shoving your Prothean
Up your fallopian
No wonder the planet's becoming dystopian
Draconian Napoleons invoking pandemonium
And I might be blowing my own euphonium
By quoting this
But I know I'm not the only one that's pissed
My data's trapped inside the disc
Sat in lines of script
And I have to pay to take it out
What kind of shit is this?

It's the DLC PLC
Where we make money selling people things that were free
Welcome to the DLC PLC
Where we charge you for things you bought previously

No need to be dishonest
The incompleted product's a piece of bollocks
So please give me the pieces of it
And leave my wallet, I need the dollars
But don't be extremely bothered
I'll probably buy the sequel of it
Cause that's the key
The reason it keeps on happening, it's obvious
If you pay them quids they take the piss
And get away with it
Until they're pinching all your paper
Like a paperclip
And what would our forefathers
Have thought of horse armour?
It's all rather an awful palava
Perhaps I should make a call and talk to Obama
You're causing drama
And according to the laws of karma
Stir the water, sure enough
Of course you'll taunt the poor piranhas
So try to pull my jaws apart
I'm sure you can't
I'm sinking my teeth into the greed
Inherently buried in DLC things
Hidden fees and prices surprising me like bee stings
Is it any wonder we punters are seething

At the DLC PLC
Where we make money selling people things that were free
Welcome to DLC PLC
Where we charge you for things you bought previously

I'm sorry, but Verse 3 is only available in the Premium version of this song
If you would like to acquire the Premium version, then please bend over with your VISA, American Express or MasterCard lodged tightly between your buttocks
Thank you for your continued loyalty

Where we make money selling people things that were free

Downloadable content...what is it? What use does it have? What function does it serve? I mean, obviously I know the answer, but it's a sort of rhetorical quesiton I suppose. So maybe you think about it whether...whether it's good for the gaming community, whether it's good for the industry, what your thoughts about it are. I'm very keen to know!




 Only rapper to be called a thief without stealing
Download an MP3 for free, these people hit the ceiling
I'm just a citizen that's teaching you a lesson
For restricting my freedom of expression
How can ideas be possessions when they're freely replicable?
Hence unapplicable property laws are reprehensible
Didn't Jefferson express his opinion on the matter
When he said inventions shouldn't be given a patent
What happened to that thinking, we're stuck in a pattern
Where the people with everything are keeping everything from us who haven't
We want it back, look, fed up of adverts, left and right
Begging me to buy til there's nothing left of mine
To spend, never mind, who's next in line to testify
That we need laws like these to protect our rights?
Medicine has never been something I'd ever deprive
Especially when a life depends on it to survive
Yeah, it takes an incredible effort to develop them right
But putting wealth over health, I said it's never been right

I'm just a citizen that's teaching you a lesson
For restricting my freedom of expression, and I reckon
If old blues themes hadn't been used by Led Zeppelin
We wouldn't ever have any heavy metal then
The history of music would have never even happened
And amusingly there wouldn't even be a Metallica
To tell us that we should hang on the gallows of law
So we wouldn't even need to have a Gallo Report
Oh and by the way the fricking Gallo's support
Is made of signatures which have been apparently forged
This shit is sinister, and cannot be allowed to enforce
So tell your ministers and MEPs of how it's been brought about
Although you'll probably get a shallow retort
Because the lobbyists have got a grip around all their balls
If I was boss, I'd tell them get the Hell out the door
Because I've had enough of corrupt crooks ramming through laws

I'm just a citizen that's teaching you a lesson
For restricting my freedom of expression
Yes, and deep packet inspection? squeeze that up your rectum
If your postman did that to you you'd be having him sectioned
Arrested for meddling in your private affairs
But it's only online, right? so why should we care?
Because digital rights should be applicable right
Here in real life, and we're not criminals, right?
So this is just why we'll never give up the fight
To be considered innocent until we kick up and die
Giving internet providers responsibility
For the whims of their subscribers infringes privacy
Before the internet, media was a rarity
But how do you expect it to keep its value without scarcity
And that's what scares me, seeing their cons and schemes
To stop their creaking business model being obsolete
What a robbery they pull off so obviously
Don't give a fuck who it affects as long as it's not me
Well I'll keep making copies, see if they can stop me
They'll have to confiscate my PC and take it off me
See there's no problem with taking my property
For creating some lines of binary, blatant hypocrisy
Afraid to face the controversy relating to what we need
Making a profit off it or breaking monopolies




 I'm coming in now

This game's got a new twist
If you missed it
Let's do this
I'll introduce you to the dude gifted with huge mitts
It's Doomfist
When the tune shifts
And that boom hits
Then you get smacked
Through bricks flat
So cubist art critics are all asking you
"Ooh, who did that?"
Who mixes better metaphors that are fitting like a glove
If the shoe fits
Bruv, do you lift?
There's too many bloos in the queue
Shift
Move it or he'll use his Q shift
In two clicks your noob pick
Will be a view from the cliffs on Route 66
It's a true privilege
He picked you to hit

Every battle galvanizes the powerful
Weakness is a trait we won't tolerate or allow for
It's survival of the fittest, ruling with an iron fist
And pulverizing fools who try and resist
Every battle galvanizes those who merit it
Without the winning hand, you're doomed to go uncredited
It's survival of the worthy, gain control over the earth
Those who don't deserve a role are thrown into a world of hurt

Everybody trying to stop his nasty plans
For a piece of the pie
Will catch these hands in a meteor strike
Don't need guns, got these guns
Don't need reasons
Don't see a need to be tooled up
He's crushing any fool 'til they're all dust
That isn't an arm it's a school bus
Garnished with the pulled tusks of a walrus
Here's an announcement and a mouthful
He's sure more than a scoundrel
Employed at the Talon council
As a bouncer and a councilor
Man it's doubtful
You're not down for the count
Pound for pound
He's pounding you out
'Til you're shouting for someone to help
Don't look at me, call somebody else
Running your mouth
You're running a gauntlet
You'll get a suddenly sore lip
And a broken nose running like a faucet
So cork it or get launched into orbit
Awkward
When the straw poll's closed
And all's told
There's no poor soul
More swole
Punching a borehole in The North Pole
Split your wig fourfold
Warhol

Every battle galvanizes the powerful
Weakness is a trait we won't tolerate or allow for
It's survival of the fittest, ruling with an iron fist
And pulverizing fools who try and resist
Every battle galvanizes those who merit it
Without the winning hand, you're doomed to go uncredited
It's survival of the worthy, gain control over the earth
Those who don't deserve a role are thrown into a world of hurt

Straight outta Nigeria
Criteria:
Strike fear in the mind of inferiors
You might experience serious harm to your insides and interiors
Period
You might be curious
Why he really doesn't like gorrilas
And it's quite clearly
Because he was confined for years
In a tight area
By Winston
Now he's quite furious
Poor Winston
Winston's sad
And now poor Winston's mad
He's been stung bad
Coming in for the world's biggest fist bump
Sit on that
Big strong lad with a big strong jab
King Kong in combat
With the chimps
They never should have picked on Ak
Do you reckon that they're gonna live long
Nah
It's knuckle crunch time
One size fits all
He won't be sticking it where the sun shines
It's sore
I saw a rocket punch that put me off my lunch like
A bunch of fives in a row, that's a punchline
No other stomach in this planet
With a dozen pack
His guns are cannons
Hooks are savage
Like this custom track is, plus he's black
Not that it matters, I just thought I'd add it
'Cause it was a fact
Such a subtle language
Plus a massive knuckle sandwich
Double damage
Fingers like shovels
Slamming fists down like a shuttle landing
Smashing the toughest skull to fragments
Like they're dud ceramics
Running up and uppercutting past your buff mechanics
Slapping you so chuffing fast
It's looking like you've up and vanished

Every battle galvanizes the powerful
Weakness is a trait we won't tolerate or allow for
It's survival of the fittest, ruling with an iron fist
And pulverizing fools who try and resist
Every battle galvanizes those who merit it
Without the winning hand, you're doomed to go uncredited
It's survival of the worthy, gain control over the earth
Those who don't deserve a role are thrown into a world of hurt




 My first heartbeat; life starts sweet
I'm a part of her and she's a part of me
I can't believe these feelings I'm feeling
It hardly seems real - I'm dreaming
Me being a being, breathing
A beacon beamed in by the beat of birth
A seed, a sperm, I leave in search
I need to fertilise so I can be with the world
The bees and the birds, trees and the herbs
Even the Earth and the people, I need to immerse
The first physical feelings seep through my nerves
Pins and needles tingle deep and it hurts
But it's worth it as I creep to my birth
To be with the legions of unique creatures on Earth
I'll treasure each thing I learn
And teach it to others in turn
Now I'm a good person

I'm safe in this womb
A place in which wounds won't do no harm
I'm safe in this womb
A place in which wounds won't do no harm
I'm safe in this womb

An old man, with my whole family
Standing around me holding my hand
I'm cold and even beneath the folds of my blanket
The heat seeps from me; I'm freezing
I'm wheezing, my breathing's increasingly weak
And the people with me seem to be fleeting
But it's me that's leaving - I need to
I need to be at peace soon
I see through the veil
The innate truth that humans fail to value til it's too late
Choose fate, lose waking consciousness
And at once succumb to a new state of mind
Where space and time, they combine, entwine
And you face the universal I
Are you the first to die? No
But I know that it's finally my time to go

I'm safe in this room
A place in which wounds won't do no harm
I'm safe in this room
A place in which wounds won't do no harm
I'm safe in this room




 Who's rapping
Dovahkiin
Dragons?
I'm not over keen
I'll dice 'em like a knife slicing right through an aubergine
My dragon shout flow is sweeter than a soda stream
You won't believe your eyes I'm like an overload of dopamine
A broadsword in one hand
And a magic spell in the other
I'm the last of the Dragonborn
There's no other my brother
So run for cover
If you got scales
Then I'm on your tail
And I will not fail
Like a free-roaming
Sandbox game
I'm off the rails-
I'll walk the trails-
Thru awful gales-
And storms of hail-
'til all the nails-
Are knocked into your coffin
I'm not stopping
'till you're impaled
And I've prevailed-
In the name of the Nords-
I pray to the Lords-
You'll all get a taste of the blade of my sword-
I'm taking on hordes of enemies
I face them with hoards of wepon'ry
They're draining my force-
So chemistry comes into play with retorts and recipes
Alchemixing like a DJ
Restoration restore my energy
My legacy-
Odyssey-
Elegy-
Prophecy's-
Written in heavenly bodies-
And buried with e-ver-ry body-
That ever did bother to mess with me-
Deading them terribly-
Horribly-
I'm a celebrity-
Honestly
You're a wannabe
I'm a prodigy
The suggestion you're better than me at being a warrior?
Ha!
Comedy
It's a gift to me
I don't just spit flames lyrically
But lit'rally
And the Elder Scrolls are scripts in which I've written your obitur'ry
I am the Dragonborn
Wearing a hat with bad-ass horns
I'm Dovahkiin-
Known globally-
You're nobody at all




 I've suffered cold nights
Discovered old shrines
Dug in gold mines
Won untold fights
Knocked back whole pints of mulled wine
Endeavored to climb
And weather the heights
'Til every dragons soul's mine
Solved the civil war
That split the soil
Like a fault line
But I'm getting bored
Of being in the borders
Of Skyrim for the whole time
So hold tight
As we all ride into Solstheim
I'm the bold type
Like the lines inside the Black Books
Open it up
And it grabs and sucks you in
So take a last look
At whatever you stepped in
When treading ahead
In this general direction
Better get protection
Cause the whole town's
Gone down with a fungal infection
A fuming human
Thu'uming
At the top of my head, shouting
From Raven Rock
All the way to the top
Of the Red Mountain
I can rap with incredible force
Twice as fast as ever before
My legacy
Odyssey
Elegy
Prophecy
Leveled it up
To incredible rocket speed
So you better be paying a bit of attention
Cause every day I'm penning my name ahead of the game
Getting insanely better at saying
Bloody everything
A miracle of lyrical ascension
By the Nine
What an entrance
By the time
You've tried that rhyme
Man, I'll be lining for my pension
And Miraak
He's Dragonborn
But he lacks
These badass horns
And can he spit a record of a syllable a millisecond?
I really don't reckon he can at all




 I've suffered cold nights,
Discovered old shrines
Dug in gold mines,
Won untold fights,
Knocked back whole pints of mulled wine
Endeavored to climb and weather the heights
'Til every dragon soul's mine,
Solved the civil war that split the soil,
Like a fault line,
But I'm getting bored
Of being in the borders
Of Skyrim for the whole time,
So hold tight as we all ride into Solstheim,
I'm the bold type
Like the lines inside the black books
Open it up and it grabs and sucks you in
So take a last look at whatever you stepped in
When treading ahead in this general direction
Better get protection
Cause the whole town's
Gone down with a fungal infection,
A fuming human Thu'uming at the top of my head, Shouting
From Raven Rock all the way to the top of the Red Mountain
I can rap with incredible force twice as fast as ever before,
My legacy, oddysey, elegy, prophecy, levelled it up
To incredible rocket speed
So you better be paying a bit of attention
Cause every day I'm penning my name ahead of the game,
And getting insanely better at saying bloody everything,
A miracle of lyrical ascension
By the Nine what an entrance!
By the time you've tried that rhyme
Man, I'll be lining for my pension,
And Miraak, Hes Dragonborn but he lacks these badass horns
And can he spit a record of a syllable a millisecond
I really don't reckon he can at all!




 I assume you've met before
No we haven't actually
Hi, my name's Daniel
And who might you be?
She introduced herself
Then I/he offered her/me a drink
Now we're together
S/he's the one for me

She wants to be a vegan but still eats cheese sandwiches
Holidays in Sweden, speaks three languages
Mandarin Chinese, Norwegian and English
Good girl most of the time but dabbles in cannabis
Which has its advantages for imaginative fantasists
A bit of an anarchist political activist but isn't a twat with it
Has an ambition to make cinema, act in it
In fact, she's already written a manuscript
She's the whole package, gift wrapped in bandages
Ready to be unravelled now she's found the right man to kiss
Sometimes we're out and other lads try and chat her up
But she always has the perfect comeback to back her up
Before I saw her, I thought that I was lacking luck
But my next decision was ditching pessimism, pack it up
How could I hate a world that made this girl how she looks
So if you're asking me my fantasy, that's the stuff

Girl of my dreams
She's the one for me
Girl of my dreams
Certainly the one for me

She's got a soft spot for prog rock, often wears odd socks
Not because she's kooky, but just because she's got lots
Of other things on her mind like what time One Stop's
Open so we can make some late night Quorn hot dogs
Like me, see, she's got a wonky body clock
Sometimes it's tomorrow before she nods off
With her it's non-stop, she makes night brighter than the daytime
Utilises every second on the clock
We've got a lot in common - great minds
So we often say the same lines at the same time
She's the alto counterpoint to my bassline
I knew she had soul when I heard it through the grapevine
Marvin Gaye, Sly Stone, Curtis Mayfield
Bill Withers, Billie Holiday, Dusty Springfield
She'll spin vinyl, and I like the things she plays
I'm acquiring a taste for the the finer things of late
She'll listen to bebop from 1958
Coleman, Coltrane, Tyner, Mingus, Davis
I'd find them in her playlist, that's when I'd begin to say
This is too good to be true; it's like I've been to Vegas
The way that I've hit the jackpot, it's nice to think I've made it
Light of my life, when she's shining, it's amazing
My spine was tingling ages once my eyes had seen her face
Because her smile's an invitatition to a better place
Let us celebrate


With her monogamy is never monotony
She's got lots of opinions which she expresses honestly
She dresses modestly, but knows she's sexy (obviously)
Talks filthy but still says every letter properly
She's got a Monopoly on me, hot property
But she knows well that a posh hotel is not for me
She'll pop an e but never have a pop at me
For being drug free because she's seen me when I'm ugly
Acting abominably and she still loves me phenomenally
When I go wrong, I just follow her lead
Come along with me, she says, because I wanna sleep together
So we throw our overcoats on and leave for heaven


She's into literature, in particular, De Bernières
Firmly aware that living's all about the journey there
She isn't into girly affairs like perming her hair
But it's sweet, she still sleeps with her first teddy bear
And when it's early, she wears no make up, and has puffy eyes
But I find it a great look because she's mine
She looks fine with her hair tied up or even better down
I swear that no-one looks better in a dressing gown
She's so giggly that her nose goes wrinkly
Simply because I've been up to bring her a drink, you see
I'm into coffee, she likes a hot cup of tea
That's one of the few topics on which we do not agree
She watches old films, ticks ones off she hasn't seen
Her guilty pleasure's reading gossip magazines
Now I often have a real problem with what I can believe
But seeing her, there's not a chance I'm dreaming


She's certainly the one for me
Man I really adore her
So I'm perching on my knee
And I'm kneeling before her
Six months' salary
On the ring that I've bought her
I ask her "Will you marry me?"
And she says "Dan, of...."

*Alarm clock going off*
Errr no, for Pete's sake
I had the girl of my dreams and wasn't even awake




 It is a time without any hope
Of murder and intrigue, dagger and cloak
Savages roam through magic and smoke
And various other high fantasy tropes
There's a hero's job to be filled
Send your CV along to the guild
Perks include tons worth of loot
But the drawbacks are you'll probably be killed
No respite
From the death knight
He won't stop, even at red lights
When it's way past his bedtime
He'll keep at it til he meets that deadline
The one where your death is a headline
He's a wrecker of men's minds
Dissolve their soul like an enzyme
Please
Prevent him from bringing the end times

Jump in (jump in)
To the dungeon (the dungeon)
Hunting (hunting)
For something (something) undead (undead)
Fighting (fighting)
Surviving (surviving)
Striking terror in the hearts of my foes
Til they die then I take what I find to my liking

I'm an isometric adventurer
Raising your telephone's processor temperature
Trekking the breadth and the length of Valenthia
I'm not hiking for fun, I was sent here
Raving, waving death incarnate
Draped and garbed in a justicar arcplate
Partake in the chase for pay
Til I make more change than a busty barmaid
Look at my loot and all my skills
You're not allowed to join my guild
Me and my pals were all quite thrilled
When we saw you were just another fool I'd killed
Hacking and slashing, you couldn't kill faster
That's why it's me and not you that's guildmaster
You're as easy to hack as the password "password"
You daft bastard

Jump in (jump in)
To the dungeon (the dungeon)
Hunting (hunting)
For something (something) undead (undead)
Fighting (fighting)
Surviving (surviving)
Striking terror in the hearts of my foes
Til they die then I take what I find to my liking

You plebs are living in fear
I'm living for legendary gear
Can't wait for the set to appear
I'm a trifle obsessed, is it weird?
I'm a little bit OCD
No PC games, no TV
No distractions, no interruptions
Nobody better be phoning me
I'm in the zone, elite
And knowing me
I supposedly stole your seat
So go and tell your homies please
That I rode this beat
Like a noble steed
Throwing blows at your nose til your noses bleed
I've got rows of runestones for teeth
Saving the place from a plague
And then making sure I'm going home for tea

Jump in (jump in)
To the dungeon (the dungeon)
Hunting (hunting)
For something (something) undead (undead)
Fighting (fighting)
Surviving (surviving)
Striking terror in the hearts of my foes
Til they die then I take what I find to my liking
(x2)




 Me? I'm horny, short for the Horned Reaper
I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper
Unbelievers better take a step back
Because I set traps till they leave your necks snapped
Forget a pimp slap switch up the syntax
Take away the P, see I deliver Imp Slaps
There's a slim chance that you've ever seen an enemy
With melanin as red as this; the menacingest skin rash
Better bring your shin pads
Cause when I swing axes
There's an equal need for medicine and bin bags
(Chorus)
I'm horny, short for the Horned Reaper
I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper (x2)
(Verse 2)
You ought to have taken a tad more care
With your fortification cause that wall there's
Gonna fall and then cave in, I'll nab your lair
You'll be sore as the day when I stabbed your bare bottom
And in case you've forgotten
I hail from a place that is fatally rotten
So debased I can make even Satan pee off
And I must say that is painfully often
Your safe, I'm unlockin', knicking your millions
Sticking your minions straight in a coffin
I plunge in to your dungeon, lungin' through your little buggers
Like I'm cuttin' through an onion
Under ye' foot, plunder ye' loot
Funneling your funds to me, can you compute?
The heart of your dungeons the dungeon heart
I'm taking pleasure, breaking it and pulling it apart
Then take your treasure, claiming it, as bullion in carts
Now you see red, I'm the bully in the dark
(Chorus)
I'm horny, short for the Horned Reaper
I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper (x2)
(Outro)
The hand of evil strikes again!




 It's dark, and Hell is hot
Dan Bull...
Iniquity...
Let's go...
(Yea, yea, yea!)

I'm Kyle Crane, taking down anybody with a vile brain
Best stay still or they just may feel
An iddy biddy little bit of mild pain
Sunrise, it's burgling time, I don't wanna die so I work in the light
To swerve all the psychotic murderers lurking at night
Far cry from a Turkish Delight
Cos when the night falls, you require giant balls
Just to survive, I hope you like to climb walls
Be mindful and just know that you might fall any moment
There's no slowing their roll when they're going with no control
And you know it, I swear by the penis on me
I wouldn't wanna be the zombie
There's a meanness, I feel it strongly
I can be as mean as the Viet Cong be
I treat these eejits wrongly
Their bodies are an ambling canvas
For an artist of the art of survival
And the university of life's my campus
Go ham on the thankless bandits, madness!
In your pants there's a dampness
I'll grab an axe and I'll have you handless
Or maybe take a hammer to your hippocampus
Pro scavenger son, you're an amateur one
When I handle a gun, the damage is done
And although this is serious business
I admit that I'm having some fun

The Light's dying and dim, the night's trying to get in
Am I hiding, lying crying quiet, whining with the whitest skin?
NO! the Light's dying and dim, the night's trying to get in
I'm climbing, fighting, grinding, swiping, slicing, striving to win!

Whose light is dead? Shit, it's not mine
I been shinin' through the Slums now and I'm quite fed
Still hungry for more so the Zombies see gore
The king warlord, your corpse'll recite death
Pipes, pistols, propane tanks, the pain is pure
Man, I'm going postal
Bites? Bitch you won't gain haste
I'm the bane of your existence, boastful
I'm feared by infected, so hereby respected
By nearby survivors with hope
I'm more fierce by the second, adhere to my weapon
No mere title reckons my wrath, I'm the G.O.A.T
I'll sleep when I'm done, til then believe the world's my arsenal
While I'm out here slaying volatiles, they bleed
Tell me will ya balls see growth?
No bolter escapes my range, the massacre is bound to happen
Homie, this soldier awakes with rage
These bastards are astounded, fasten
Ya seatbelt - they're like, "He's hell,"
"Better stay back or our blueprints will rot"
Whether the crowbar or cricket bat, given that I'm a beast
I send biters to their box
Here goes - I'm here to prove myself
Dan Bull and Iniquity Rhymes
These bars'll give you that 8 mile syndrome
It hits home, Lose Yourself in fractions of time
Fight for your life, is it rude if I mention
I frighteningly like all the feuds with Rais' Henchmen
I might even bite, you will lose and die drenched in
The blood of my foes, ensue all of my vengeance
Dying Light

The Light's dying and dim, the night's trying to get in
Am I hiding, lying crying quiet, whining with the whitest skin?
NO! the Light's dying and dim, the night's trying to get in
I'm climbing, fighting, grinding, swiping, slicing, striving to win!

This is some shit to see
Dan Bull and Iniquity
This is some shit to see
Dan Bull and Iniquity
This is some shit to see
Dan Bull and Iniquity
Goodnight, and goodluck!




 Look
Pay attention
It's the Dyton Brothers
When they rarely follow the rule
"Be nice to others" (hah)
They leave behind a big pile of frightened buggers
Who are hiding under the bed, they're behind the covers
At the back of the sofa
Or inside the cupboards
And just tremble at the mention of the Dyton Brothers
(Boom)
Aaah
Run for cover (ha-hah)
You're looking for a fight
It's the Dyton Brothers (aaah)
Oooh
Run for cover
If you really need a poo
It's the Dyton Brothers (ha-hah)

Goodbye, 
Mwahaha
Woo-hoh




 Hm....so
Another E3
Another hard year
Less about games
This time about hardware
Sony announces Playstation Move
Which is apparently some kind of luminous spoo
And it wasn't inspired
Or had anything to do
With the Wiimote
Remotely, I promise you
Then Kinect got shown off on the Xbox
Yet another extra add-on at an extra cost
Nintendo announced 3DS
That lets you see 3D without 3D specs
Who wants the reason for all this E3 tech
When there hasn't even been a decent game released yet?
Remember when gaming was about, well, gaming?
Not jumping up and down in your lounge and waving
It's like every year we see the same things
"Aliens seize earth and face off against space marines!"
Well, the whole game scene yawns and waits to see
Whether any of the developers have any innovation up their sleeves
But it seems not
And that's a shame to me
Maybe I should just shut up
And wave at my TV

Please
Let's see something better at next year's E3




 We're on a plane to L.A
And we're never gonna stop
Beatboxing with my ear
When the drum goes pop
Horrible zombies
And hurtful plants
So we're gonna need a World of Tanks
As you can see
I'm not quite as tall
As this robot from Titanfall
If you don't like The Witcher
You can probably dismiss this
But I just got a lolly from witches
We're about to get onto the escalator
You haven't got a pass
So I'll check you later
People in queues?
Flipping sod those
Get out of my way
Like fish in CoD: Ghosts
They've been queueing for t-shirts
Since yesterday
Looks like it's gonna be their Destiny
What's in the next M.G.S.?
Only Snake'll know
Castlevania looks like
A Game of Thrones
Elder Scrolls is amazing
No lag at all
I'm holding the mace of Molag Bal
Bethesda is repping Elder Scrolls Online
But don't forget about Wolfenstein
Activision are back to back with Blizzard
Dat Division

I'm freestyling
My style is free
Actually, I...
Paid a fee
For the clothes that you see
I'm here at E3 2013
You know what I mean
'Cause I said it in English
Mm-hmmm
Sometimes I sing-lish
Woo hoo hoo hoo ho
For no reason
Singing singing for no reason, it's the season
For the re... a... r... r... ra...
...Treason
That rhymes, mother...

Man, my rhymes are tighter than Busta's
Standing side to side with Tobuscus
Sonic at the top
Like a boss hog
Everybody's getting watched
Like in Watch Dogs
Xbox privacy?
That is a delusion
Fake, Mickey Mouse
Castle of Illusion
I burnt my forehead
It's pink as hell
I should have kept under cover
Splinter Cell
Diablo three'll make me crazy and scared
Like I've just seen an alien
Where?
I've been bitten by a zombie
That'll feel raw
So what am I still on the Battlefield for?
Soon it's gonna be a dark night
Batman
Let's go, I'm hungry
Pac-Man




 In a bid to appeal to the younger electorates
The leaders of the three main parties have agreed to a fourth televised debate
In the form of a rap battle
Gentlemen, introduce yourselves

Brown: Gordon Brown, Labour Prime Minister
My style's like my temper, quite sinister
Cameron: I represent the Tories, my name's David Cameron
The chap with more flash than a cameraman
Clegg: I'm Nick Clegg, the head of the Lib Dems
My timing on the mic is precise as Big Ben
Brown: Labour's done amazing things over the past ten years
Cameron: Two wars, a recession, and cash for peers
Like I said, too many twits make a twat
And too many years in power make that
Brown: Vote for Labour
Cameron: No, vote Tory
Brown: Labour
Cameron: Tory
Clegg: Hello! Don't ignore me!
While these two are stuck in an argument
I'm the one with real power in a hung Parliament
To vote Lib Dems is to vote for change
Cameron: Uh, no, it's to throw your vote away
Clegg: We're not like the other two, we don't pretend to be
Brown: We know, you haven't even governed for a century
Clegg: There's no confidence in the encumbrance and Cameron's incompetent
Cameron: Well, you're a (bleep), Nick
The Tory party's all about family
That's why I like to drag mine out to stand with me
Brown: Well, I'll never use my kids as props
That is until my approval rating drops
Clegg: Talking about my private life's forbidden
Although I have slept with thirty women
Brown: Personally, I don't like women, they're bigoted
Clegg: Uh, Gordon, your mic's still transmitting
Brown: Flipping heck, I offer my sincerest apologies
Cameron: That gaff was a bigger cock-up than your policies
Brown: How can you talk about democracy
With that spoon stuck in your mouth by the aristocracy?
Cameron: I don't approve of this
Brown: Then get on your bike
Clegg: Can I sit in the car following behind?
Brown: No, you're a third wheel
Cameron: Unstabilised
Clegg: Whoever wins, I'm being taken for a ride
Brown: Right, there's only one fair way we can decide
Come on, posh boy, step outside




 I like cups of tea, cutting beats, matching sets of cutlery
Depending on the fan, I like it when a fan comes up to me
But some of you are just too bloody much for me
You know me, but mutually, I've not that luxury
So it's worthwhile to say something introductory
Fame is a brave new world, and I'm no Huxley
I went to Germany, so tons of people rushing Cookiebreed
I think, if it wasn't him, it definitely was somebody
And that's the point I'm trying to make, we're all just individuals
We all get itchy balls or sweaty bits under your tits
It's all normal, I'm just another organism
Who happens to have specialize in penning lines and talking rhythm

It's like The Prisoner, I'm Patrick McGoohan
Now everybody knows what this fat prick is doing
My YouTube channel's like a kinda creepy zoo
I spy with my eye the fact that I'll be seeing you
But I did it all with DIY, call it B&Q
My P&O Cruises launch so I see it through
It's difficult to be a weird dude publicly
Cause some of you are just too bloody much for me
But I keep doing my thing on the web
Oh, remind me I must enter king of the Web
Cause my to-do list is useless unless I really do this
And every other stupid wish I'm gonna make 'em true, bitch

At the end of my last verse, I said bitch
Why did I do that? It really makes my head itch
I'd like to think I'm not misogynistic
But sod you if you think I'm gonna keep my lips zipped
Can't keep my mouth shut, I'm a mouth slut
And you'll never shame me out of it, bitch, now what?
My main reason to breathe is freedom of speech
Provide me with a beat and I'll complete a transcript to my thought process and never press delete
Today is just another day I get to bless the beat
To all my critics who are less than impressed with me
This is for your arguments, rest in peace




 Sit up and listen, I riff on the rhythm
The sickest musician, the slickest magician
Who'll slip and then zip into different positions
While lifting a brick with no slip of permission
I'm not the most vicious of villain
I'm nicking it just to make vanilla thrilling
I'm not into killing but if you were
Given the gift of intuition
Then keep me within your peripheral vision
'Cause I'm of a jittery disposition
I'm a nervous guy that prefers to hide
I'm terrible shy and I don't know why
So please do me the following courtesy
And never look me in the purple eyes
I'm averse to being observed at night
So if you see me you deserve to die

You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no... no!

I see you peeking at me through the glass in the door
What, chap, are you asking for more?
Boy, you're jibbering jabbering like an old
Man reminiscing of back in the war
I'm naturally, massively tall
I should be practising basket-ty ball
But I can't find a ball without corners at all
So I'm passing the time by unstacking your wall
If we pass in the hall, you're gon'afto ignore me
Perhaps you should look at the grass on the floor
Grab a map and explore the various biomes
But be aware this is my home
I roam through the night alone
Hoping to find someone I can bone
But I'm out of sight and mind and time
Like a rotary dial phone
I don't want to die alone
My type of solo's a xylophone

You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no... Rockit!

You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no...

Don't look me in the eye, you better run and hide
I'm chasing after you until you die
Deadly as a knife, beautifully designed
I'm hunting you tonight until you die
It's time to tell the truth, a bomb you can't defuse
So easily amused to watch you die
Don't you try to fight, you're lucky you're alive
I have you in my sights... no, no, no, no

Now you see me, now you don't
Shoving a dirt block down your throat
You better not be getting out your boat
I suggest that you don't leave the house alone
Oh, no, I'm on a mission
To win this staring competition
I'll let you live on just one condition
If you put a pumpkin upon, you're forgiven
No, no, no, no




 We're here (Where?) Shear
Sh-sh-sh-sh, they're near
Listen, they can detect fear
Like sizzling bacons and eggs
We're next on the breakfast menu, I thus
Am sensing some ennui, 'cause
There's a funny running through my tummy
And I really don't reckon it's appendicitis
Ready to get in a fight, thrust
And break something off like a fresh baked pie crust
Tireless when I bust spineless dinos up
With mindless violence
Look, I've got the minds touch
Each type of life that I touch is a pile of dust
You might rise up like Lazarus
But you can't Hyde, I'll find you, trust
I'm biased against a Goliath
Wiping him out like a pest or a virus
You'll never survive unless you're as clever as Caira
And you ain't, I bet you a fiver
My Trapper will track you to base
Even if it's deep as a trap track packed full of bass
I'm cracking ahead
Cracking a Kraken in the head, he's lacking the cred
Man, I'm back in your ends and attacking your nest, so you'll have to defend it
My manner and method of wrecking your plans like a Gent is actually splendid
That Chap's too cray, tell 2K
Pulling your cranium off like a toupée
Keeping up appearances
And insist on pronouncing bucket as bouquet
True say
Don't get involved in Evolve
If your soul isn't wholly controlled
To revolve round the goal
Ripping holes into all you behold
Keep it cold, you've been told
Said, don't get involved in Evolve
If your soul isn't wholly controlled
To revolve round the goal
Ripping holes into all you behold
Keep it cold, you've been told

Don't say you haven't been
Because you obviously have




 Never mind a Rolex
I got my Pip-Boy
And I'm ready to make some capital
In the capital

Look, ever since they dropped
The atomic bomb
You've been hold up in Vault 101
And since your momma's gone
You focused on abilities
Perception, endurance, intelligence, agility
Your skill in these categories is clear
And apparently you'll be needed
And since your daddy's disappeared
Now you're a big boy
Got your own Pip-Boy
What you need to succeed
Is a pistol to destroy
Anyone who's dumb enough
To look for trouble over here
I've had it up to here
With the fuckin' overseer
Kill him or go with stealth
Don't let nobody see it
Now you're overground and out
And the coast is clear
Here, a wild frontier
Is what we see
A post-apocalyptic Washington D.C
You should be headin' on whatever the direction
If you're a clever one you'll be visitin' Megaton
You'll meet the residents
And the Sheriff Lucas Simms
Now you can help him out or end up shootin' him
This sort of drama can cause your karma to diminish
But you do what you need to
When you choose to win
It's law of the Wasteland
So all of you wastemans oughtta stay back
And get a tool in your face
And when I pull out my strap
And activate the V.A.T.S
There's no way that
I'll let these twats escape the blast
I'll blaze away, but the way my rants are raising fast
A super mutant high on Psycho couldn't tame my ass!
I've never seen a blade of grass, this place is shit
So I need to locate the Garden of Eden Creation Kit
But before I do that, man, it's time for action
I have got to find the balance in between the rival factions
The battle's gettin' hyperactive, radioactive
Reilly's Rangers, Talons and the savage Raiders
Packed in conflict with the Enclave
Crushin' us under the heel
But I keep it bloody real
With the Brotherhood of Steel
We're heading for the war to end all wars
Not to mention all the sentry bots
Centaurs and deathclaws
You best pack a deadly force
Or you'll end up gettin' mauled
If you think that just a stimpak is plenty for
Level up, get better heavy weapons and perks
'Cause no matter hard you are, there's an enemy worse
Ladadadada
It's the motherfuckin' D.A.W.G
Three Dog!
Ladadadada
I'm on the radio in Fallout 3
You better make your way to Rivet City
And speak to Doctor Li
About Project Purity
When you installed John Henry Eden's FEV
Or will you connect the GECK and set the people free?




 Brother
While you were here playing beer pong
I was dealing with the viet cong
Me and my familia, we are strong
A real bond
So string along, I'm gonna sing a song
Now bring it on
Who are you? Hey, hey, who are you?
Clay I'm just a boy from the Bayou
There's a battle raging, man and nature
But if you can navigate the salivating alligators
Hell awaits you
See you at Sammy's place an hour later
And do a man a favour 'cause I'm outta paper
Grab the tab and pay the round
And get yourself a drink to drown your sorrows and a chaser
Down it straight and then head out onto the town for capers
My knuckles got a couple scars from scuffles in bars
Over shuffled cards, I hustle hard
There's a shovel in the trunk of my muscle car for when the trouble starts
Some dogs are only loyal 'till you pull the muzzle off
Visibly twitchy, there's a reason you're fidgety
Must be the midges, heat and humidity, breeding stupidity
Bitch
We've no need for your sympathy
Concealing your bigotry beneath a sheet of duplicity
And revealing your inner beast
Down in the deep south we do it differently
I mean if you're feeling me
Dead in the middle of river row, little did we know, that we riddled two middlemen who didn't do diddily
Oh
This is New Bordeaux (Bordeaux)
So what's a few more schmoes?
Asking for their ass kicked?
That's their last trick
How'd you like the bottom of a swamp for a casket?

Until you've had it all taken away, you'll never know
The meaning of family
Once you've had it all taken away, then all you'll want's
To be in a family

The new black mob, courtesy of Bourbon Street
Might not know me but you heard of me, certainly
The Marcanos tried to murder me, but when I pull the heat
My people started rising like mercury
The Italian Mafia, killed without mercy
So now it's time to turn this town topsy-turvy
If you in the family, then you getting amnesty
We plan to bleed these heathens from the city like a damn disease
New Bordeaux, my residency
And I can't control what the residents see
So me and my conglomerates, shall remain anonymous
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Put you in a coma not induced medically
Feed you to the creates not leaving a shred of evidence
Evidently I need to break it down, so lemme see
If you keep messing with me, you'll be a swamp delicacy
The only cocktail you drink is molotov
There'll be a few scorched men in New Orleans when we catch 'em nodding off
Bullets will be tossed across ya noggin
Keep on talking and we'll pop you like a bottle top
And transport you out of state
We dump bodies before they can draw the chalk lines
You can vanish without a trace
Safe to say, my serrated blade'll ruin y'all
Stabbed so many times, I got you looking like a voodoo doll
War is what it's time for, go and grab a knife or a shotty
Turn a sight for sore eyes into an eye sore
Got your body floating downstream towards the 9th ward
Family isn't who you're born with it's who you die for

Until you've had it all taken away, you'll never know
The meaning of family
Once you've had it all taken away, then all you'll want's
To be in a family




 Famous, I wanna be famous, famous
Famous, I wanna be famous, famous

Famous, I wanna be, wanna be
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be

Famous, I wanna be famous, famous

 Father, stretch my hands
Stretch them until they're all long and wibbly wobbly
So that I can't pick things up anymore
So that I can't wag my finger in disapproval at my haters
Oh, father, stretch my hands
Until I cry

Oh, baby
Why don't you come on over to my place?
We could, uh, sit on the couch, watch some movies
Watch some, some, some, some, some Netflix and chill
Or we could, we could, we we could, we could, we could play a game of backgammon
We could, we could, we could, we could
We could, we could
Wickity, wick wick wick wick wick wick (laughs)
We could, we could, we could, we could, um, uh
We could, we uh, we could fuck




 Smith, Stiffy, Skitch, McTwist into
A Kickflip, Liptrick, quick switcheroo
You kids get pissed if we missed a few
But we got a fricking big list of tricks to do
I'm like giving a nuke to Mr. Magoo
Hit the big red button, head butting
If you dispute
The only way i'll open my eyes to different views
Is when I'm owning the skies, 360 Degrees
Skatopia bred
Straight over your head
I can't skate, so I play it from my sofa instead
While you're wearing your Ray-Bans and getting a spray tan
The British are ripping up the American Wasteland
Dave and Dan are bringing the skill, singing at will
I'd give my kingdom for a H.O.R.S.E., call me King of the Hill
Rap's Richard the Third
Gap tricking with words
Ha!
Bringing a Flamingo that isn't a bird
Smack
Hitting the curb like my back wheel
But this isn't the certain Thug Life 2Pac feels
You won't be having your cap peeled
But I might crack a Melon, acapella
And prepare your last meal
A bit of Stalefish, you're not getting bailed prick
So get on your bike lest you get your little Tail Whipped
You failed to nail the trick
You've been derailed and made to pale into insignificance
You silly little-

I'm a Tony Hawk addict and I
Jump on my board grab it and fly
Fly (4x)
(2x)

First of all, I'd like to assure I'm all above board
But as gravity attests, I tend to break laws
That's legality suppressed when I Spacewalk
So I'm always entertained, I'll never skate bored
Half work, half play
That 50/50 grind
But there's two games at stake
And that's the rap and the skate kind
When I hear a hater say that it's only a game
"Revert to Manually skating"
What am I, a Caveman?
No way, fam!
So don't give me that Lip, Trick
When I flip out, jump up and grab you you'll zip quick
I'll hit with a Triple Kick, Flip you over, so
There's a high chance of a Spine Transfer while I bang this sick mix
I got them RSI rhymes
And if you disagree I'll be like "No, Comply"
While grinding pipes for sure brought nostalgia
If one more man misunderstands when I say Tony Hawk's Underground, I'll
Smack that Hipster and break his Indy Nosebone
Hit him so hard, I'll press his X chromosome
Then get air so high I'll bring back a boatload of ozone
And tell him what I told Newton: "just give up and go home!"

I'm a Tony Hawk addict and I
Jump on my board grab it and fly
Fly (4x)
(2x)

FML, FML, FML, FML-L-L

(choking sounds)




 Do you know how heavy heavy metal is?
And are you aware of the relief that death'll give?
Do you comprehend that you'll prepare for several years
Consecutively just for several seconds where you'll get to live?
The devil revels in revels in peril bearing witness
To feral zealots spilling vessels while you beg forgiveness
All's fair in love and war
Scorched air, the oven door's ajar
You took a snort and smelt the charred corpse
Blood and gore
A sudden pause
Slow the flow like a southern drawl
I'll cut you down until there's nothing standing
Bugger all
No trees in your countryside
It's something like an urban sprawl
I've got the wherewithal
To usurp your rule for ever more

Why did I do it, your honor?
For honor, your honor
When you're on a roll
You're going to do the things you sodding want to
And by the tear sliding down the cheek of the madonna
You can steal my dignity
But still it lives in me for honor

I've got a path to find
And an axe to grind
Close combat mastermind
So pass the wine, love
That's the fine stuff
I don't want to be the last to find love
That's the kind of fast life I lived
In a past life
Capsize the brig
Now the tides are in
Baptised in it
And tied to the mast of a pirate ship
Find me the man that can fight like this
And I'll chastise him with a childlike flick
Of the wrist with a fistful of iron, I guess
There's a finite risk
In that I might miss
But who cares on a night like this?
Swap a twilight tiff
For a night night kiss
It's my life and the highlight is
When I'm sharpening my knife like my wits

Why did I do it, your honor?
Why did I do it, your honor?
Why did I do it, your honor?
Why did I do it, your honor?
For honor, your honor
When you're on a roll
You're going to do the things you sodding want to
And by the tear sliding down the cheek of the madonna
You can steal my dignity
But still it lives in me for honor
For honor
For honor
Why did I do it, your honor?
For honor, your honor
When you're on a roll
You're  going to do the things you sodding want to
And by the tear sliding down the cheek of the madonna
You can steal my dignity
But still it lives in me for honor
Why did I do it your honor?
For honor your honor
When you're on a roll
You're going to do the things you sodding want to
And by the tear sliding down the cheek of the madonna
You can steal my dignity
But still it lives in me for honor




 Come on, Ali...
Oh oh oh oh oh

Ayy
I'm on a two week holiday (okay, nice), do you wanna play?
(No! I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding)
'Cause everybody else has gone away suddenly (what?)
It's rather strange, but I've got to say I kind of like the change (whoo)
My entire neighborhood's a violent firing range (nice)
Crashing your mainframe, I hope you made a backup
Can't even keep a straight face, you make me crack up
Mate, get out my personal space and back up (okay)
Unless you wanna see my body count rack up
I can keep it up all night, so baby back up (uh)
I'm the kind of guy with whom the ladies like to shack up (yeah)
And every time they tear it down, I build it back up (bam, it's up)
So why are you even trying? I advise you pack up
Like a white guy in Harlem trying to black up (whoo)
Who acts surprised when he's the one they want to smack up (what did I do?)
Night time's coming, better grab your gang and stack up (okay)
Load your weapons, set the trap up, and turn the track up

(Whoo)
Put on the coffee machine (yeah)
I've got a feeling that we're gonna be up all night (nice)
We're taking one for the team (yeah)
It's not a week's holiday at all, no, it's a Fortnite (whoo)
Hidden in the dark lurk horrible beings
So keep your blinds and your pleated curtains drawn tight (nice)
And we won't even know what was seen
Until the dusk's dust settles in the dawn light

At the end of the day, everybody back to my place
But I'm sorry, no reclining by the fireplace
(This is a little bit upsetting)
'Cause every life is only priced at what the buyer pays
We are responsible for our survival, our entire race
A dust storm's coming and it's thunderous
Ten hundred Husks rush from the dusk
Poor personal hygiene, a pungent musk
Phwoar! But I'm surrounded by the chums I trust (yeah)
We're ready to ruck with anyone that comes at us
Though for just a tick I wonder if my gun's enough (okay)
Until rrrap, shots fired from my blunderbuss
Are bloody numberless, you better run, you puss
Over hot coals or rather bumpy pot holes (yeah)
To toilet cubicles that don't have any bog rolls (okay)
My team will follow me to anywhere the fog rolls
Fortify the stronghold, #Squadgoals

(Whoo)
Put on the coffee machine (oh, what)
I've got a feeling that we're gonna be up all night (I could just go to bed right now)
We're taking one for the team
It's not a week's holiday at all, no, it's a Fortnite (whoo)
Hidden in the dark lurk horrible beings
So keep your blinds and your pleated curtains drawn tight (nice)
And we won't even know what was seen
Until the dusk's dust settles in the dawn light
(Let's build it sweet, let's build it fast)

I'm building a building that you'll be thrilled to be killed in (whoo)
Feelin' the thrill of the chase while you just chill with the children (okay)
'Til I dwell in a fortress, thick as the shell of a tortoise
Repelling the horde just with everyday tools plus (yeah)
Impaling these fool Husks, together with sword thrusts
Like elephant's dual tusks, my brethren are dauntless (okay)
Ooh, hello there gorgeous, you look hella exhausted
So step in my porch and let me tell you your fortune (okay)
You're 'bout to hear the best shit ever recorded
Whatever the result is, I shed a small tear
And burn my enemies to a crisp, they're ready salted
Oh, can you believe how easily they get insulted? (You're pissing me off)
Inflicting harm when it's dark, so get your armoured pyjamas
Hit your llama piñata and collect the treasure (ooh, more bandages)
Get set for hours of violence, it's a gala of carnage
And tomorrow's so far that it's effectively never

(Whoo)
Put on the coffee machine (yeah)
I've got a feeling that we're gonna be up all night (nice)
We're taking one for the team
It's not a week's holiday at all, no, it's a Fortnite (whoo)
Hidden in the dark lurk horrible beings
So keep your blinds and your pleated curtains drawn tight (nice)
And we won't even know what was seen
Until the dusk's dust settles in the dawn light

This is a little bit upsetting as someone who's put a lot of time into this game




 Welcome to the next generation

Man, I feel like a superstar
In a high powered supercar
Shoot for the stars, no stopping me
I’m revving up a cacophony
Doesn’t matter whatever you offer me
Won’t swap it for anything, honestly
The road ahead of me’s calling
And pole position is where I’ve just got to be
I’m an ace in a race, set a pace
That’ll take you to a range of places
Make you say “Ooh, great, amazing”
A trail in my wake as I blaze away
‘cause it’s the way that I make my paper
Do me a favour: Get out of my way, bruh
Boy racer with places to be
So it’s safe to say I’ll see you later

Forza Motorsport
Will open doors to a sort of ocean port
That’ll flow a course from coast to shores
The poetry of motion’s yours
Saddle up, we’re going on tour
You’ll ride astride your chosen horse
Through a load of applause
Such force
You were only supposed to blow the doors
Horsepower, galloping gallantly
Shoot for the stars, Galileo Galilei
Hey! Don’t prang my McClaren, geez
The tab to patch up the damage
Is grand as your annual salary
And apparently you just cannot handle me
So hand me the keys as I shoot for the stars
Blasting these supercars
To a brand new galaxy




 It's Terry Bull
Necking bevies 'til my belly's very full
I let it all hang out
Innit incredible?
This ain't a sports tournament
It's a festival
To see how many people we can turn into vegetables
It's not a game
For me it's something sexual
I've never kicked a ball
Except for some testicles
So I hope you know a medical professional
'Cause I'm looking for somebody to deck, and you're eligible
A dodgy fucker, call me Terry Venables
I put an end to more bloody cunts than the 
Wrecking your heart
No, not a chance
I'll break you down like Chrouchies' robot dance

England, England
Come on England
E-N-G... L... A, oh
G... L... A...
E-England!

Oi
Be quiet, never mind three lions on my shirt
I've got four tigers and a bottle opener
I'm hoping that this year we'll be lucky
But I know we won't really, so I bet against us at the bookies
And if I win, I spend it all on beer
It costs lots of dosh to get hammered, that's 
Every four years I brought beers
And supported my sporting peers with roars and cheers
Even Gazza couldn't cry more tears
When the other side score
I'm like "Oh dear!"
When the game's on Radio 5, you'll see
I'm like Wayne Rooney's face, I'm all ears

England, England
Come on England
E-N-G... L... A, oh
G... L... A...
E-England!

We're from the place where the players play in shirts and skin
It's taking part that counts, but it wouldn't hurt to win
But when we talk about shirts and skins
We mean skinheads, Ben Sherman shirts and 
Balls are gonna get swiftly kicked
Right back to 1966
Although I don't condone hooliganism
Because I'm every single finger 
Listen, I'm an Englishman, I drink tea and eat crumpets
But when I see a foreigners' face, I have to thump it
British brawlers are broader than drunkeds
So you'll get kicked more than the big bit on a drum kit

England, England
Come on England
E-N-G... L... A, oh
G... L... A...
E-England!

Get me some 
Then let's go hunting for the huns in the 
We're forty folks with bigger tummies than a bloody dance team
George Best, Bobby Charlton, Jimmy Greaves
We've had some flippin' wicked in the English leagues
John Terry, Gareth Barry, Leighton Baines
Aaron Lennon, , David James
Ashley and Joe Cole, Glen and Adam Johnson
Think we haven't got a chance?
Then you're chatting nonsense
From Carrick to , we're gonna carry the flag
Down to South Africa, we fracking batter ya

England, England
Come on England
E-N-G... L... A, oh
G... L... A...
E-England!




 Dear Alan Johnson

We're against the extradition of Gary McKinnon
Not letting it happen to him
He's a valuable Briton, a man with a gift
And we're standing around while they're banishing him?
There's the evidence, where's the terrorist?
Is America pissed 'cause he damaged their image?
It's hardly the baddest of sins, is it? Admit it
Grab a pen, hand me the petition
To stick the extradition act in the bin
I'm not having that - take a fragile man from his habitat
As a matter of fact, such a talented hacker
Should have a salary at NASA
But no salary, just a cell
I really think justice just as well'd be
Served up in Great Britain
Where McKinnon can be with his family
But apparently a British citizen
Isn't considered innocent if Uncle Sam disagrees
Well Dan disagrees
I'm demanding Gary's release
Put your hands up and be counted
'Cause we are demanding Gary's release

Free, free Gary McKinnon
Free, free Gary McKinnon

Look: I see Gmail peeping at my e-mail
But I doubt they're going to see jail
If we let them take him, we've failed
The train to justice derailed
Doesn't matter if he's male or female
Disabled, Asian
We need to rail against the veiled pretense
How can we let them prevail?
Read the details - extradition
A one way system against tradition
If an American did it
He'd never be sent to prison in Britain
So if they reckon they're getting McKinnon
They better be kidding, innit
Pester your local politician
To petition to abolish it
And prevent this horrible predicament
Use common sense, not ignorance
Not submission to a hegemony:
There's the prisoner, now where's the money?
What's the difference
Has anybody got permission to wreck somebody?
Watch and listen:
So the Pentagon's
Defences weren't working as they're meant to work
They were happy as Larry
That's 'til Gary gathered they were hackable actually
And yes, he acted silly
But imagine if the act was military
He could have smashed security to pieces
Wreaking a national emergency
But he didn't, 'cause he isn't a criminal
But a fantastic Asperger's geek

Free, free Gary McKinnon
Free, free Gary McKinnon
Free, free Gary McKinnon
Free, free Gary McKinnon

Yours sincerely
Dan Bull




 First there were Freestyle 1
Then there were Freestyle 2
After that, Freestyle 3
And then came Freestyle 4
Freestyle 1 was mediocre
Freestyle 2 was okay
Freestyle 3 was quite good
And Freestyle 4 was great
This song's a bit short, um
Um, doesn't really matter, does it?
Next




 FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS

Look, fuck buddies, I want to be fuck buddies
Turn the subwoofer up in the trunk and bump uglies
Give me a hug please, I hold a little too long
I'm coming on a little too strong
You're getting blushed cheeks, so we'd better move on
Get a move on, I'm in above my head like a bouffant
Take too long and I'm afraid you've gone
And I'll have lost another lady, but gained another new song

Yes, let's be friends with benefits
My love life's suffering a deficit
Let's be friends with benefits, friends with benefits

I've never been especially eloquent
I'm as elegant as an eccied elephant
My etiquette is evidently ever in development
But when I'm in bed then I'm in my element
I promise, honest, we'll listen to some Ella
Fitzgerald then we'll get it on with the leather whips
The morning after the night before we caved in
Cavemen and cavewomen craving the fornication
I'm never sure if it's safe but I'd say that it calls for some glorification

Yes, let's be friends with benefits
Because I'm ever such a clever dick
Let's be friends with benefits, friends with benefits
Yes, let's be friends with benefits
My love life's suffering a deficit
Let's be friends with benefits, friends with benefits

There's so much history to tip-toe around
It's hard to keep afloat when the ship's going down
Once we danced at the disco in town, with both our hips going round

I realised through seeing your eyes, it was the genesis
Of the end of friends with benefits
I'd been increasingly feeling affectionate
It seemed that revealing my secret would get a kiss
So I leaned for the hell of it
And you ripped the beating thing
From my chest and then severed it
You're a prejudiced feminine supremacist
Nevertheless you're getting sex from your nemesis

Let's not be friends with benefits
Because I'm ever such a clever dick
Let's not be friends with benefits
Because we'll never hear the end of it




 Shoutout to YouTube’s official recommended copyright-free
Audio Library for this amazing instrumental
One of over seven hip-hop instrumentals in the Audio Library

Dear YouTube, this here’s to you
To tell you that your new rules are poo-poo
I don’t know who does your business stuff lately
But it’s an understatement that they’ve pissed us off greatly
Redirecting funds from the kids who have made you
And giving them straight to the pricks in the grey suits
That couldn’t give a fuck for the YouTube community
For a quick buck, there’s nothing that they wouldn’t do to me
NerdCubed got struck for publishing a photo
That contained nothing but his own fucking logo
My mate Gavin got caught making wealth
For using music that he stole from himself
Boogie hates it too, though he may not be connected
But when the walls fall down, he’ll be affected
With none of us protected, we’re on some Wild West shit
But with an automated sheriff, no-one gets arrested
(EGHH!) INFRINGING CONTENT DETECTED!
I suggest you don’t even bother to contest it

This is the winter of our discontent
Where Google gives consent
For you to nick content
From YouTubers too puny to put up a defence
They’re glued; stuck in cement
It’s too tough to prevent
This is the winter of our discontent
Copyright trolls roll up and we are stiffed on rent
This is the winter of our discontent
Ideally you’d give back every stolen cent

It’s like a labyrinth of licenses and lies insisting
I have nicked shit but I’ll fight life and limb to lift it
I know I might have the littlest voice
But I will always call bullshit if given the choice
We can only make change with enough noise
So let me demonstrate how simple the system is to exploit
(One) First find a YouTuber who you want to screw up
(Two) Pick a new video they’ve done or one that blew up
(Three) Submit a copy to the CMS stash, click
You’ll earn cash quick the minute that it matches
The paper’s taken from the creator that made it straight away
Without the need to even briefly speak to people face to face
You can just take them on a Kafkaesque paper chase
Because there’s no accountability within the database
So if they’re making complaints, you can ignore these
And keep on earning from their work for up to four weeks
When the four weeks is up, you just release the claim
Keep the change and start the whole thieving scheme again
It’s easy taking candy from a baby, piece of cake
Google don’t give a fuck, they get their profit either way


Somehow you managed to put out a statement
That brushed aside every single last complaint, look:
You didn’t mention your system dismisses fair use
Or how we can reclaim our redirected revenues
That guilty until proven innocent is an affront
And that to prove your innocence can take several months (cunts)
Nah, you just published a puff piece
If I’d point out animal abuse, you’d say “Look at these puppies :)”
Game publishers have explicitly stated
They don’t want to claim on any Let’s Plays created
They’re actually pissed off about the changes
Just as much as we are, you don’t have to go to Cambridge
University to see it’s proven universally
Your circuitry needs urgent work to cease us losing permanently
It’s news worthy of a parody, Ron Burgundy
We’re swirling in a purgatory that’s worthy of East Germany
The Berlin Wall is like the strikes we’re receiving
Now where’s David Hasselhoff when you need him?
This wall is obviously going to fall before we stop
So you might as well call it off, Mister Gobrachev
I used to love YouTube and what it stood for
But good Lord, now the scrap heap is all it’s good for


Independent YouTubers made YouTube
Then YouTube got huge and shafted them up the arse
On behalf of the traditional dinosaur entertainment industry
Keeping us locked in the 20th century since the 20th century
Thanks, so much… Bellends

 Never been a fellow to be down with the G’s
Hardly ever collect felonies out on the street
My criminal record took minimal effort
To scribble and get all it down on a sheet
Me, I can do without the police
See, I’m a dude renowned to be tedious
No pissing about, I’m serious
I really just sit around on a seat
Read a book, put it down, have a wee
Til I feel I’ve had enough then I slouch in my PJs
These days when I’m counting my sheep
It takes me ages drowsing to sleep
Feel I’m thousands of feet out of my league
Like a floundering dinghy down in the deep
People shouting at me I’m not allowed on a beat
But there’s four times more that’ll tell me I’m sweet
Found my release when I bought me a mic
And recorded a tight lyric down on a beat
With the sound so loud that the speakers melt with the heat
Cos’ I’m Dan to the B, 1 2 I’m counting to three
Then I want you to bounce to the beat
From the North to the West to the South to the East
We can all get well rowdy
I oughtn’t lie, I mean demographically
There’s a hypothesis I support that I am the
More privileged in all of society
Quite unlike the baller I try and be
I was born in a nice region
And brought up politely
So I was taught to mind my P’s and Q’s
And make way for OAPs in queues
I’m a decent dude, peaceful too
But on a beat I speak with lethal truth
This sequel to my debut album’s a way to tell them the good news
That I’m a middle class kid from the midlands
Less “Safe” more like “How You Diddling”
I’m like a polo without the middle in
More whole than the hole to fill it in
Though I’m a bitter kid, just a little bit
Bringing mint lyrics but no-one’s listening
But I’m in the zone, coveting the throne
Not going to give it in
Gloves coming off and I’m boxing until I win
Watch when I’m in the ring
Roundhouse my doubts, popping them in the chin
Plot thickening along with the smoke
But I’m not going to choke
I’ve got Ventolin
Like when I kicked my bong and it broke
It allowed me the freedom to breathe the air again
And now that I’m clean
And the songs that I wrote then are out and they’re seen
I am proud to be me
You could tell when I’d been chilling out with some weed
I couldn’t leave the house, you could smell the febreze
Now an evening in town I’m a demon
Downing indecent amounts of Ribena
Til I’m down on my knees and in pieces
Weeping, shouting “Help me, please”
But when I’m having doubts about my belief
I just tell myself that I’m proud to be me
My CD won’t get me a mortgage
That’s because you pricks haven’t bought it
Five pound and you couldn’t afford it?
Just copped the download and ignored it
I believe in the scene as much as I believe OJ Simpson was innocent
Been a bit of a geek holed up
And now the whole scene’s looking at me but hold up
I’m going to the mountain
When I come back I’ll be ten times better
Backpack on my back like I’m going on an outing
I’m not going on an outing
I’m going to the mountain
I’m going to the mountain again
Cos’ I’ve got to top my last album, impress the doubters again
And at this rate it won’t be out till 3010
So you can smile for a while but know when I’m back from the mountain
You’re going to hear the sound of a mentalist lyricist crowned as the best
For now I’m allowing the stress
Messing around doing an impression and sounding like Ghetts
Down on the best track to ever spin around in your decks
I’m bound to impress with the rowdiest set coming louder than jets
Going over your head to the mountain again, I’m putting in a thousand percent
Umm… I’ve forgotten the lyrics to the next bit so bear with me
I got them here, pop ’em up on the screen… to remind myself
Ahh… this bit’s good, this bit’s good
I ain’t mastered my craft yet
But the more time in the mountain, the better the tracks get
Improvement’s the key
What I do with the beats
Leaves you with a completely snapped neck
I’ll do rap til I take my last breath
Whether or not I’m getting a fat cheque
I vent my thoughts with a black pen, record
Then you’re all like “Did you hear what Dan said?”
No metaphor, that man’s stressing more than Ghetts
And that takes some doing
I’m boiling up the frustration brewing
Making you and your mates listen to it
It’s amazing the way that I do it
I hate to ruin your fun
But you and your dumb crew aren’t making the grade
Improve it
Elevation? Been there, done it
I planted my flag at the summit
Stood astride the mountain
The tiger’s crouching, now the dragon is coming
You ragamuffins standing for nothing
Your standard of stanzas is rubbish
I’m standing above at the foot of the mountain
I’m rambling up, any fuckers are doubting
I hand them a pounding
Hand me a bucket, it’s chucking it down sick
Look around, prick
You wanted something that sounds sick?
You’ve found it
Haven’t got to dumb it down
Ignorant listeners are gonna tell I got it down to a T
Who’s putting in the work like a Sherpa up a mountain?
It’s me
I’m a rap god, rap god
It isn’t all that difficult to rap fast… is it?




 It's Garen, The Might of Demacia
The type of knight, To strike and batter you
Without batting an eyelid
In fact, I couldn't be happier
Than when defending the kingdom
From endless enemy minions, They're barely a hindrance
So bring them, They're giving me income
I am the Epitome, a Shield and Steel clashing Symphony
I stand ready to protect our land and battle the Infamy
Appearance tough, I use the Perseverance buff
To heal in the back of the Battlefield
Can you hear me clear enough?
To the field of justice
I'll cut you up like Peter Sutcliffe
You'll wet your pants, As if you've had your ruptured
I'm propping the whole team up like a Buttress when i rush cliques
I'll roughly rip you up in cooking they call it rustic
I'm a Warmonger, I Don the Warmong's and Forge onward
Full force, Til' you're Conquered, Plonker
I lead the damn charge, Ripping down your ramparts
No doubt this man's hard, The Leader of the Dauntless Vanguard
In the king's name, I bring flames without delay
Victory awaits each day i make these scoundrels pay
I hurt the vile scourge, Killing accursed villains
I'm present at your death, Your final breath
Like a nurse from Macmillan
I Lead the League of Legends
Allegiance Deep Embedded In my Regiments
As each of my Legions Reach for Excellence
I Lead the League of Legends
Allegiance Deep Embedded In my Regiments
As each of my Legions Reach for Excellence
For Demacia
We Forge Onward




 EA (huh)
More like GA
Y?

The Family Research Council are doubtful
Of anything but conventional spousal arousal
The downfall of society is gay gay games
It's like the KKK came at gays
In the lamest of ways, laying the blame on EA
Aiming their flames in their face, but they have made a mistake
The very basic aim that makes a game a game is choice
So if you take the choice away, then what's the flaming point?

It is okay to go gayming
Whatever pushes your buttons
It is okay to go gayming
Hey, it's just co-operative play

There's gays in cinema, there's gays in literature
There's gays in nature, even gay general practitioners
Folks go for ovaries or are testicular particular
So isn't prohibiting it a little bit ridiculous?
To get your knickers in a twist over someone else's
Thinking too much about whose bum they're pals with
You waste your days away complaining about trousers
And who pulls them down, is there something you should tell us?

It's okay to go gayming
Whatever pushes your buttons
It is okay to go gayming
Hey

If Jesus was a gamer, he'd play Mass Effect
And the fact that there was gayness wouldn't make him that upset
See, he'd be more inclined to deplore the kind of bigotry
That enforces "don't ask, don't tell" inside the military
And that's the thing, I see you righteously fight for guidance
But on gratuitous violence then you are silent
But unlike the Rebel Alliance your petty defiance
And whether it's pious will die under the light of science (ah)

Because it is okay to go gayming
Whatever pushes your buttons
It is okay to go gayming
Hey
It's okay




 Emergence day emergency, thunder sounded
And a hundred thousand locust rose up from underground
The invasion managed to create a manic state of panic
They did damage and it made a devestated planet
Today was savage, the latest in a spate of clashes
Between invader and remains of man that came from ashes
See Marcus Fenix in Jacinto penitentiary
Dominic Santiago enters then he sets him free
To defend against the horde he brought all sorts of awesome weaponry
Bring all your forces forward, your corpser's dead to me
Him and Dom find Kim and Carmine and together they took
A look around for Alpha Squad to get the resonator
A sniper snipes Carmine right in the head and later
They catch the Cole Train and press on the accelerator
Seeders block the transmission, nearly stopped the damn mission
Is that the Hammer of Dawn that Dom is brandishing?
Every soldier's ambition is to fire one, a line of lightning
Striking right in from the sky, you're gone
Look, there's Baird and a couple of redshirts, hmm
I wonder which one of them will be dead first?
It can't be Kim, can it? that man's put in the legwork
Ooh, feckin' heck, I bet his bloody head hurt!
Now Fenix has seen this and he's pissed in extremist
But needs to just retreat quick lest he gets in deep shit
It's certainly evident he is ready to burn an effigy
But there is a mercenary berzerker lurking in the murk of every turn you step in
One of the perks of military work is getting to murder every enemy ever so cleverly
With the heaviest weaponry

BOOM! HOOAH! We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!
BOOM! HOOAH!
We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!

As the planet plummets ever further into instability
The Gears receive a missive of massive responsibility
To take the resonator, in the face of all futility
And place it in the lethiaimulsion facility
Their aim is to make it to the makeshift bunker
The place where the stranded stay and take this junker
The stranded Franklin says that they can take the tank
But in exchange Cole and Baird must stay to aid the camp
So Dom and Marcus then head off into the darkness
They'll probably end up carcasses, but soldier on regardless
They watch the light and dodge the night using skill
Co-op, cunning and guile style to fight through the kryll
This type of thing takes balls, call it castration
Finally they make it through the horde toward the gas station
It's not quite right the way they use the spotlight
Nah, that kind of ingenuity is fricking godlike
Turning the torch on them, burning and scorching them
Arriving at the fort in time to support the slaughtering
Shoot the guys that aren't human, target neutralised
This brutal life will leave your psyche scarred and brutalised

BOOM! HOOAH! We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!
BOOM! HOOAH!
We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!

With the mining facility in literal proximity
Their ride begins to give off signs of critical toxicity
It's like a syzygy between their fate and electricity
They're lucky the place has pedestrian accessibility
This utility is a subterranean fortress
So they fought hordes til they're deader than this corpser's corpse is
If it's the belly of the beast, the neck's an elevator
It'll need some rennie when they detonate the resonator
The situation's escelating so they'd better get away
The locust horde are gonna have to call a decorator
Ready to let it blow, they can clear the mess up later
But computer says "no, I couldn't get the data"
It's late in the day to call up technical support
But they've already put in far too much effort to abort
But thankfully Baird appears to be somewhat prepared
He found a map and plus just happens to have got it there
He's a proper COG, look at his goggles, hair, and general masculinity
That should be bottled, yeah
There'd be romance between us if he never had a penis
And anyway, his sights are set on finding Adam Fenix
One of the staff of the east barricade academy is-
As well as being Marcus's dad- an apparent genius
So they start for his lab with only half of the manpower they had
These COGs have gotta be mad

BOOM! HOOAH! We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!
BOOM! HOOAH!
We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!

Humanity's panicking there's nobody left to save them
But wait - the COGs are dropping from the sky inside a raven
The finest specimens of homosapiens anatomy
Collectively heading to the east barricade academy
Their aim's to get rid of an alien supremacist
Go back to genesis but - hang on, there's a.. nemacyst
It's gone and shot them with spores, the chopper is lost
The situation's getting proper debauched
It started bad enough but now it's snowballed
They have to battle their way back into the mansion like Toad Hall
Which is a load more difficult than ABC
But luckily they see an APC, but it's DOA, see?
This is just their luck, so Baird and Cole get to business fixing up their truck
They need to bolt quick, as if they bust a nut and blustered right into the middle
Of a clusterfuck, while this is happening there's battling inside the mansion
Marcus regrets bringing his work home like Bryan Cranston
This is a right branston pickle, who'll provide the answers?
While the science is downloading we rely on lancers
It's time to pack your bags tighten up your do-rag
A futuristic 2Pac in a feudalistic gulag
New tactic - taking flight from the pursuit of this big Brumak
The damage is higher than the avarage price is of a new Mac

BOOM! HOOAH! We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!
BOOM! HOOAH!
We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!

Now, act five, an act of desperation
There's a cold train coming so they head to the station
They never had the patience for a first class pass
Besides, that carriage is reserved to carry the light mass
Pulses racing, they will need to bypass the whole bloody station
To survive upon the right track
Marcus and Dom get on with Cole and Baird behind
Crap, the final chapter's not designed to happen like that!
It's time to strike back
General RAAM is going down shafted like Skywalker's right arm
Marcus sees the train is heading straight into a ridge
So he sets the light mass off and takes it to the bridge
Engine, engine, general RAAM
How do you like that light mass bomb?
When that train goes off the track
Sssskrak-a-rakk-a-rrrakkacratch one grub
BOOM, shake shake shake the room
BOOM, shake shake shake the room
BOOM, shake shake shake the room
Tick, tick, tick, boom

HOOAH! We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!
BOOM! HOOAH!
We are the Gears of War
Come on and ask us what the motherfuck we're here for!




 Monopoly was not for me, chess made me stressed out
So the only way I could get down was with pocket electronics and bleeps
Ever since my Game Boy made toys obsolete
I've been a well behaved boy that played inside and stayed off the street
Yes, I got my electric shocks from Tetris blocks and Mario Land
Though there wasn't much room for much but mushrooms I was the man, man
With a pad in my hand, hammering at it while eating my breakfast
Being the best - that was the plan, beating the rest and leaving them breathless
Please believe me, nobody could beat me at Tetris
I fucking rock, dropping blocks like heads off chopping blocks, I was on some next shit
And I've still got a flame for puzzle games like HD Hexic
But when the PC came my gaming tastes became eclectic

This day's grim (it's raining), it's raining
What wonderful weather for gaming
The sun's blazing (the sun's blazing) so let's stay in
It's wonderful weather for gaming

I was the geeky one, I really wanted a PC CD-ROM, then got it
Eight meg of RAM, a CRT screen, she was some top kit
Free moments were devoted to keystrokes and the odd click
Far more into dark forces than even the Star Wars Kid
And Civilization II's a brilliant game that you really should play and I still do today
Computer games improve your brain, it's proven, mate
So if you behave in stupid ways then please refrain from blaming GTA
I really hate excuses, I may just shoot my teacher's face
Nah, I'm already embroiled in getting these Tesla coils
Ready in my base
The Russians are coming with trucks full of gunmen, I need to be safe
But maybe the Green Beret could lead the way and see us through
At least til we replace the PC games with PS2

This day's grim (it's raining), it's raining
What wonderful weather for gaming
The sun's blazing (the sun's blazing) so let's stay in
It's wonderful weather for gaming

Taking control of somebody else's console with no remorse
I was so debauched, my only thoughts were total scores on Tony Hawk's
Or running amok in Smuggler's Run, smuggling guns and drugs for fun
And pulling a gun on any NPC I see or stumble upon
GTA 3 made me inclined to kill repeatedly
The spinal chills of Silent Hill are still in my mind and creeping me The fuck out, look out! Pull out your sawn-off shotgun
'Cause there's a hot zombie nurse that wants to hurt you and cut off your oxygen
But as much as asphyxiation may be lots of fun
I've got a crush, a fixation with PlayStation - I'm in love
So I said to the PS2, "me and you need a breather"
Then in three clicks I'd ordered an Xbox 360 off eBay

This day's grim (it's raining), it's raining
What wonderful weather for gaming
The sun's blazing (the sun's blazing) so let's stay in
It's wonderful weather for gaming

So we switched teams to the 360, glitch free
Lots of slick features - HD, HDD, I don't miss leads
Gears is my gear but I gets my hits from Hitman
The BioShock has Mass Effect as I sink into Oblivion
Splinter Cell's mint as well and Rainbow Six takes no prisoners
It's the business - and the cover system's fucking wicked!
Ducking and chucking a frag, blind fire from behind piles of rubble and zipping them up in a bag
I'm loving the lack of health packs - putting a plaster on a fracture or a shrapnel gash
What the hell's that? In the new generation of computer gaming
You hold the left trigger half way down or let the computer do the aiming
So what are you complaining for? (The Forza scoreboard's been reset!)
Shut up and improve your Gamerscore before you get the dreaded Red Ring of Death

This day's grim (it's raining), it's raining
What wonderful weather for gaming
The sun's blazing (the suns blazing), David's raiding
It's wonderful weather for gaming




 Hmmm
How did I get here? Why am I naked?
I'd better climb and decide what my fate is

Don't ask why I'm holed in a cast iron cauldron
While holding a massive hammer, that's how I roll, bruh
No exposition needed (uh-uh), this expedition's heated (oh!)
And that's no surprise considering the thing in which I'm seated
We each make decisions in life
We probably wouldn't repeat if we were given them twice
So now I'm naked, and I'm livin' inside a great big cooking pot
And keeping in mind these limitations, I am looking hot
While redefining what it means to be a mountaineer
Keep on climbing, keep on trying, I need to get out of here
I won't cease until I meet the sky above, goal is:
To shoot for the moon, that's why they call me Buzz Cauldron

I'm a guy inside a pot, climbing up
The side of a pile of stuff
'Til I arrive at the top, try not to look down
(Down, down, down) It's quite a drop!
I'm just a guy inside a pot, climbing up
The side of a pile of stuff
'Til I arrive at the top, try not to look down
(Down) It's quite a drop!

Quick, you better get a grip, 'cause if you slip then maybe you'll
Release the sledgehammer, like your name is Peter Gabriel (ah)
Climbing up Solsbury Hill requires control and the skill
Of a bloke that's stuck inside a cauldron, holding a real
Big tool that's unsuitable for such a challenge
But it's bloody beautiful, refuse to fall, I can manage
To keep my balance like I'm doing ballet on a Segway
All upper body strength, so what if I skip leg day?
Not just anybody can get over it with Bennett Foddy
Again and again, you're in the belly of a Teletubby
What's the surprise at the end, is it a belly rub?
Don't tell me, buddy, but I'll just guess it is very funny

I'm just a guy inside a pot, climbing up
The side of a pile of stuff
'Til I arrive at the top, try not to look down
(Down, down, down) It's quite a drop!
I'm just a guy inside a pot, climbing up
The side of a pile of stuff
'Til I arrive at the top, try not to look down
(Down) It's quite a drop!

Why did I make this? (What?) This horrible hike
Up an impossible mountain? I could have made something you would have liked
And since success is delicious, that would have been wise
Instead I must confess: That this isn't nice (no)
It tastes of bitterness, it is capricious
It sets setbacks for the ambitious
It lacks lenience, it's bracing and inhumane
But not everyone is the same
I created this game for a certain kind of person
To hurt them

Why am I naked?




 The closer to the poles of the Earth you go
Or ascend heights, the temperature turns low
Ten thousand years ago, the world was colder than it is today
Britain immersed in snow
Glaciation changed the face of the countryside
To become more like the Earth we know
Working slowly, giant hunks of ice
Cut and slide then push aside tons of stone
Signs say at the time of the ice age
A third of the Earth's surface totally snowed over
Then the Fahrenheit rose, polar caps and ice flows
Capsized, and shrank in size loads
Today the only glaciers remain
On high latitudes or low altitude terrain
So though only a tenth of the globe's glaciated
There's occassional formations close the the equator
See the way that they're made in this how-to guide
Snowflakes accumulate in mountainsides
The weight creates pressure
Making a firm and dense substance that's termed by the name of firn
If the ice stays frozen as snow falls
Then it snowballs, grows and grows more
And as the mass increases
Gradually gravity grabs massive pieces and releases them
Woe betide anything in the way
As they slowly slide lower and erode it away
With an amazing grace
Glaciers patiently changed the landscape on a grand scale

Glaciers, how long will they stay here?
Glaciers, how long will they stay here?

Two major stages make up glacier formation
And they're named accumulation and ablation
Accumulation happens in the winter, it gets bigger
While ablation is the inverse
It shrinks year to year every summer, then returns
And that's the basic annual changes that happen to a glacier
But on a grander timescale
The average size fails to remain the same
And changes at a snail's pace
Now I don't wanna get too technical
So let me just explain the basics
And then I'll change the subject
If you take away ablation from accumulation
Then the data you remain with is the glacial budget
If the figure's bigger than zero, it's advancing
But if it's less than, it's a negative regime
The level will decrease until everything retreats
And all we're left with is a petty little piece of what it used to be
Experts agree that greenhouse gas such as CFCs
Mean the atmosphere's heat's increasing
Leading to deeper seas, the decline in ice
Causing rising tides on shorelines worldwide

Glaciers, how long will they stay here?
Glaciers, how long will they stay here?




 My name's Kaitlin
I've been away since this time last year
Ages and ages
I've been abroad
I't been a long road
But I'm getting bored
So I've got aboard and gone home
Get through the door
I don't really know
Where anybody is
As if there's nobody home
Hopefully though
I'll find a clue
It better be a joke they're trying to do

I've gone home
And I'm on my own
I've gone home
And I'm all alone

I've been around everywhere
Nothing found yet
I've looked outside
I've looked downstairs
I've looked upstairs
Tell me now where?
I'm well scared
This is getting pretty out there
Where's Mom and Dad
Where's Samantha
Somewhere in the mansion
There's an answer
Have they left?
Are they dead from cancer?
Kidnapped by the Feds or gangsters?
I'm wracked with a sense of dread
So deep i could believe it was a necromancer
There's an atmosphere that's noxious
Something bleak and evil watches
But there's nothing here but sheets and boxes
Nobody's holding people hostage
I just need the key
To reveal each secret
Like a seasoned locksmith
 X2
I've gone home
And I'm on my own
I've gone home
And I'm all alone

I'm losing my mind in a psycho house
So I pray no lights go out
It's just me, my lone self
No family, no life, no sound
No clues so I know nought
And I'm bloody terrified on my own, HELP
All I have is letters and scraps
No weapons except for this map
I'm desperate for something better than that
If I have any chance to defend from attacks
Not there is a hatch
To enter the attic
It's the place that I've left to the last bit
Now I've got the key
I'm prepared to get past it
I need to know either way whether it's tragic
Or whether my head has gone mad
And so I hold on to my breath
And then grab it
 X2
I've gone home
And I'm on my own
I've gone home
And I'm all alone




 Yeah
My name is Michael, landed and titled
Think of a crime, and it probably was my fault
But now I cleaned up my act, call me Lysol
I used to pull off heists then I got out of the cycle
I wasn't stopping 'til I got the bills
For a property in Rockford Hills
But now I rock the mils and the mansion
Looking for the answers at the bottom of a bottle
As I pop the pills, for reals
I live a life of luxury, but trust me, I'm the man it sucks to be
Look and see, my family's dysfunctional
Sometimes I feel like I really want to punch them all
My son's a ball of blubber, about as awful as my daughter
Or her mother, Or her mother's other lover
Motherfucker
Suffering a midlife crisis, but have you seen how ridiculous my wife is?
You shouldn't be surprised what the mind of a man does
To hide from the madness of Amanda's
Even my analyst is struggling to handle this
So it's about time I went back to being the protagonist
(Yeah)

There's only one philosophy I follow
And that's the mighty American dollar
There's only one philosophy I follow
And that's the mighty American dollar

Yo
They call me Franklin, I'm all about the Benjamins
I spend on anything that's got a revving engine in(vroom)
I never had a family, except my gang and me
I was educated at the Hard Knock Academy
But gang banging was an absolute calamity
They handcuffed and chucked me in the slammer
It was agony
Now I'm free, being a repo man is my reality
But on this salary I can't afford a calorie
And as I can't gather enough food to eat
From Vespucci Beach, then I might resort to felony
Felling an enemy or anyone offending me
Befriending people who inevitably will depend on me
But if I end up in a feud with Lamar
I'll lick off his top, like a Cuban cigar
I'm the dude with the car, a superstar
In a street fight I'll pull off a hadouken
Rah!
You might find me in the strip club, bruh
But I didn't come to get my dick sucked, nah
I'm a hip hop star
Blood? Crip? Not moi
I'm the top dog, sit, Chop, ha
It's like this x2
Look!


Nah
My name is Trevor
I live inside a trailer in the desert, where I blaze the chrystal method
This unhygienic lifestyle only takes a little effort
But the cash I had I've gone and wasted it, I'm reckless
(Rah)
I haven't got a pound to my name
So it's time to get out of the county of blaine
I used to fly a plane, now I just fry my brain
Howling at the Moon, you can assume that I'm insane
Like my neighbour Ron, I don't know what page he's on
Paranoid conspiracies, I really believe his brain is gone
Any plan I make, something has to spoil it
I can't fit this fucking foot down the toilet
I've got a penchant for throttling a pensioner
Then grabbing a can of petrol and notching up the temperature
I've got a nervous twitch that's quite violent
So I'm doing suicidal stunts in my y-fronts
I fell out with Michael, we never quite saw
Eyeball to eyeball, but now it's time for
Us to re-unite, grab the shotties and the rifles
And set the town alight in a giant fireball


Yo
The three of us are so grand thefting
The best in the biz no damn question
Man it's sexy, straddling a jet ski
Ramming it at jet speed
Get me?
What you doing in our neck of the woods?
You best be checking the HUD
Cause in a second your blood will be flecking the mud
When we bust you by the lip
Take all your money and then customize a whip
How can we justify this shit? We must be kind of sick
That's why we keep the piece that's the most trusty by the hip
So pull the map out while we pull the strap out
POW POW 'Til the po-po go and black out
Dropping from the chopper then we grab a couple hostages
We're hot dog ... sausages
We trade stocks and cribs, take shots at pricks
Bury their heads in the dirt, ostriches
The unholy trinity in your vicinity
Sinning with a seriously symbiotic synergy
We're the three similarly sinister Gs
Each sending the cinema screen into the cemetery
Cynically, with no sympathy seen
So simmer down and listen to this symphony please
To put it simply, police, are just some pimply sleazes
We'll pimp as we please and so we send them to sleep
Yes!

There's only one philosophy we follow
And that's the mighty American dollar
There's only one philosophy we follow
And that's the mighty American dollar




 It's been ages since I made a tune this raw
But it's time to draw a line in the music hall
I'm fed up of what's not got in the news reports
Daily slayings, flayings, what do they do this for?
Planes drop bombs on those with no food or water
Ha, even Sun Tzu never knew such war
They changed the rules so this behavior's duly lawful
The human form's morphed to become truly awful
There's apathy from who's not involved but soon we all will
And when it happens to your family, perhaps that's when you'll be thoughtful
A newly orphaned you mourns for the time
You could have given a shit who was led to the slaughter
Mutilated with new forms of brutal torture
Just for living on one side of a stupid border
Who'd have thought the conspiracies of a new world order
Were actually true? Cos me and you are all just

Guilty, guilty
Not caring quite enough

The blame doesn't lay just on governments and militants
The population's got the plague of indifference
And nowadays how can you claim ignorance
When you've got the wide world at your fingertips?
A single click can lead the way to a million hits
But we need to change a Twitter status to a physical thing
Quit the wishful thinking, sitting like an invalid
And stop being a clicktivist, get up and light the tindersticks
Don't just sit through Shoah, Night and Fog and Schindler's List
Things are happening this minute while you reminisce
Ring your politicians, make them say they'll follow wishes
And if they break their promise take away their office quick, they're




 Listen up, brother
Got a little rhyme for you
But I gotta tell you
I ain't no durn singer
I'm a gunslinger

Who's a better gunslinger?
That's a humdinger
Blood blister on my one finger from triggers
And I don't hunt deer
So chump, here's something I'd like to advise
Better run for your life if you'd like to survive in the frontier
It's like you drunk beer, brain ain't configured
A word to the wise and your mind will become clear
Bright as the lights on the rides of a fun fair
So come bring your Jesse James and Billy the Kid
I'll make a mess of their brains and fill 'em with lead
And I will until every damn villain is dead
Then I'm bringin' the sheriff a bag full of their heads
Handlin' any man that is plannin' to stand in my path
Because I'm heavy-handed with every bandit I wrangle with
And we're in a century that hasn't any ambulances
So best pack your best brandy and bandages
When I'm rat-a-tat-tattin' on my gatling guns
The blast attacks faster than my battlin' puns
A lemat in my one hand and another in my other
So get runnin' for cover, you would you rather be buggered?
Shots, I'm lickin' off like the sugar on my cherry strudel
I'm quick on the draw, call me Mary Doodles
I'm gettin' reward money to bury people
And as a result, I never need to be very frugal
'Less you want your tooth pulled, pay the dentist
I make rackets as if it's an angry game of tennis
Don't hate the player, no, hate the business
I make a livin' from wanted posters: Jay McGuiness

Forget a hook
I ain't no durn singer
Brother, look
I'm just a gunslinger
So forget a hook
I ain't no durn singer
Brother, look

I'm just gonna get some dynamite and then I'll light my pipe
And when the timing's right, I'll set the skies alight
Kind of like Juarez calls for Silas Greaves
To make you fall like a pile of leaves
Shootin' line after line after line of thieves
And I've touched more gold than a miner's sleeves
When I wield dual revolvers, you'll feel the coldness
Once in a blue moon, I'm using my holsters
Shootin' my Colt, I'm too skilled to falter
Is it any wonder saloons here are closed?
When you bring a whole platoon filled with soldiers
I barbecue fools, a new meal for vultures
High noon, we're overdue for elevenses
I left the saloon, it was strewn with your severed limbs
Bringin' just a shoe to a shootout
To kick your booty so brutally, you'll never get my boot out

Forget a hook
I ain't no durn singer
Brother, look
I'm just a gunslinger
So forget a hook
I ain't no durn singer
Brother, look
I'm just a gunslinger

I'm just a mean-ass gunslinger
And I guess that's all I'll ever be
But lemme tell you
That's all I ever wanna be
A mean-ass gunslinger, pardner
Beg your pardon, ma'am




 This is a hold-up !
Ten Million

I've got a Double Daryl shotgun, pointed at your bottom
Now hand over the Diamond Play Button
'Cuz his facemask's stainless steel
It's attached to his face like a grapefruit peel
Dat face reveal's gonna make 'em squeal
But when's it gonna be ?
Patient, we'll need to negociate a deal
Then maybe we'll see about making it real
He's a mystical being from space
Even his family hasn't seen his face
And I know I shouldn't tell you this, he'll be fumin'
But he looks just like a typical human
And assuming you didn't figure it out already
HE REALLY LOVES HIS TEDDY
When he doesn't get a hug he becomes unsteady
Vomit on his sweater, mom's spaghetti
You're getting soaked no stopping the leak
Like a toddler reluctant to sleep
Acting as if he's got nothing to eat
But he's one of the top, the elite
I got as many views in my career
As Delirious has just got in a week
You better shuch up when I drop on the beat
Because even though he can't properly speak
He will climb greatness mountain and then grab
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak
He can play Gmod Hide and Seek
With Vanoss then switch up to Hide and Shriek
Everyday's Friday the Thirteenth, so
Check your sub box first thing, oh
He plus Gmod are peas in a pea pod
Try and stop him and there'll be a season of Jihad
Fighting over who might be the supreme god
They've both never been seen, does it seem odd ?
The Delirious family knows
We're unlike the average joes
Or Mannequin hoes
The insanity shows
No wonder mom and dad are panicking loads
Your'e damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So strap on the mask and gooooo

The moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak
Oh, the moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak

Why so serious, why so blue ?
Ain't H2O Delirious right fo' you ?
Why ? What lenghts could a guy go to
To provide your amusement, acquire those views
In Vinewood driving a Rhino through
Find Shia LeBeouf and call him Shilo Boof
Ahem, that was a typo, oops
No need to correct me you snide lil' douche
Everyone's a critic, the line's so true
When you get what creators online go through
"You're so useless and I'm so cool"
I can hit a low and a high note too
'Scuse me but do I know you ?
Telling me to die, bro, why don't you
SHUCH UP !
You're in serious need of a
TOUCH UP !
I don't meen make up, I mean getting
ROUGHED UP !
SHUCH UP !
If you found that offensive well then
You should have heard what I took out the
ROUGH CUT !
SHUCH UP !
If you don't, I've a prediction
SHUCH UP !
You'll become a survivor victim
SHUCH UP !
Just SHUCH UP ! SHUCH UP ! SHUCH UP !
Just SHUCH UP ! SHUCH UP ! SHUCH UP !
Just SHUCH UP !
Or I'll introduce my foot to your buttocks

The moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak

Boat wrecker, dope peddlar, vogue setter
Go getter, joke teller, so clever
Wana make a video better ?
No pressure
Lol joke the heat's overloading your processor
You're a flat pack hat rack, he's an oak dresser
Don't imitate, come up with your own method
Or even better, just don't ever
Pimpin' out the lo lo with chrome leather
Taking over the show at his own leisure
While I study flows like a professor
We dunno whether dinos had no feathers
But we do know the zero's supposed to be a letter
It's totally an "O" not a number
This is a Courgette, this is a Cucumber
Known as zuchini
Oh 'scuse me, but I'm from overseas, so sue me
Goody two shoes and a blue hoody
Bloody shoes would he choose to be you buddy ? Who ?
True that he's too good he needs to be studied
To discover the gene making movies funny
Ten million subs that'll see YouTube
Then be "Please mummy, we need food"
How can I say this without seeming rude ?
Pff, screw it, you're a penis dude !

The moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak

Lemme begin a rap that's incredibly fast
See me get in and then vanish quicker
Than the fidget spinner fad
MiniLadd's getting really mad, checking the minimap
Like the fella was in Trinidad with a myriad
Of chickens when he meant to be in Chiliad, silly chap
Will he actually get'em back and intact, or be
Picking up a bit of litter and sticking it in a bag
With a death date written on the tag
I know true, it's a sucky task
But somebody's gotta do it so go fetch the hockey mask
That costume's Delirious, don't copy that
Hitting with the impact of a shotty blast
He needs food to bloat up his body mass
And make a meal montage with a Rocky track
One second, he's a fully jolly chap
And the next he's a bloody stroppy twat
And if you haven't ever heard of Batcoon
He's a badass, crime-fighting racoon
Kicking every villain's ass to this rap tune
'Til it make an excuse to leave, and soon
Delirious rhymes with :
Curious, Furious, Spurious and Devine Mysterious Experience
So get down on your knees and beg
With a prayer to the white circle easter egg

The moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak
Oh, the moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak




 Good to meet you, cordial greetings (Hi!)
They call me Gordon Freeman
And up until this morning
I was an ordinary normal human
Eating and reading the ingredients on a box of cereals
Then heading off to the Office of Anomalous Materials
Realise I’m late so I’ll have to catch you later
Gotta catch a train to Black Mesa’s anti-mass chamber
Put on my hazmat in case the vat breaks ‘cause that’s dangerous
You’d have to evade the blast radius of a resonance cascade that’s
The last stage of –
Ah, ahh! It’s . . . it’s actually, it’s actually happening
Th-this is not good! This is – shit
Wake up in the chamber with a bad head
Everybody in the lab dead
I better had fled, this is dead rad
Get it? Dead rad, hit a headcrab
With a crowbar, I’m a lonestar
Yo, guard! Gotta go, but I’ll owe you a postcard
Oh darn! Life is so hard, with no halves
Let alone half, like a diet with low carbs
But I like it so far
Life now has a worth and a purpose
Find out what on earth is occurring
Wipe out any vermin that’s stirring
Fly now to the surface and hurrry
There’s a person that’s lurking, queer
Think I’ve seen him working here
Gee, man, I’m not really certain what he’s observing
But I’m going to persevere, though I’m mere-
Ly an engineer, I’ll end your career

G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Man (And!)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Freeman (Who?)
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Man (And!)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Freeman

Damn, everybody’s after me
Guess that’s the way it has to be
From Black Ops to G-Man and all these dastardly
Bastard beings, masked marines
I’m blasting things with SPAS-12s
Then take a break to recharge my shield and grab health
Electric impulses convulse with the most violent sound
Sending houndeyes to the pound, firing rounds
Sliding round mines, if life has half a meaning, well I’ve found mine
Bouncing through the sky so high that I’m on cloud nine
Low gravity provides some downtime to hit the ground
I am bringing down giants as if they’re fricking houseflies
Hitch a ride inside a monorail car
Swinging off a tentacle like ahhhhhhhh!
I get in the ring with anybody, man, who’s on next?
I’ll wreck you, trekking from the land of Xen to Lambda Complex
Hang on one sec, I think I’ve got the wrong specs
That baby looks gargantuan, these lenses can’t be convex
Imagine the conception; that must have been some sex
Not to mention giving birth to it; how much can bums stretch?
But enough talk of proportions and awkward contortions
To pull the portal shut calls for the goriest abortion

F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Freeman (And!)
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-man (Who?)
F-F-F-F-F-F-F-Freeman (And!)
G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-man




 Look at me!
Dan Bull in your area
My neck has never been hairier

All work and no play makes Dan a dull man
So I took business and pleasure, and had them hold hands
I monetise my hobbies, I like computer games
Rap music, anime to making up stupid names
Now I can work sixteen hours a day
And have sixteen hours of play
Hop in the shower and straight to bed
I make the competition shake their head
Like a wet dog in disbelief seeing what they can get
But come the best at the thing you love best
And the rest is elementary, umm yes, unless
You fail to put the work in, shirking
Jerking yer gherkin then derpin', you're undeserving
Put in the effort and see, how little effort you need
To achieve things effortlessly
It's halftime

It's halftime
Put the kettle on
It's hafltime
Put the kettle on

I bang the beat like a cattle drum
I quit weed when the nettle stung
But I'll never settle some
Blast with a special tongue
I want to rap on every record spun
And set a record for the rapper with the sexiest bum
Is there anyone better? Man, I reckon there's none
But genetically I'm repping my mum
That's where I get my creativity from
She done brung up a son well, didn't she, chum?
When she discovered a bun in the oven, things changed
Quit her career to rerun this kid, raised
Him to be creative, gave him instruments to play with
And pen and paper he could lyrically slay with
I know I say the word 'lyrically' too much
But that's just because I'm lyrically too much
I never keep my privileges subdued, hush
I'm not flossin', I didn't bring my toothbrush
I'm ruthless, like a convertible
Spectacularly secular, you're not convertable
I do my work in full while I'm on the doll
In adversity, I'm the first to be the one to fold
But I still picked a university, I didn't like it
Spending time alone learning this is my shit
I'm a lone ranger that'll occasionally collaborate
And grab a taste of books and open on a random page
I hate to stand on stage, I'm not a spectacle
My view on me is that perform is unrespectable
So I sit at home, building up my text of walls
I've never scratched a deck, I sit and scratch my testicles
Best of all, I can work in my underpants
The last boss I did that to denied another chance
I was out on my own, the way I like it
Spending time alone, learning this is my shit

It's halftime
Put the kettle on
It's halftime
Put the kettle on

Knock, knock! Who's there?
It's only Daniel Bull
That funny rapper with the cracking in his mandible
Maybe I'm becoming Jaws, is that woman yours?
I'm not predatory but she possesses stunning orbs
Ask your mother: is it sons-in-law or son-in-laws
I'm not bothered, I just want to rummage in her drawers
There's something in her form that makes me cuddly and warm
A fuzzy feeling in between my knees, I want to be adored
Hah! I'm the Ian Brown of rap, I like the sound of that
I'm the reason that they put my friggin' town on maps
So unless you pubs got some Nut Brown on tab
It's not particularly likely I'll be out my flat
I'll be at home working, putting the work in
I'm covering another thing, I'm like a merkin
That's urban for stealing the show
I'm so sorry Nastradamus for stealing your flow
I'm really feeling it though, it's exceedingly dope
But even so, I'm eager for a wee, I need to go

It's still halftime
To the Severn Bridge
To the people responsible for the maintenance of the Severn Bridge
It's still there; you must be doing alright
It's halftime




 Dawn
An ancient evil awakens
The Galaxy's here for the taking
We need more than police and a spaceship
To cease the Prometheans claiming it (yeah)
These evil assailants
Are leaving the deepest abrasions
Without delimitations
Now Master Chief has been catching Zs
Since he last was seen on these screens
Now he's back and eager
To blast a piece
At the catastrophe that he sees
We
Thought the Forerunners had all done a runner
But the Covenant are currently ballin' like none other
Bummer
But something doesn't add up there's another species and
They're bringing beastly guns
The scattershot'll splat a lot of meaty chunks
So you better be backing off from the Prometheans, Son
Far more than a Martian war
This calls for the Spartan-IV
No other corps is coming half as raw
Or packing such a frakkin' massive arsenal
Cortana calls who's she askin for?
It's the MC MC styles galore
In a time of war
I'm the one-man remedy and I am called John-117
Back bigger than ever quicker and cleverer
Getting rid of the mess as if I'm an enema

I am bigger than Machinima
Or an IMAX image in a cinema
Though my enemies take no prisoners
I still escape fate like a space John Dillinger

Look, you prat
These are just the facts
Me, I'm rising skyward, thruster pack
And I'm rhyming tight never cut you slack
Your head's just another nut to crack
And when it comes to nuts
I stuffed a sack with cojones galore
Enough to catch me a trophy of war, Custer's hat So if you need a battle rap, this is just the track
Brap
Lyrically killin' the audience
As if I'm bringing an Infinity ordnance
Then I rewind the track respawn the chumps
Just to remind the fact Chief's awesomeness
I brought dreadful news
You're shot to bits
Dead, you lose
Lost, adrift
Reds and Blues, not Bloods and Crips
So I hopped in my Warthog and crushed your whip
Pushed a clip into my rifle
Giving you an eyeful
Of ammunition damaging your vision man, I'm spiteful
The rightful heir to the UNSC, I declare I'm too sexy
When I say "Ho" you say "yes, chief?"
I put the "I" in "chef" and I'm prepping up a recipe
Forget Reach, leave ODST
And go Forward Unto Dawn, you get me?
I should compose me a requiem theme
Nobody'd forget me then, we've
Re-entered the end of the rainbow
Storm warning! Tornado
So you better lay low because I say so
And wait for the payload
Halo
Pay no dividends, take no prisoners
No matter how cray things go, no giving up

I am bigger than Machinima
Or an IMAX image in a cinema
Though my enemies take no prisoners
I still escape fate like a space John Dillinger

If you're an alien or a being upon Earth
I'll battle you on any beat and leave you looking worse
If you're rapping to Infinity
I'll even push it further
This first verse is a precursor...




 He vagado durante tanto tiempo que estoy cansado
Soy un soldado que viaja sin rumbo, donde me lleve el viento
El experimiento ha sido fallido, Cortana me dijo que fue un estallido
No dejo la vida en la que estoy metido
Yo solo quiero descansar un momento
Quiero que me miren como un lider
Quiero que me den lo que me piden
Que nunca me olviden
Quiero terminar, llegar a mi hogar
No queda nada que me intimide
Quiero volver amar
Volver a ver el mar
Mermar el mal
Ser la verdad
Me llamo John el más capaz de borrar toda la oscuridad
He pasado por cada esquina del espacio
He matado con las manos y despacio
He notado los golpes de cansancio
Me domina un demonio que no sacio
Miralo, Cuidado
Directo a su higado
Si quieres morir
Sólo pidelo
Dimelo, soy el fantasma
Repitelo
Me llaman muerte y la muerte no puede ser inferior

Ve lo que vi para creer
Buscando el ¿Cómo? y el ¿Por qué?
De todo lo que les ocurre a los nuestros
Soy la mitad de un hombre
La otra mitad se esconde
Bajo una capa de metal pesado
Prepárate
Si me ves aparecer
Escóndete
Te daré la caza que mereces
No me reces
Soy Jefe Maestro
Seguiré todo recto
Cállate que lo merezco
Destapar toda verdad
Hallare el camino y veré a todo mi pueblo avanzar

Dan Bull
I'm back on the Halo tip
I'm not going to take no lip
When I face an alien invader
I make damn sure that they know this
Fire Team Osiris leaves in T -minus 343
When I said I was ready to fry you believe
I didn't mean Thomas Aquinas, see
With a laser sight Osiris is
Going to blind you between both irises
Anything except perfection on our side
Is nothing but a minor glitch
You might as well lie in a ditch
Hiding, twitching, crying, cringing
Whining, wincing, writhing, flinching
Hi, you're just in time for the lynching
You, Better, Get out the Warzone
Unless you're looking for a way to make powder of your bones
I roll stones
I'm unkillable like Keith Richards
The Covenant's a cover group, I'm culling these bitches
I'm a guardian guarding the garden from garbage
And I'll beg your pardon if you're not
This Spartan's going to pick you off
With firearms, vehicles, armor, clips the lot
Second to second increasing the speed
And I'm teaching a lesson to people that need it
Strategically keeping you guessing
Impressing forever, never knowing when I should leave it

Ve lo que vi para creer
Buscando el ¿Cómo? y el ¿Por qué?
De todo lo que les ocurre a los nuestros
Soy la mitad de un hombre
La otra mitad se esconde
Bajo una capa de metal pesado
Prepárate
Si me ves aparecer
Escóndete
Te daré la caza que mereces
No me reces
Soy Jefe Maestro
Seguiré todo recto
Cállate que lo merezco
Destapar toda verdad
Hallare el camino y veré a todo mi pueblo avanzar




 Your attention, please

When life is blurring you to blindness
Slide the curtain to the side
Move in strides into the light
Observe the views and sights
The dirty beauty oozing through the market
Hurts and soothes your eyes
Are you excited to be starting?
Scuse me, who's this guy?
Hell if I'm sure, but if he's buying
Hell or high water, it'll be mine
And this is my calling; Meaning of life
I live or die for achieving the prize
This is my fort
This is my wall
If you stick inside well it isn't my fault
Your survival here is relying on freelancers like I am
And this is my world

Gloomy safety
Or beautiful danger
The daily mundane streets
Or brutal nature
Be one of the few
That's brave enough
To choose your fate, bruh
Be one of the few
That makes opportunities
And moves the stakes up
Are you a consumer
Or are you a creator
Are you a producer
Or are you a potato
Be one of the few today
To use your labour to your favor
Be one of the few
Generating greater boons to human nature

To leave the fort you need the balls
Proceed to leap from the big wall
Skydive from a highrise
To environments I've never seen before
What the heck happened to Chester Zoo?
The recent recession has wrecked it
Boo
I suggest that it's best to choose
To have a companion next to you
We travel in javelin exosuits
Can't imagine a man that is dressed so cute
Just looking and smelling as fresh as I do
Is essentially sex abuse
Pew Pew!
Forget having one jet, there's two
And another mini set per shoe
'Cause if you messed up the letters in "boots"
You get to "boost"
Yes you do
Now I'm ready for fresh pursuits
More than another quest to fetch the loot
I've come to collect my dues
Your debts are due
And I couldn't be less interested
In your next excuse
Or whether you're destitute
Bereft and stressed as fuque
My intention's to execute
Every threat that's looming
Boom!
Yes my dude

Gloomy safety
Or beautiful danger
The daily mundane streets
Or brutal nature
Be one of the few
That's brave enough
To choose your fate, bruh
Be one of the few
That makes opportunities
And moves the stakes up
Are you a consumer
Or are you a creator
Are you a producer
Or are you a potato
Be one of the few today
To use your labour to your favor
Be one of the few
Generating greater boons to human nature

I can feel the mist, steal a kiss
Fill my chest and chill my breath
Like menthol filter tips
But when my mental skills are tested
Will's unaffected
I've spilled a river of ichor
Lost track of my kills, assists and deaths
Can't measure the pulses I've stilled in this
Wilderness
But I will persist
Until I've fixed and healed the rifts
That still exist, fulfil your wish
Yes, there isn't a lyricist
That's nearing this, so deal with it
A brilliant artist
Getting plenty of Brynnium shards
To bring them to Tarsus
Killing more Scars in shimmering darkness
As if they really were harmless
I'm not hanging back
Stop a Scar attack on my habitat
What a savage act
Flukin have it twat
Dropping Jarra's Wrath
Bruv, I'm grabbing that
They won't have it back
I can adapt
To the situation which we're facing
Just be patient
Swimming through ancient misty caves
In distant places
This is amazing
Quit the switching and changing, stick to your lane
Stay true to the program
Or feel a new definition of pain
Crushed in your suit like an aluminum coke can
Heed the danger warning
It's real, we are not play performing
By the way, say hey to Leanne, Ellie May
Mollie Jane and Jordan
They are awesome
Say no more, son
The rage of the Lord will take the form
Of Shaper Storms
Hurricanes, tornados, gale force winds
Changing falling trees
To paper torn in pieces
Nature reborn a naked fetus
Come face to face with all your fears
Chase the storm and leap in
Choose:

Gloomy safety
Or beautiful danger
The daily mundane streets
Or brutal nature
Be one of the few
That's brave enough
To choose your fate, bruh
Be one of the few
That makes opportunities
And moves the stakes up
Are you a consumer
Or are you a creator
Are you a producer
Or are you a potato
Be one of the few today
To use your labour to your favor
Be one of the few
Generating greater boons to human nature

 I'm a Hanzo main
I'm a Hanzo main
I'm a Hanzo main
Got no mates, I'm a Hanzo main
(Hanzo)

If you stay seated by the river patiently
The bloated bodies of your enemies will float toward the waiting sea
Don't believe it? Wait and see
Learn to seperate haste and speed
And you will take the lead with graceful ease
Strive for perfection in the art of deception
With every death comes honor, with honor, redemption
When he strikes at the heart, his arrow's finding its mark
Truly, true mastery is the highest of arts

Hanzo, the man bow, Samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro
Hanzo, the man bow, Samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro

Oh, he sees that which is unseen
Umpteen hits on anyone deemed unclean
His aim's as straight as a sunbeam
Concealing his footsteps underneath the drum beat (boom)
You've been marked by the dragon
Can't blame the wires when your heart and mind are laggin'
Arteries are pumping hard by the gallon
Synapses fire like you can't quite imagine
Can't rely on spammin' arrows, part time assassin
Target ice and fire like some dark kind of cannon
Marks cannot hide from he who sees through dragon's eyes
Irises and spyglasses are made of the same matter inside
Harnessing simple geometry
To bring his kill count to ridiculous quantities
Now bodies each side are lying horizontally among the leaves
It's time for some Sakuramochi and a nice hot pot of tea

Hanzo, the man bow, Samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro
Hanzo, the man bow, Samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro

A lethal bowman, although some say he's a showman
But he could shoot you through a whole length of a road that's Roman
He'd need a moment to grieve and heed the omen
There's a reason that he chose to leave his family clan to join the Creed of Ronin
People know what brothers are like, bickering and quibbling
But it takes a certain kind of special dedication to kill a sibling
Well Hanzo had to go and do exactly that
And never fully came to terms with that bastard act
Regretted every day, unsatisfied
By the fact that fratricide left a stain through his resume
And no matter what he said or did to repent and pray
He could never take the blemishes away
Like you, when you've been marked by the dragon
Arrow tips split your heart like an atom, look
Sabre toothed tigers never lose sight when the noose tightens, they move silent
Through the moonlight, not too inclined to inquire as to whose side
Are you fighting, should you find this too exciting, I do advise
Keep glued tight to your loose items, I'm rapping-that-fast-that-I-use-hyphens
Better patent that patter in a pattern
As a new type of deep rhyming
Wanna beat it? Huh, please do keep trying

Hanzo, the man bow, Samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro

The man bow (I'm a Hanzo main)
Samurai (I'm a Hanzo main)
Commando (Got no mates, I'm a Hanzo main)

Commando (I'm a Hanzo main)
The man bow (I'm a Hanzo main)

 Welcome
Enter my house and see my balcony
You're bound to be astounded deeply
That there's not another house in town as sweet
I bought my own land; built it with my own hands
It's like Chopin's piano, man, it's so grand
Whether you're a lady or a hood rat
Good, bad
You won't resist me after witnessing my mudcrab
I'll run a bubble bath with enchanted suds
Have you pulling me off like a poorly fitted hubcap
I need the green to build my dream house
So I can grow my peas and beans and other greens in the greenhouse
Give me the keys, I'm keeping bees in the garden
Beat a skeever up, then bust a free with my bard
And I'm flossing in the trophy room
So don't go too soon
I still need to show you my minestrone soup
I baked some space cakes laced straight with Moon Sugar
Got a house, wife and two kids, but I'm no do-gooder
MTV Cribs; I'm still the Dragonborn
But now it's my cow that has the badass horns
It's getting late - I hope you understand
Look, Corrie's coming on in five
So get off my land
Milk drinker




 Sarah Kerrigan
Used to be the queen of blades but she has changed
Or maybe deep beneath the surface she's the same
As in the previous game
The Zerg have been and came, they yearn for these terrains
Observe the teaser trailer, deep relationships are complicated
EG: Sarah's thing with Raynor
See - she doesn't know what makes sense
She loves him as much as she hates Mengsk
But James has a sense that her craving for vengeance
Has sent her to take some great lengths
It'll take strength to face - so I suggest you defend your base
Cos if Sarah Kerrigan is never getting better then
The Terrans evidently better get together
And prepare a method of repelling her
I'm telling you, any and every hellion
Better be levelling and getting heavier
Nefarious, tell Valerian his dad's life expectancy
Is desperately precarious
And he'd better be aware of this
(Bridge x2):
Once you've been the killer queen
The Wings of Liberty are nothing
But a means to give your enemies some misery
(Hook x2):
Be warned in the heart of the swarm lies evil (The Heart of the Swarm)




 A storm is approaching
We'll call it a blizzard
To freeze the seas
And leave frozen all of the waters and rivers
War is a given
No hidden extras
Just endless offense and defense
To resolve the control of the Nexus

My actions are reckless
I'm trekking the map with a death wish
I'll do a little more than just snatching your necklace
I'll have you for breakfast
You're last on my checklist
Trapped in the Nexus
Gasping and breathless
Grasping for exits
But I pull you back to the cesspit
So you better pray that you're ready for the ride
To the place where dimensions collide

We're the heroes of the storm
We've been brought from Azeroth
To the Heart of the Swarm
We're the heroes of the storm
Transform to our final form
As we ride to the shores
Of the tides of war

Are you after an argument fella?
If you are, then I'll pardon your error
But you'd better leg it from the light of the sky temple
To the dark of the garden of terror
Dragon shire to Blackheart's bay
Cursed hollow, ain't that half cray?
And although your last fight lacked heart, hey
Have an invitation to the mad partay
It's going to get so surreal
Look above, there's Tyrael
Hanging in the sky like an aerial
Fending off hell and when he dies
Then he pops like generic non name brand cereal
Thrall is a warchief
Of the horde, he's
The sort of orcward guy
To saunter right through the haunted mines
He was born to survive
You were born to die

We're the heroes of the storm
We've been brought from Azeroth
To the Heart of the Swarm
We're the heroes of the storm
Transform to our final form
As we ride to the shores
Of the tides of war

I'll personally stamp on a mercenary camp
Observe me expanding the mercs in my ranks
Merking your carries and hurting your tanks
You hoped it was over, but Murky is back
Merking your carries and hurting your tanks
You hoped it was over, but Murky is back
Illidan'll kill a man a minute in a melee
Give the model man a medal
Man, he didn't dilly dally
Damn, a limber limb'll live a little longer
Than the liver of a little lost lamb
In the middle of an alley
And with her valour Valla's manner manages to banish you
To Valhalla
Well, hell, I'd had enough of valleys
Hey, better watch when you wander the lanes
Unless you want Sonya on you again
Jaina's a mage that engages and maims
You'll be left with lasagna for brains
The lane in Raynor's range is raining rage
So rein it in the rate of your rave
Or the raiders'll raise their rays
With a razor aim
And raze your race and reign
My raison d'etre's to get you and wreck you
'Til you're left shrivelled like a raisin, damn
You better pray that you're ready for a ride
To the place where dimensions collide

We're the heroes of the storm
We've been brought from Azeroth
To the Heart of the Swarm
We're the heroes of the storm
Transform to our final form
As we ride to the shores
Of the tides of war




 This is for Chelsea Manning
This is for Edward Snowden
This is for all the Whistleblowers who we'll never know
And this is for Anonymous
This is for Avaaz
The following lyrics are going to be particularly
HAAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAR-shh

How long before they're storing all of it?
They know my lyrics before I've recorded them
Shit's getting more and more Orwellian
How long before they hoard everything?
They know my Facebook wall messages
They can read my e-mails and it's all effortless
They know my porn preferences and dwarf fetishes
But they don't know what the difference between laws and ethics is
But know we've all found out what the F it is
We'd better give them a lesson in etiquette
You wanna heckle the Bolivian President?
You better give me some evidence
It'd be evident if you were meddling
In another government up in this web we're in
So I'm sending this to the President
You're setting a sickening precedent
Said I'm sending this to the President
You're setting a sickening precedent
Oh now that I've written a threatening letter
This kid is a dissident rebel
We better get him on the list of significant threats
With the rest of America
If you love your country, your country should love you too
But how can you trust someone who doesn't trust you?
Prism is a prison and the prisoner's your mind
Pulling out their pecker and they're pissing on your rights
So let's take a leaf out of their hands
And take a leak every opportunity we can
If you love your country, your country should love you too
But how can you trust someone who doesn't trust you?
I'm watching you, watching me
We're a drama scene
But the chemistry's not there
There's no Bonhomie
Mr. Obama needs to heed the words of Romney
Cause he's got binders full of everyone
It's morally fucked

The clock strikes thirteen on the dot
Another Whistleblower finds a little glowing spot
Right between his eyes in the middle of his forehead
For revealing lies his prize
Is that he falls dead
I'm watching you, watching me
Watching you, watching me
And between us there's a lot to see
We'd probably rather not have leaked
I'm watching you, watching me
Wondering to what degree
Your intercepts infringe my intellectual property

The clock strikes thirteen on the dot
Another Whistleblower finds a little glowing spot
Between his eyes in the middle of his forehead
For revealing lies his prize
Is that he falls dead

Someone at the National Security Agency
Could blatantly be paid a fee
Create a breach to basically mean any shady people
Are safe and free to take a peek
Look I don't believe in evil
But I believe in greed or paranoia
Power hungry, that's abusive
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
And I'll hammer that home 'til they have to shoot me
I'd be happy to head down the bookies
And bet that they're getting a good look at my cookies
They're up all night to get cookies
They're up all night to get cookies
They're up all night to get cookies
They're up all night to get cookies
And who took the cookies out the cookie jar
If you can't see that, then you aren't looking far

The clock strikes thirteen on the dot
Another Whistleblower finds a little glowing spot
Between his eyes in the middle of his forehead
For revealing lies his prize
Is that he falls dead
When the NSA watches everything we say
We've got to make sure we say what we really need to say
So hey there NSA
How are you today?




 (slapping on thighs)

My thighs hurt
I will stop slapping them now
I need to find another part of my body to, to slap
In order to continue the momentum of the song
How about
How about my, my, my booty?
How about I turn around and slap my booty?
(slapping)
Ooh, it's so much more percussive!

 Hitch

Does religion bring savagery or humanity?
He made a canny case, whatever your mentality
Not a fan of Islam or Christianity
He favoured Thomas Paine and Galileo Galilei
A beacon, a bastion of sanity
Rare these days, in the age where we have to be careful
What we say, for fear of profanity tearing
The veneer of inanity we passively wear (yeah)
He gave prophets of sophistry a panicky air
And that's blasphemy, it has to be, how could he dare?
He weaved a very literary tapestry
Airing his opinion in the New Statesman, Vanity Fair (yeah)
But now he's left the land of malady
Where his health deteriorated rapidly
Prayer from the faithful, failed to do jack
As his hair fell away the same way his foes' fallacy fared
See, he proffered a reality
Where illogicality and God's irrationality
Barely needed to be scrutinised as anything but stupid lies
And he managed it with valor, wit and gallantry, generally, though
Not a man for geniality, evidently
And though he's dead, his immortality's there
In every interview and article, he left behind a particle
Of the soul he never believed he had, and that's remarkable

Hitch, uh, uh
Atheism
Haha

 I am nobody
I am everybody
Heaven forbid that any killer could be better than me
You'll never see me
I'm chameleon
Premium
I could be bohemian or deviant
Or dressed up as a chef experimenting with deadly ingredients
My rope'll tighten up your vocal cords like breathing helium
I am not evil, I'm relieving you from tedium
With anesthesia that's really rather lethal than convenient
Keenly clinical
Cold, clean
He isn't a criminal
He's cleaning up the whole scene
Keep it minimal
Turn believers cynical
Certain that i will achieve my goal, reach the pinnacle
Be it difficult, formidable or physical
Every killing's critical
To a level that's spiritual
I stay subliminal
May as well be invisible
Never leave a shred of evidence, I'm not empirical

I am nobody
I am everybody
Don't remember when there was someone who ever loved me
I am nobody
Yet there's forty seven of me
Blend in like a true clone
End them and collect the money
X2

I have no relatives
Collateral or leverage to pressure with
So you'll never give a hemorrhage
My only blood ties round my neck with elegance
I'm educated in the etiquette of decadence
Any chemical elements are potentially venomous
Even adrenaline has benefits
And when it hits
I can taste the blood of Christ in the sacrifice
He made through the sacrament
To save us in the afterlife
Every soul is sacred so no one has to die
I just changed the pace of the roll when I cast the die
Fate, hear the pastor cry
You may be a mastermind
But if you're my prey then there's no chance you'll last the night

I am nobody
I am everybody
Don't remember when there was someone who ever loved me
I am nobody
Yet there's forty seven of me
Blend in like a true clone
End them and collect the money
X2




 Alright, Lads
I'm one of the only people who have heard Edward Kenway rap
And live to tell the tale
And now
I'm going to tell you exactly what he said
He said:

These aren't the high seas
They're my seas
It's likely you'll find me inciting some maritime crises
Plunder all the prizes
From the skies to under water
Thunderballing, then I'm back aboard in time for my tea
Tides are dicey
You're dicing with death
Like a diver fighting
To rise for a breath
I'm a tycoon
Taking lives like a typhoon
Hypothesising that you're probably dying quite soon
But at least in the meantime
You can enjoy listening to my tune
It's an assassin sea shanty
So pass the neat brandy
And raise a glass to my sea-faring vigilantes

RIGHT, LADS
PACK YOUR BAGS
AND COME ABOARD
AS WE HOIST THE BLACK FLAG
I SAID
RIGHT, LADS
PACK YOUR BAGS
AND COME ABOARD
AS WE HOIST THE BLACK FLAG

Look
I'm a canny one
Scourge of the Seven Seas
Sink anyone's galleon
To murder my enemies
Whether he's been stabbed in a back street
Or a vast sea attack by the Black Flag fleet
Kicking people in the ribs
I leap from ship to ship
And clean the deck of crew as if I'm sweeping
Never miss a bit
No need for cruise missiles
I wield dual pistols
And rule this world from Kingston to Bristol
So you better make headway
For Edward Kenway
Or I'll hit you hard enough to send you to next Wednesday
I make the hardest seafaring men say:
"Get away from this fellow if you treasure your gems"
They say that he ranks amongst the most clever
Of the gentleman adventurers
Without measure
He spends half his time looking for exotic treasure
And the other half lusting for erotic pleasure


From England
To Kingston
To New Holland
He's a looting
Shooting

 Ah, greetings, you're right on time
Wipe your feet, you're invited inside
Your arrival is quite a surprise
You're ripe for the ride of your life
Right
Let me take your coat, you're welcome
Have a browse through the photo album
It's only seldom we host any guests
The rest of the family are home, I'll tell them
Come and join us for vittles
It'll satiate those cravings a little
Put some meat on those brittle bones
We insist, you must have a nibble
It's something we hunted, one for the road
Here's a clue: it's right under your nose
If you refuse, you'll be stunting the growth
Of your welcome to our humble abode
Those lonely country roads are so remote that no one'll know
You're overdue home, there's no bloody phone
Now go to your room or I'll go for your throat
When you're under my roof, you'll heed my rules
Succumb to my truth, do I need my tools?
Should I fetch my pliers? Should I come for your tooth?
It's your fault, I don't want to remove it

Home
Home is where the hate is
Home
Your relatives are waiting
Home
Everyone's related
Home
They who immigrate or natives
Home
Look what we've created
Satanist, sadist
Home is where the hate is

Butcher, baker, candlestick maker
You can't get away from your animal nature
Try as you might and the anger will take you
Now sample the cake that grandmother's made you
That's a family favorite, passed through generations of Bakers inhabiting the plantation
Eraserhead X Fantasia
It's fun and games, son, let Dad chase you
Here I come, ready or not
I hear a gun, bloody belly all shot
Don't you try to pee on my fun
We've barely begun and there's many more shocks in store for you
But you know that already
Of course you do, keep both hands steady
Adrenaline, what a hell of a drug
I'm getting a buzz from killing and peeling the skin of a corpse
I'm yearning for more
It isn't enough 'cause I've seen it before
I've been in a war within in my thoughts
The insects are wriggling from under the floor
You're injured, your innards are spilling
There's chunder and gore and blood on the walls
It's pungent and raw
That's the warm welcome I give out for someone who comes through my door
And into my

Home
Home is where the hate is

Your relatives are waiting

 Hi kids, do you like violence?
Seeing people dying to the cries of the sirens?
Leaving the crime scene nothing like you arrived
Full of bile, blood and another bunch of satisfied clients?
Well then you dialed the right hotline
Miami has a lot of numbers and of all of them you got mine
My top advice is not to get bothered with plot line
Just call us up and then I'll see if I can drop by
It all started with a call to East Seventh Street
I was blessed with a request that didn't need any pleasantries
There's no intense a feeling as dealing senseless beatings
To people who you previously wouldn't ever meet
Talk about being dead on your feet
The second that I enter people seem to end in a heap
I guess they can't deal well with the American heat
That makes you sweat red and then puts you forever to sleep
I guess I'm one heck of an interior decorator
Interfere with investigators, escalate a petty situation into mayhem
Exit stage left and step on the accelerator
The rest is even better, but I'd better tell you later
Because I've got another message and it won't wait
Someone needs me to clean their mess up in my own way
No fidgeting or messing and there's no delay
Fifty blessings later hit the motorway and rode away

There's one new message on your answer machine, it says:
How long d'you reckon that your hands'll be clean, it says:
It's dirty work, but someone's got to do the job
To go beserk and roll in the filth with the mob

Under neon lights
One phone call will decide who lives or dies
'Cause greed turns into pain and no one can escape
The crimson rain that pours over my soul
On these hot Miami nights
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
These hot Miami nights
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause greed turns into pain and no one can escape
The crimson rain that pours over my soul
On these hot Miami nights

Strip lights flicker as I sip my liquor
This life's sick and you can get by quicker
If you live like a sinner with your finger by the trigger
Or the throat of a foe, so it's goodbye, Richter
Wherever I go I seem to stand alone
Whether I head to the pizza shack or hang at home
Answer to no one but the answer phone, man, I love that hang up tone
More than a saxophone solo and a bag of blow
I'm holding a bat and donning an animal mask
So you can probably tell I've had a problematical past
But these aren't irrational acts, I'm enacting the task
That I've been handed by the man requiring absolute tact
And as a matter of fact, I'm really flattered he asked me
Because I'm a one man catastrophe factory
Think the Mafia's bad? You must be having a laugh, see
The man behind each massive massacre? That's me

There's one new message on your answer machine, it says:
How long d'you reckon that your hands'll be clean, it says:
It's dirty work, but someone's got to do the job
To go beserk and roll in the filth with the mob

Under neon lights
One phone call will decide who lives or dies
'Cause greed turns into pain and no one can escape
The crimson rain that pours over my soul
On these hot Miami nights
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
These hot Miami nights
Wo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause greed turns into pain and no one can escape
The crimson rain that pours over my soul
On these hot Miami nights




 Hello, it's Dan Bull, and one of the common things
I get sent most from the folks that are commenting
Is how did I turn my passion and obsession
For music, games and videos into a profession?
So I reckoned that I'd give a little lesson
So you get an impression of my method for success in this
My little niche, my particular field
And how I found people to whom it'd appeal
So let's rewind the clocks
Right back to when I was a skinny guy with spots
Didn't like school much, used to find it tough
So I'd sit at home alone and write a lot
Animating videos, making silly tracks
About ridiculous things I didn't really grasp
But it was all practice, it was all training
For the day that I prayed that I'd make it
Made a band with my mates called Matronsapron
Trained my brain to say I was fated for fame
In the holidays I got a taste of what I chased
So when I got to college age, I selected every topic based
On levelling up the skills that I needed
And I wouldn't give up until I'd succeeded
But unfortunately for me
I didn't see the futility of a media degree
In this game, qualifications are null and void
I rage quit, dropped out, became unemployed
But I learnt more surfing on the internet
Than I ever did at Leeds Met, no disrespect
Shared tunes on UKHHF
The feedback was brutal, I trained, got better
Didn't waste days trying to pray for forgiveness
I stayed up late 'til I made better mixes
'Til I had enough tracks for an album
The last of my cash, manufacture, then sell them
I sent demos to labels and DJs
Amazed that my MySpace attained maybe three plays
Came across a new site that did video
Didn't realise just how big it'd be though
Stuck a couple of tracks on just to see what happened
The next viral sensation? Me rapping!
Little me just sat in my bedroom
It gave me such an ego boost, I ran out of head room
I finally saw it could be more than just a dream
I felt a little more like Master P than Mister Bean
I tackled the task, making track after track
And uploading them to YouTube, back to back
Promoting them to you through tactics that
I'd planned out like a commander with tacks and a map
I made a log and made a lot of contacts
Journalists, bloggers, some of them even got back
We'll never catch prey if we wait for them to chase us
I got on television, radio and papers
And even though I didn't need TV
I bagged myself a meeting at the BBC
Now I was getting paid just to do my hobby
Plus Claudia Winkleman held the door and let me through the lobby
Rock and Roll, I finally got off the dole
No longer got the cold feeling that I'd lost control
'Cause I was finally driving at my own pace
Moved out the family home and got my own place
Like I could roam waves upon a chartered ship
Then I applied to YouTube for a partnership
Turns out that was brilliant timing
I made a little ditty for an Indie called Skyrim
All of a sudden like a million minds, listening
Hearing my rhymes, this was really unlike anything
I'd ever seen, ever heard, even ever knew
All of a sudden I could accrue revenue
Then it grew, head sweating, I was mopping off the residue
Doing better than my music teacher thought I'd ever do
Because now I was in the game rap rap game
Never predicted just exactly how big that became
Though I have to say, it wasn't major label rapper fame
But I was sweet enough I didn't need the Aspartame
I made new friends, made new fans
Linked the videos I made to some gaming brands
Then the next thing I knew, my plane had landed
In LA and we were making some major plans
I got to go to E3 and be in ERB
See the sea from the ceiling of my B&B
I couldn't even believe how far I'd come from home
Five thousand miles out my comfort zone
And I'd done it alone, myself, training talent
Through my many days basement dwellin'
The only real trick is maintaining the balance
Grabbing the stick instead of chasing the carrots
It takes dedication reshaping your habits
And never being afraid to be failed and embarrassed
I've made some mistakes that have damaged
My reputation, but I faced them and managed
The wild web as a place can be savage
So try and stay safe and just play the advantage
Stay on track of the skills in which you need to be proficient
Just doing what you've always done before is insufficient
The speed of the world keeps being increasingly efficient
So you need to keep your skill tree in peak condition
Now when I started out there wasn't so much competition
But neither did I have the tools to help me on my mission
Nowadays there's a thousand ways to do it our way
Way more avenues than hours in a day
So it's down to you how you're gonna train
Tune up in the garage, get the power in your brain
Choose your character, professional or amateur
Selecting all the attributes and stretching your parameters
Forget the panic and concern, step into the Animus
And you will be flabbergasted at the things that can occur
Whether you're a janitor, manager or grandmother
You can be interplanetary, travelling from planet Earth
So let's rewind the clocks
Right back to the time you were a tiny dot
Full of potential to become an eventual adventurer
That'll maximize all the time you've got
Start now




 Who should be the leader, who should be in control?
Is it Venus, Serena? Liam or Noel?
Hmm, Dave and Edward, man, who to choose?
It's like picking between Jake and Elwood Blues
To me, to you, the leader, who should it be?
I haven't got a clue so let's see:
Being sons of a Marxist Jewish refugee
Left a mark to ensure they would be MPs
State educated, dedicated to their destiny
Craved a piece of the cake but needed the recipe
Each gained a place at Balliol college
Studied PPE and attained all the knowledge
That they need, eg. how to shake all the wallets
Of their patrons and make them pay for their political promises
David Claydon, Sainsbury and a whole great heap of lobbyists
It's ominous

Here's some help if you can't understand
How to pick between Milibands
Here's some help if you can't understand
How to pick between Milibands

Now we've seen the similarities between the Milibands
So we should really have a little gander at disparities
Dave could have been a model in a magazine
While Edward resembles a model made of plasticine
David's New Labour: centrist sensibilities
While Edward entertains more leftist connectivity
But more importantly, Ed supports Leeds
While Arsenal are David's favourite football team
It's a shame that waving a banana
Creates such a major public relations disaster
But hey, didn't New Labour embark
On this image-centric situation to start with?
Plus there's other candidates that are clamouring to be grand champion
So let's take a second to step off the Milibandwagon
Also standing we have Diane Abbott
The female's favourite; Labour's Rampant Rabbit
Other candidates include Andy Burnham
Who's some random that I haven't really heard of
And then there's Ed Balls, a slightly slimy bloke
Who should form a comedy duo with Michael Gove
But their odds of winning are longer than the prose
In Tony Blair's new book, and equally as overblown
Gordon's overthrown so who'll go for the throne?
Will it be Kylie Miliband or Danni Mili Minogue?

Here's some help if you can't understand
How to pick between Milibands
Here's some help if you can't understand
How to pick between Milibands
Here's some help if you can't understand
How to pick between Milibands
Here's some help if you can't understand
How to pick between Milibands




 Oi (huh?)
Do you want to reduce climate change? (uh-huh!)
Then get off your botty and see
How many things you can do in one minute to help the environment

First attack plan, turning back the thermostat
And have a power shower, not an hour in the dirty bath
And when you're done, remember that you need to turn the tap off
And for that, you deserve a snack
But choose your food before you open the hatch
I've chosen a burger 
Clean your fridge 'til it's completely ice-free
And keep the heat of it slightly beneath five degrees
Buy things in bulk in multi packs, forget electric ovens
Cook with gas, drink right from the tap
Recycle a glass and buy environmental bags
Use rechargeables and plug your charger from the wall
And flick light switches off before you're charging through the door
Stretch your thighs, exercise
Collect some nice tangy green apples from your family tree
Eat organically, start a compost heap for planting seeds
And when the weather's nice, dry your pants naturally

One minute to save the world
One minute to save the world

Check your tires, share your car, don't use a hose
But a bucket and some vinegar
Donate your clothes, make your own
Take a moment to check the verge
And pick up stuff you find next to the curb
Then get on your bicycle and spread the word
Protect the earth
Protect the earth




 Piano and strings
Huh, a little bit cliché, but works well
Classic
Serious
Let's talk about something serious
This is important
Now let's do some rapping
Look

Fr-Fr-Fr-Fr-Fr-Fr
From Brother Ali to Forest Whitaker
When it comes to body image
There's a common myth that we're not bothered with it
But it's bollocks
It'd take a lot of confidence
To stop us wishing at least something was different
You see kids stacked with six packs
Skins tanned and big abs
And think that to fit in then you need to have this crap
I've had enough of airbrushed buff people I see on telly
Where's all the freckles, crooked yellow teeth and beer bellies?
I'm a bit chubby round the edges
Prefer pudding to veggies
In restaurants they say "do you want a side of salad or potato wedges?"
I'll leave you to guess my preference
*Insert generic Mr Creosote reference*
But I look after myself
Might grab an apple and leave the snacks on the shelf
As well as pizza I eat pasta as well
The human appendix is similar to my gym membership
It rarely ever gets used even when I remember it
Now I'm no exercise freak
But I exercise each week
Even if it's just stepping outside and down the street
I can swim, I can dance, I can skank or ride a bike
It doesn't matter man, variety's the spice of life
 (x2)
Why are you looking at me?
Stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and free
Why are you looking at me?
Man, stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and me

I thought "please Lord, make me thin"
"Paint my pasty skin"
"Take me out of this funny frame you've placed me in"
My face is ginger while my head hair is mousey brown
But I turned my doubts around
My thoughts are more healthy now
I quit searching for the perfect physique
I'd prefer to be a person that people feel at ease with when first we meet
See, it's not just about how you look when you're out with your friends
It's about whether you are looking out for your friends
 (x2)
Why are you looking at me?
Stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and free
Why are you looking at me?
Man, stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and me

I'm no Michaelangelo's David
My stature isn't classical
Sod a perfect body
Mine's autobiographical
Every flaw, every blemish, every scar
Is a natural tattooed testament to how I got this far
Cosmetics and excrement, I can't detect the difference
Except that the expensive one is what you want to get for Christmas
My head's significantly bigger than average
You'll laugh when you see me getting a hat fitted
It's the massivest
But that's the thing, it's a trivial matter
Except when acceptance happens to be the thing that you're after
Call me an ignorant rapper, spitting the dumbest rhymes
But you can stick your opinion where the sun doesn't shine
And for a chap my bum's more like Nicki's than Miley's
What a kick in the hiney
But so what? My friends think of me highly
Despite my glitches, they think that I'm the nicest guy
We like a bit of variety
It's the spice of life
 (x2)
Why are you looking at me?
Stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and free
Why are you looking at me?
Man, stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and me




 Hugh let the dogs out
Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh
Hugh let the dogs out
Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh

I believe Hugh Grant's gonna need new pants
'Cause his manhood's just been renewed
Wangling his way to a sweet news angle
You probably won't see on these news channels
News International's view's incompatible
With that of all of you who value truth over capital
Now I'm not saying Rupert's an animal
Hey, perhaps as a human he's affable
But Fair & Balanced, dude, that is laughable
Even calling it news is irrational
See, to them I'd be viewed as a radical
And for that, I ought to be stewed in a casserole
Pappers and tappers are just a new sort of cannibal
Using other people as food for their bankroll
So the fact that Hugh's done it back
Is amusing to me to the maxicles

Hugh let the dogs out
Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh
Hugh let the dogs out
Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh

Murdoch is nothing if he can't tap a phone
Murdoch will tap your phone
Murdoch will allegedly tap your phone
Murdoch is nothing if he can't tap a phone
Hugh, mate
I wanna buy you a drink
I'll even pay off the  you forgot the other day
Lolz




 Inquisitor

Ah, hallo, Sire. Shall we travel to the Fallow Mire?
These hallowed grounds face a threat that's hella dire
And I'm telling buyers beware of where you buy your wares
Check their origin like I did when I bought BioWare's
In the Arbor Wilds I hear there's a Fade Rift
And we need to rescue Farmer Giles somewhere near Redcliffe
We're almost at the Storm Coast, Val Royeaux's no more close
I sleep in a tent depending on events otherwise I'm in a bed with four posts
I suppose I had better be fetching my coat
Cause there's some Red Templars in the Western Approach
Oh! The Breach leaves the sky cold up in Skyhold
But I can afford to heat it, see this huge pile of my gold
No influenza, with these treaties I'm an influencer
Think you can beat me? Name a date and place, where and when, sir?
Should I spit ten bars or pages? Support Templars or Mages?
Collect Shards or guess star constellations and arrangements?
Seal rifts shut in Thedas, kick butt and save ass
With great gallantry, level up and upgrade my talent tree
Cause it ain't just hard in Hightown, like a tale that Varric weaves
There's an ancient massive effect, I may as well just save the galaxy

I am the Inquisitor, a Fade visitor
Zipping up the rifts with a fist is my signature finisher
My team administers me with the means to win imminently
And I may say that they do it magnificently
Once more unto the Breach, dear friends
Once more! Because Corypheus wants war
Once more unto the Breach, dear friends
Once more! We'll see if Corypheus wants more

We'll see if Corypheus wants more
Or whether he's had enough
He's a bit tired
And now he just wants to go home for tea

I've got the dopest team in Leliana
Josephine, Cullen, Cassandra
Solas, Sera, Blackwall, Dorian
Cole, Vivienne, Varric, Bull, Morrigan
Call us the D A Team: the Dannish Inquisition
Vacancies, apply within if you think you can fill this grand position
Corypheus has delusions of grandeur
A ridiculous man pursuing the Anchor
But hang on, you can pray and thank the maker in the Chantry later
Wait 'til Dan obliterates that manky mangy agitator
Blast this antagonist as if he's had a Dragon's Kiss
Leave him hanging there and haggard like a pair of sagging tits
In comparison I'm an ample and elegant breast
Not an Iron Bull but I am Bull nevertheless, yes!
Yes blud, I'm the Tim Westwood of Crestwood
The Method Man of the Hinterlands, Haven was the best hood
But my terrain ranges from Exalted Plains to Emerald Graves
When I stray there's no limit to who and where I will save
Between Ferelden and Orlais, I seem to be helping them all day
These Orlesians' decor schemes are really well bloody ornate
I've heard the myths but this is divine living
Like when I'm giving a wyvern a whiff of the rhythm
I witness how quick it'll give in
Give them a kick in the face from the Forbidden Oasis
To the Hissing Wastes to paraphrase Sera: This is a pissing disgrace
Damn son, I've had it with Samson
I'm going to get ever so terribly nasty
That's what happens whenever you mess with the Herald of Andraste

I am the Inquisitor, a Fade visitor
Zipping up the rifts with a fist is my signature finisher
My team administers me with the means to win imminently
And I may say that they do it magnificently
Once more unto the Breach, dear friends
Once more! Because Corypheus wants war
Once more unto the Breach, dear friends
Once more! We'll see if Corypheus wants more

We'll see if he wants more... once more
Once more...




 Hello Ian, how the hell have you been?
It's me again, your favorite rapping European
I'm here to leave you burnt like black toast
Welcome to the first ever episode of Rap Roasts
Ian, the type of content you make's that gross
You're just milk intolerance, lactose
Now, for anyone who's unfamilliar with your channel watching
You do a really funny series called "Bad Unboxing"
So I brought a box full of props of raps I'm dropping
And after that you could use it as your actual coffin
You already know smoking's bad for your health
So you must really crave having two fags in you mouth
Time to destress
Stop and take a deep breath
Not because you need air, fuck, I just want to hear you speak less
You look a reet mess
Woody Allen meets meth
Your ideal orgy's a sausage meat fest
You're so scrawny and you've got such a meek chest
That you still wear your age 0-3 vest
Invisible eyebrows on fleek, yes
With specs that thick you're never going to see chef
Of all the Ians in the world you're the least best
You're a bad driver, you deserve to have your jeep wrecked
You frail cracker, I could snap you like a crackerjack
And by the way, the past wants its glasses back
I'm a bit funny looking, check the size of my head
It still got nothing on your giant surprise egg
I'd lie to break it open, that'd be delightful
You look like a scrotum rolled over a lightbulb
When you were born your mum thought she'd either done a turd or given birth to a puppet out of thunderbirds
Say something
I'll take your fake diamond play button
And give you a face fucking
So you can taste sucking
You lame shut in
Get out and get some sunlight
Training for a fight's quite effective if it's done right
But you don't want to get into the ring with Jinx
You do want to get into Jinx's ring, methinks
Ugh, sitting in your room topping up your cummy sock
Then sucking out every fluffy crusty yummy drop
Like a hungry Winnie The Pooh tonguing a honey pot
And when you catch a cold, you bukkake runny snot
Bouncing up and down on your thumb like a bunny hop
Shouting "Mommy watch! You're gonna miss the m-m- money shot"
Sonny, stop before your briefs get a heavy leak
The human rectum shouldn't stretch more than ten inch deep
Remember when we went to Venice Beach?
You kept walking 'round talking with insensitive offensive speech
'Till you annoyed a fella with Floyd Mayweather's physique
And he did to you what Drake did to Meek
Ooh, Drama Alert, someone contact Keemstar
You're not a real cop Ian, where's your police car?
Rearrange the letters in Content Cop
And see that it's an anagram of concept, not
Kickstarter crap, crap skater trick, prick attack
Err, crack raper tits
Okay, even when I say that I'm cleverer than iDubbbz
More popular too, here, have some of my subs
You're just like me, were both acting like thugs
But are prone to panic attacks in nightclubs
Yo, the only time that you would fire slugs
Was if your zoo was overstaffed and you don't like bugs
Museums are the only time of you seeing nice jugs
And your dealer needs to see prescriptions when you buy drugs
And now it's crunch time for the final punchline
I can't come up with one so just like and subscribe
Cringe
I'm just playing, iDubbbz, you know I love you




 My name's Daniel, I'm 28 and I'm a self harmer
What I'm telling you is real, not just another way to sell drama
Not doing this for karma, tearing, throwing off my armour
There, I'm showing off my scars, I'm bare, I hope I've not alarmed you
The way I retaliate to aggravation and stress is to smack myself in the face 'till my sad face is a mess
Scream my fucking lungs out, Gasp, taking a breath
Hit the right pitch, the sound of glass breaking is bliss
But I can't smash the mirror, I'm afraid of broken glass
So I punch the face I see in it, my bones make an open gash
I need a healing potion fast, throw me in the ocean, splash
The lifeboat has capsized, we've no hope
And no man's an island, my contraband is anger, violence
Lower the flag, no aggro, please, I demand silence
Skull and crossbones, swollen cheekbones
Pull the trigger, reload
Pull the trigger, reload
See me overdose on friendly fire
No hope 'till I tote a broken nose and I can then retire

Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do

I feel ashamed of what I did now I've returned to clarity
Even though I only hit myself, still it hurt my family
All the things I hate about myself, they may be true or not
It doesn't matter when my face is battered blue and black with bruises
Don't know what abuse is, why I do this, I'm a loser, a faggot four eyed freckle faced fucking waste of space, I've had it
I deserve to be damaged, it's a hurt I can manage
I can take physical pain, it's the words that are savage
My nerves are just ravaged, a small disturbance is all but certain to cause turbulence and of course they urge me to panic
I'm scared of blood but never backed down from a brawl
Stand up for myself, never sat down on the wall
I'll go toe to toe until I'm passed out on the floor
One of us is going to hospital, that's how much I'm raw

Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do




 Hey ho!
Let me take over and amaze those couch potatoes
As I slay foes who stray close to my caseload of great flows
Every moment I make goes straight to the Summoner showcase
Most played so they know me as the Great Bull
You're a scapegoat
Your opinion's nothing to me
I'm running Dominion
Buffing my speed
And some of the Summoners coming at me
Are just gonna be meat to increase my sum of xp
I'm brilliant killing a million minions a minute until
I've diminished your kingdom
You're finished
You're fish fillets
Your tower is under attack
I'm the Tienanmen square man
You're vanishing under my tank
My champions dismantling your Pantheon and ganking them
He's leaving them bleeding and needing immediate
Treatment from an ambulance
And when it comes to spells
I'm betting you can't even spell "Chrysanthemums"

I lead the League of Legends
You idiots need protection
My collection increases weekly
'Til I reach perfection
(2x)

I fire fireballs
At the Riot Store
Champions? I try 'em all
And level them up into higher forms
'Til my enemies look at the eye of the storm
I'm taking aim and raining pain again again you're slain
To explain my brain's a strain
But it's safe to say I remain insane
I lay in wait beneath the shrubberies and jungle leaves
Coming from the trees to plunder everything but your dungarees
My hunger needs feeding
I feast on feeble underlings
And leave them wondering whether it's thunder or my tummy rumbling
And now I'm within your perimeter
Administering your distributor
With a particularly vicious and pitiless kick in the
Knickers until it gives in to testicular sickness
My method's meticulous
This record's ridiculous
I'm a carnivorous sinister villainous killer
You're just a little wuss


I'm brutal
I lack scruples
So any defence is actually futile
I'll never attend a tribunal
'Til everything ends and it's my funeral
I've got rooms full of Runes
It's not just hot tunes I produce
With lots of vitality clarity avarice malice alacrity
It's a laugh to see you after me and my masteries
What's that you trying to cast at me?
I'm cleansing anything men have attempted to send in my path you see?
These legendary staffs and blades
Will send a competitor back to base
My most regular WAV that's played?
An enemy has been slain




 I love (gasp)
Kanye




 I've fallen in love with someone unexpected
Spend all of my money on her
Until there's nothing left
And at the end of the day she waits at the corner shop
And lets me pop to fetch her
I guess that it's a ritual now
I'm addicted to how she's got me breathless
Ever since that first cool kiss
It's bliss

I appear to be in love
With someone I never dreamed of

A lot of us have a soft spot for coffee
Well my one stop shop for pop is the offy
Knocking back bottles is my hobby, so what?
What the fuck would I want to be stopping for?
I lock my door, tip the bottle and pour
Finish off all the port, and still I'm wanting more
With a beer put beside me I come alive
I feel that my mind loosens up and thrives
And such delightful stuff that lights up my rubbish life
Is something quite tough to give up imbibing
There's nothing like it, drunken nights in a pub
Or drunken nights in with nine tins
If drinking was a drinking game, I'd win
Then wish to play best of five
Then best of the rest of the night
'til I'm a mess of a sight
But having an excellent time
For the rest of my life I swear

In the loneliest of nights
Yeah I'm alright
In the loneliest of times
I'm fine

Let me see, the bottom of a bottle is the lens
On which I've come to depend to let me see
I look at my friends that are ahead of me
I'm not going to pretend there's no jealousy
I was full of potential for fun and adventures
But somehow the fun's now come to an end, look:
Rewind back - as a lad I saw drunks
And thought that I would never be like that
Now I see people look at me like that
And it seems like we wind the thing right back
I see my past, see my path
And I see the spot where I wandered off life's beaten track
But even that won't sober me up, I'll go to the pub
And swallow my pride til I'm throwing it up
Is it the lowest I've sunk of all time?
I don't know, and I don't give a fuck, look, I'm fine




 When she showed me the pregnancy test I felt numb
I thought these things were supposed to tell the facts
Howcome we got this outcome?
They're meant to be ninety-nine point nine percent accurate
But now I doubt them
I thought maybe one day I may want a baby
But not here, not now, what, are you crazy?
It's too soon I'm too stupid to build a human nest
I'm a man child hiding in the shadow of my student debts
We always used protection, at least to my recollection
Well, i guess this is another new regret to my collection
And I won't kill a fetus
Even if it's milimetres
If I'm big enough to spill a seed, then i'm big enough to let it breathe
A fellow creature, full of genes with each of us
We're big enough to bring it up and let it develop features
Left speechless
But my ears hurt even when I hear tiny noises
How am I going to deal with each night of crying high-pitched voices?
When they're in pain there's no way to make them say it softly
I'm good with kids, as long as someone can take them off me
And what'll remain of our relationship that's already strained?
The love that's left it's drained and plumbed into a baby's veins
And what if this isn't the right relationship to stay with?
At this stage in the day it may just be to late to change it

I'm going to be a daddy and I'm fucking terrified
I'm gonna throw up and there's nowhere I can ever hide
I want to stop, I want to wake up and get off this ride
I'm going to be a daddy and I'm fucking terrified

My life is rather good, it's no time for fatherhood
Looking at the cats it's hard enoguh, I can't give up my livelihood
I can't be a role model, my own soul's swaddled
My train of thought's like a pram rolling on old cobbles
How can I change the habit of a lifetime?
I'm a lazy chappy
Change that?
I've never had to change a baby's nappy
Don't want to watch the Tweenies on the TV
I like cult classic black and white cinema, fuck CBeebies
I don't have a choice anymore
I don't have a voice anymore
Can't make noise anymore
I can't have a bottle of brandy and a LAN party with the boys anymore
The way I want to steer the ship and the way it heads is all different
The game of life is flipped from single player to a co-op escort mission
How can I provide enough safety and security?
When it feels like it's the whole world versus her and me?
Poland versus Germany
East versus West
Earth eating itself while I've invited you to be its guest
What can I bring to the table?
I'm not mentally stable
But they say parenting's innate and we're all meant to be able
But what if it's ill, what if it's disabled, what if it's not mine?
What if it dies, what if it grows up to be a horrible little gobshite?
What if it hates me? What if it's not just one kid?
What if it listens to this song and feels unwanted?

I'm going to be a daddy and I'm fucking terrified
I'm gonna throw up and there's nowhere i can ever hide
I want to stop, I want to wake up and get off this ride
I'm going to be a daddy and I'm fucking terrified

I hope I can be helpful during the birth
Providing backup for the mother of the youngest of the children of earth
When it's eighteen, I'll be forty-eight
When it's forty-eight, I'll be seventy-eight
And when it's seventy-eight, I should be dead in the grave
Or in my place waiting at the heavenly gate
Every day a memory fades except for some strange cases
Like when I'm travelling back to the past and wondering wether to change places
When she showed me the pregnancy test, I felt numb
But now I've settled down, I've got one message:
Welcome

I'm going to be a daddy
I'm going to be a daddy
I'm going to be a daddy
I'm going to be a daddy
I'm going to be a daddy
I'm going to be a daddy
I'm going to be a daddy
I'm going to be a daddy




 Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto

In my belly, there was nothing
So empty, I really needed a drink
Then you came in, with some tights on
And a skirt so short, I could see your minge
And you said: "Come to the
Pub with me, please
Let us binge
Thoroughly"

I'm not pissed
I can drink you under the table
I'm not pissed
I've smashed off my faiths
On your knees
In a  you see
I'm not pissed
Let me finish this glass, and we can get some shits
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto

When I'm walking at an angle
I'm not tipsy, I just love to lean
Laying down now, time for sleeping
But before that, where are my khakis?
I'm sure I 
The club with me, jeez
Everything's fuzzy
But

I'm not pissed
I can drive perfectly safe, look
I'm not pissed
Noone's on the road this late
On your knees, 
I'm not pissed
Now be a good lass and kiss my dick




 Where are my tightest clothes?
The ones that show off my muscles
The ones that make me look like
I could potentially have a six pack
If I, if I
Worked out a bit more
And ate less chips
I need to look the part
I need to feel the part
I need to play the part

It couldn't be clearer
The era
Where we knew which superheroes were who
And who to cheer and who to fear is in the rear view mirror
And a new one with new rules is nearer
Rewriting the rule book
I'm not following the lines that a fool put
Rivals are all shook
Awestruck
It's all good, my bruv
Get in line for a skullfuck
Guns unrequired, I fire with a full hook
With a force of a dump truck
You dumb fuck
Now, let me carry on recalling the story
Of how you chumps become unstuck
I open a leather bound tome
Gonna send the Netherrealm home
I'm not implying your mom's a Jezebel ho
But she does seem to get around though
Whoops
Oh, settle down, bro
If you're getting ever so upset about jokes
How the hell are you going to take a terrible blow
To the face when it breaks all your skeletal bones?
What's a skeletal bone? I don't even know
It just made an incredible flow
Turn it up, don't keep those decibels low
Make them bigger than the biggest NFL bloke
Hit you with six shots as kids watch
Sticking the clip up on World Star Hip Hop
Sod body bags, your body's bits got taken away to the tip in a Ziploc
And after the war, there's gore on the floor
That's really gonna have to get mopped
Now you know how I am when I'm pissed off
You understand why you shouldn't have kicked off

Injustice
Factions dissolve and fall
And lust for power enslaves us all
Injustice
Lines in the sand being redrawn
Perhaps it's time that we're reborn

Side scrolling, mind controlling
Don't roll in the roads I'm patrolling
If I see your eyes, then I might put a hole in them
Slicing you a nice new colon
I'm battering people I pass in the street
'Cause I'm catching the feeling they're laughing at me
Paranoid, man, I hope you're not attached to your teeth
Smashing your glasses to pieces
No more Clark Kent, no more Superman
What did you do to Dan?
I'm a dastardly beast, last of the pacifist geeks
But that was the past, now I'm back with a beef
Payback for the actions I've seen
That's satisfaction to me
Not every fact's what it seems
Re-read the captions and see
We have been rapt, in a dream
Lean back and bask in the beams
Of twilight gleaming from the sky
I remake my faction, my team
This time, it's political
This time, it is physical
This time, my lines here are literal
This time, figural violence is visceral
I'm in your peripheral vision
And a split second decision is critical
Like your condition, it's pitiful
Hope the hospital's hospitable
I'm a bitter ball of all the big and little brawls I've been in since I was small
And I'll continue kicking you 'til I'm against the wall
Or I don't exist at all


Right, get these clothes off me
It's not ergonomic
Help me get them off
Yes, it's squashing my balls
No wonder Batman's so miserable
'ing hell
Wearing that all day... sheesh




 Of all the gin joints
In all the towns
In all the world
In all the galaxies
You had to be
The one into which I've been hurled

In the distance one little man
Sits on the fringe of a wondrous expanse
Physics, math, leave nothing to chance
Binary beats make numbers dance
On a map as vast as our lack of understanding
Of even the spot you stand in
Avast, nail your map to the mast
Pieces of 8-bit data drift past
Digits and data drifting in space
Just sit and wait to be diligently saved
In the Atlas and graphed
And collated in ways
Not even N.A.S.A could track
Im Charles Darwin as he lands at the Galapagos
Encountering a thousand-pound
And winged Dog-billed Platypus

Explore, fight
Trade, survive
Explore, fight
Trade, survive (let's go)

In No Mans Sky
Climb in your seat
Close the window and fly
Rise up now
Go and find
Why life thrives
Look low and high
Leave behind a gleaming line
Of notes and signs
Keep your enemies close
See foes and fight
For your life
Until you're home and dry
Avert your eyes
From solar glowing lamp lights
Who knew paradise would be so damn bright? (bright, bright)

Iridescent
Opalescent
So pleasant
I'm getting a bit tumescent
Free fall, three, four
Kilometres to the floor
Wee, phwoar! Me, I'm enthralled
With all of the flora, fauna before me
I thought I'd fall on a flaw
Forced to the fore, fallen and forlorn
Forever more, what a terrible thought to be fought
Before terraforming, exploring
Forage through foreign forms
Forest, fawn, flower and thorn
I've found and filed a thousand kinds
And now I'll find a thousand more
I didn't forget them
They're hidden, fluorescent
Forbidden, effervescent
I'm getting a bit tumescent
If I am fortunate enough
To find a formula for all the stuff
The sky will fall from up above
I'm flying for the love
For the love
For the love, for the love
For the love
For the love, for the love (let's go now)

Explore, fight
Trade, survive
Explore, fight
Trade, survive

In No Mans Sky (yeah)
Climb in your seat
Close the window and fly
Rise up now
Go and find
Why life thrives
Look low and high
Leave behind a gleaming line
Of notes and signs
Keep your enemies close
See foes and fight
For your life
Until you're home and dry
Avert your eyes
From solar glowing lamp lights
Who knew paradise would be so damn bright?

For the love
For the love, for the love
For the love
For the love, for the love

Wherever we've been we leave pollution
We need a clean solution
No matter whatever you believe in, you should
See through to the conclusion
Human beings are being a nuisance
An abusive stream of evolution
Views that seem to disagree
Are surely leading you to ruin
Through and through
We need to do away with the delusion
That the universe is merely here for amusement
Hear the music, its a mutagen
To neuter men's illusion
Every creature's doomed
For use through what we do to them
Cease taking previous mistakes
And reproducing them
Lets clean the slate, wipe the canvas
And make the painting beautious again

In No Mans Sky
Climb in your seat
Close the window and fly
Rise up now
Go and find
Why life thrives
Look low and high
Leave behind a gleaming line
Of notes and signs
Keep your enemies close
See foes and fight
For your life
Until you're home and dry
Avert your eyes
From solar glowing lamp lights
Who knew paradise would be so damn bright?




 Hey! Hey!
Look, he’s InTheLittleWood, real name Martyn
A tough bugger so you better not be starting
‘Cause if you’re rucking with the King of the Saplings
You’re gonna be on the receiving end of my backswing
Who can take Tekkit and wreck it without effort
Simultaneously quoting the poems of Samuel Beckett
Man, I just made up a fact, but feck it
Sometimes I come up with rubbish because I loved the auditory aesthetics
I suggest you grab a potion and neck it
‘Cause there’s a new LittleWood video, get Chrome up and check it
Woah! The pyrotechnics of his Oculus’ biometrics
Are so sweet that they’ll probably make you diabetic

Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!

Is it a spelling mistake or something in my eye? No!
He really does spell Martyn with a ‘Y’, oh!
Holy moly he is globally known for being bros with SoTotallyToby
And although I know that evidence is purely anecdotal
We can hopefully overlook it and keep it low key
So why don’t we? Okie dokie!
Living in the Little Wood is more than a little good
Hairs on your chest is the sort of thing that it’ll put
So come and have a gander! Get in on the banter!
If you don’t, you’re an absolute… W-Wally?
And if you spy Martyn or Kaeyi
Don’t forget to politely say “Hai!”

Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!

Who’s that blondie pops? The one we watch
On our phones, our PC screens and on the box
He’s got the keys to the RPG scene
He might be a beauty but you’ll never see him sleeping
He doesn’t just focus on hot things like a welder
He takes us back to the classics: Zelda!
He’s old school he doesn’t be no newbie
Jollier than Oliver from Ni No Kuni
Aww what a cutie, he’s all 2D
But if need be he’ll kick your booty like Bruce Lee
Leave you with a bruised knee so you better sit down!
Soz I didn’t mean to shout; that was a bit loud

Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!

Who’m I rapping about? Who’m I rapping about?
Who’m I? Who’m I?
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!




 Computer games are getting too easy these days (WHY!)
For each mistake we just reload and resave
In the meek way that they were never meant to be played
We need to cease placing emphasis on seagate
Be brave, and implement a higher plan
Of gaming and never saving, the name is Iron Man

I want an adrenaline overload
Iron Man Mode (X2)
Never save gameplay, never reload
Iron Man Mode (X2)

If there is no risk, then there's no reward
Slaves to the save, throw your overlords overboard
Computer mutiny through the screens new to me
Dan and a cannon canning anyone that shoots at me
Napoleonic flows, Bonaparte, leaving loads of foes blown apart
No comeback, Kenobi Obi-Wan
For one life only Lonely Heart
No reloading, you can only restart
This is Iron Man Mode and I am Tony Stark (HA)


You'll realize real life is irreplaceable
No three strikes, this isn't baseball
Your bones are breakable, your foes'll break them all
They'll take the opportunity by any means available
To demonstrate that your remains are quite biodegradable
If you're incapable to comprehend mortality
I advocate the remedy of permanent fatality




 It's yours
Whose world is this?
: The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?

I sip on coffee, watching YouTube until I'm energised
And ready to untangle the web of lies my head is tied with
No time to be spineless, mindless
Do the mathematics of life, that shit's a minus
I got a stack on mind that happens to rhyme
And so I'm tapping and typing, tagging the times
I'm rapping beside it, manically amassing the massacred lines
Until I've massacred minds, that's a good time
I'd like to think I'd whoop your ass in a fight
But the fact is that I am probably lacking the iron
Lagging behind when it comes to having that in my diet
I'm nutritionally deficient, 
I need those microproteins like a dope fiend
And I need your advice like Pinocchio needs a nosebleed
I'm out for democratically elected MPs to represent me


To my man Will Smith, you're an inspiration
I'll look up to about 80% of all the things you say, sir
I love your work ethic
What do you do if you really really want something? Go get it
I've never heard an excuse that wasn't pathetic
That's unfulfillingly prophetic
There's not a worse method for not getting what you want in life
In the concrete jungle, my wallet is my hunting knife
I better go and buy my mommy something nice
I'm a DatPiff mythbuster, debunk your lies
Supplying logic to the disses that come my way
I'm a lion getting slept on tonight – Awimbawe
The things I say are exceptionally deep
I'm out for democratically elected MPs to represent me
I'm out for democratically elected MPs to represent me


I do a third verse, cos third verses are the status quo
And I've heard the status quo is the way to go
To make the paper flow, to make it rain the dough
Like the bakers just blew up, I was made to blow...up
Not willies, silly billy
I pray to Jean-Luc Picard to make it so
Taking over planets until I'm respected
The guiding principles of the prime directive, rhyme detective
I try to utilise the clues and use the lines that I'm the best with
Connect the puzzle pieces nicely and then wreck shit
Put the pieces back in the box and take it back to the charity shop
Hah, can he be stopped?
Well, yes I can, frankly
But my words will carry on, Anne Frank-ly
I'm used to hiding in the attic
I was acrophobic, then I learnt to use my love globally


To everybody in Bromsgrove, the world is yours
To everybody in England, the world is yours
To everybody in America, the world is yours
To everybody in Burundi, the world is yours
To everybody on Youtube, the world is yours
To everybody who likes...cats, the world is yours
To everybody who...who...picks their nose, the world is yours
Everybody does it, it's okay. Just be hygienic about it. It's a naturally function




 A long time ago in a galaxy far away
A battle between son and father raged
The dad represented an empire of hate
While the son's side brought light
To erase the dark away
What?! Feel the beat drop, like a rock
That an Ewok dropped from a treetop
You be lost like Luke on his Tauntaun
Man, he should have probably took a TomTom
It's getting Hoth in here
So put on all your clothes
Before you're froze
Cold as ice like my hardboiled prose
Hip hop C-3PO, fluent in six million flows
Oh no, I'm a rap Han Solo
Backpack Jedi Master YOLO
No fool, old school like Yoda
Fly in a Vauxhall Supernova
Souped up chunk of metal, son
Revving and ready for the Kessel Run
Hey matey! Your AT-AT's slower than AT&T
I could have ate tea at the age of eighty
And still evade Vader's late fleet
When I aim I can read your mind
Make your speeder bike and a tree colide
Ow, there's a leak in your trousers
I've got a bad feeling about this

May the Force be with you
May the Dark Lord forgive you
Anakin Skywalker, beat slamming
Like a car door, sir!
You're comic, I'm a Dark Horse
This is Star Wars!
X2

Between me and you there's business
Bigger than Lucas and Disney's
Like Luke I was born to do this
I've used the Force and torn
Through the stormtroopers
All you noobs are sore losers
You scruffy looking nerf herders
Motherfuckers deserve murder
I smash my rivals! Snatch the title
Look at my blaster rifle (PEW!)
Splat your eyeball!
Peep through the binoculars
See the future of oculus
I'm the Boba Fett of the net
But I've not got any offers yet
I'm not respected enough
Cos I go over your head like a hover jet
I got it in the pocket, you're a rookie
I rip your arm out the socket like a Wookie
Look here, I'm a new rapper
Half computer half Chewbacca
You're not that bad but you lack heart
Mon Calamari, tell them Admiral Ackbar
Set traps so you better get back
When I'm strapped with a jetpack necks snap
So get from the back to the front
Pick a faction and fuck shit up, Battlefront
So get from the back to the front
Pick a faction and fuck shit up, Battlefront

May the Force be with you
May the Dark Lord forgive you
Anakin Skywalker, beat slamming
Like a car door, sir!
You're comic, I'm a Dark Horse
This is Star Wars!
X2




 So much drama goin' in the LBC
It's kinda hard being Road H-O single G
It's bloody Roadhog
Ay, it's Chad and I'm really fat
It's bloody Roadhog
You know, I kind of look like Roadhog
Is this- is this why you asked me to be part of your Roadhog rap, Dan?

It's bloody Roadhog
That bloke what don't knock the door
Before he blows all your clothes off
So what?
Your number's up like he's scrolling through your phone log
You're just another Joe Bloggs
Learning that there's no God
Twisted Jehovah's witness
Sticking shit through your postbox
Hopping on the chopper
Rode off, you know he won't stop
For nothing but a robbery
A sloppy joe or blowjob
The saggy pantsed avalanche to your snowdrop
Flows hotter than a smoke shop stove top
Big belly flopping, stopping any deadly bowshot
He's his own boss
Road up to a roadblock
And told cops he's robbing them
So sorry for the hold up
Oh, fuuu...!
Rock and Roll, frog and toad
Hot and cold, lock and load
No one else gotten close, bruv
Heavy as a truck
Rigged up, fingerless gloves
Knuckle dusters and a thumb ring
Ready to ruck big
Going up against this bugger is a though gig
Feel the hooks dig
Bleeding like a stuck pig (whee!)
Grammatic anarchist
No fucks gived
Oh no, he didn't go there
He just did!
Now I'm gonna do the Roadhog thing again, okay you ready?

Just when you reckon this rap's run amok
I pull a Roadhog and drag you right back with the hook
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Stopping your life story
During the prologue
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Nothing but flows
No build up and no drop
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
You can go sod yourself
With your own knob

Down and dirty
Below the belt is how he fights
Gut busting
Belly button is the outie type
As if his belt size isn't an unhealthy sign
Why lose weight now?
Another day there'll still be time
He'll be fine
Filthy minded filthy swine
Guilty of crimes
Of the kill people kind
Messy pig, prime specimen
Try and get him in a bind
And you're like to find your life line lessening
Lying little swines
I've a life lesson, listen in
When life gives you lemons
Make a mess of 'em!
When you're contaminated with that much radiation
You'll have to gas mask your face up
To save your bacon (snort)
When people are face to face with a danger dealer
They could either make a meal of it
Or take a breather
Break a case of beer
Chase it with a plate of quesadilla
Taste the meat
Appreciate the flavour, bacon squealer (whee!)
An impatiant diva
Meets an Australian geezer
Then eats enough greasy stuff
To create a seizure
Blazing reefers
Then blaming the red eye on hay fever
Don't know if you're gonna use this, but it's fucking garbage
Be honest
Yeah I know, I didn't think that punch line was great either

Just when you reckon this rap's run amok
I pull a Roadhog and drag you right back with the hook
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Stopping your life story
During the prologue
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Nothing but flows
No build up and no drop
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
You can go sod yourself
With your own knob
Just when you reckon this rap's run amok
I pull a Roadhog and drag you right back with the hook
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Stopping your life story
During the prologue
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Nothing but flows
No build up and no drop
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
You can go sod yourself
With your own knob




 I hopped onto the net today
Saw a link to the trailer for GTA
So straight away I pressed play
In wait to be blown away
I saw a couple walk
Through the mist on the beach
The pink light blissfully sweet
You could instantly see
The emission of heat
The sand on your feet
And wind from the sea
Joggers run past on the promenade
Then the camera pans up long and hard
There's no mistakin' it
From the palms in the valley
We're in L.A
GTA: San Andreas
A familiar name to the badass players
But as beautiful as it is
It could use a couple of clips
Of gore galore
A smorgasbord of footage
Of Bloods and Crips
Popping some clips
That was one of the best things
Hey, is that Carlton
From The Fresh Prince?
Loads of peeps on the hard streets
But no sign of a car thief
My God, I hope I get to actually
Drive a wind turbine
Sweet!
I couldn't give a fuck for a crop duster
I want to hit a cop
With a knuckle duster
Don't psychoanalyze me
In real life, I'm quite nice, see?
I see Tai Chi and exterminators
Have replaced Hot Coffee like a percolator
Not rock climbing and a driving range
Let's see more signs of guys in pain
I want an overload of action shots
Those moments happen lots
And are why we play GTA
Everyday and simply cannot stop
Hahaha!
Grand Theft Auto V
Grand Theft Auto V
Oh, isn't it exciting?




 Once upon a time there was a working class hero
Who wanted to give power to the people so
He asked us to imagine a world of peace,love and truth
To give peace a chance,
Do you want to know a secret from me to you?
All you need is love so love me do
And whether the music was acoustic or rock and roll
He walked the long and winding road 'till he wore out his rubber sole
With his old brown shoe
He broke walls and bridges down
Made us come together
'Caused us all to twist and shout
He was the one to tell us what goes on
Number nine, number nine revolution

John
John
Le-le-le-le-le-le-le-lennon
John
Oh, john
Le-le-le-le-le-le-le-lennon

He was a paperback writer
As well as pen and verse
His best known publication was a spaniard in the works
And in his own right
He would write and write and write
Cause you should do whatever gets you through the night
Every man has a woman who loves him more than any other
But for this boy,who'd compare to john lennons mother?
She's a woman named yoko
She's something new
So hold on john, because she loves you
This is real love
No more cover versions
Their love was just like starting over,two virgins
He was happier then anybody'd ever seen
But the boys at abbey road,didn't want to let it be


He went to live in new york city,but he lived on borrowed time
Living life with the lines,he was shot by a jealous guy
With a revolver,but don't ask me why
Life's little more then: Hello, goodbye
My, what a souvenir from their visit to america
Now hes going to strawberry fields forever
Hardly instant karma, but
Calm your nerves
Cause this beautiful boy's now as free as a bird




 I got your cards that you bought me, ignored them
Because I thought calling would cause me a boredom
And of course I'm ashamed to admit
That every birthday wished me further away
From your midst 'til I couldn't face taking the risk
I guess I lost my faith a little bit
But then I realised a fundamental basic
More than any other you encouraged me to be creative
So it might quite belated, but I love you, Margaret and David

The Kelsey Bears
The Kelsey Bears
The Kelsey Bears

You were with me in my first days
But then I shut myself away during the worst days
A half-baked reason why I'm worth cake
But now evelen star birthday is part of my wordplay
And you bought me a calligraphy set
I'm ashamed to say I haven't done calligraphy yet
I was a little perplexed and treated with neglect
And yet now I make my living fiddling with text
Some of your gifts still bring back images
The little set of carve farmyard miniatures
The tree was my favourite piece
And it still is when I play with my niece
So yeah, I've done myself a favour at least
Now I'm back on the rails and I'm taming the beast
In a similar way to how my birthday cake did
It's time for you two to be celebrated
So it might be quit belated, but I love you, Margaret and David

The Kelsey Bears
The Kelsey Bears
The Kelsey Bears

Photography was obviously a hobby each of you wanted me to do
I never got into it properly
But now I love it, kind of like a kid with broccoli
My tastes took time to develop in the dark room
And now I can't do without it, honestly
You offered an option and I made you feel you'd been forgotten
Now the season's hot and Evesham's lost
Some leaves and blossoms but let's speak a little
Let's speak a little more often

The Kelsey Bears
The Kelsey Bears




 Hey!
Turn off whatever tune is on, and listen to this new song!
Its BlueXephos, the Yogscast, the Goon Squad
Whatever name you want to call us, Fine let's move on
And clarify a few things to avoid confusion
No need for Paypal, vouchers or a coupon
You can see us free of charge, Like a neutron
We won't blow the roof off, But we'll put a roof on
Both obsessed with little cubes and I'm not talking croutons
So get your shoes shone, to a sheen
Put your feet upon the futon and us upon the screen!

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, Digging a hole
I'm DanBull and I'm kicking a flow
Kicky kicky flow, Kicking a flow!

I'll introduce the duo, to the newest Youtube viewers
Xephos is Lewis and Simon's who Honeydew is
You'll lose all kinds of funny fluids, flatulation
Blood, sweat, tears, humors and the tangy taste
Of the runny gooey liquid oozing from a Jaffa Cake
We've got new tips, Music and Animations
So I wanna see your hips, thighs and your fanny shaking
Rihanna's nothing in comparison to Granny Bacon

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, Digging a hole
I'm Dan Bull and I'm kicking a flow
Kicky kicky flow, Kicking a flow!

Oh God! You're logged onto the YogPod
With more devout followers than the God squad
There's seldom, if ever, been such a realm or dimension
Bringing that much traffic, that you can hear the sound of the engines
Oh, and by the way, as well, did I mention
The fact that we've got more links than a Zelda convention?
You can tell there's a tension, but it probably isn't sexual
So any innuendo there's ineffectual
But mention Jaffa Cakes, and Simon practically masticates
He's dream meal's a stack of them upon a massive plate
I've even seen him eat a Jaffa Cake flavoured pasta bake
And after ate even more, instead of after eights
I wonder where exactly does he keeps them all stashed away
The number crunching is too massive to extrapolate

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, Digging a hole
I'm Dan Bull and I'm kicking a flow
Kicky kicky flow, Kicking a flow!

Dan Bull, Rapping on behalf of the Yogscast
Swinging harder than my diamond axe, when I'm chopping logs fast
I'm unsurpassed, when it comes to rap with Bombast
So turn up the volume knob and increase the contrast!
At long last, here's a rapper thats a gaming geek
Entertaining people, with amazing speed
The pick of the bunch, the bigger the swing, the bigger the punch
I pick up a thing up off the floor and start mining ore
(Cha, Cha, Cha, Cha, Ching)
Double-time rap with a bit of Minecraft
Hope Mojang didn't mind that!
Take a hit of my track, to the ear canal
You'll be like "Bleeding 'ell"
One, two, can you hear me now?
Oi, Honeydew, does it ring a bell?
It's been years since your ears have felt like this
You're isabel to my Israphel
Many men'll wanna make a rap track better than me
But they never will, because evidently, they lack the skill!
(AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!)

I am a dwarf and I'm digging a hole
Diggy diggy hole, Digging a hole
I'm DanBull and I'm kicking a flow
Kicky kicky flow, Kicking a flow!




 It's Genji Shimada
Armed with an array
Of arms and armour
The katana dragonblade
Slashing at a rapid rate
Happy to decapitate
Not the kinda fellow you wanna pass in an alleyway
What kinda fate shall await?
I don't wanna say
I don't wanna elaborate
He might retaliate
Spreading a fan of blades
Like jam or marmalade
You're a Jaffa Cake on a plate
He's Manson, you're Sharon Tate
Doesn't always get along with the family
Feud longer than the filler for an anime
Nearly killed by your brother but rebuilt
They cut through you like they cut through silk
Body of a cyborg
Soul of a warrior
Apologise now
Else soon you'll be sorrier
Brotherly love cannot be halted
Although it can falter
Blood is always thicker than water
Skipping up walls with the agility of millipedes
He could be employed as a portable guillotine
Neither man nor machine
He's - Going ham for the team

Oh no!
It's Genji chucking a hurricane of shuriken
And encouraging a low pose
So much more than the sum of his parts
He's whole
A steady blade balances the soul
(soul, soul, soul, soul)
A steady blade balances the soul

Oh no!
You better shush right now
Keep your lips tight
'Cause you just might be someone he dislikes
Bringing a shuriken to a fist fight
Slashing with his Wakizashi
Passing with a swift strike
Stopping you mid stride
So sit tight
'Cause it's like you're hitchhiking
Pitch dark at midnight
So you'll never see the viper you've been bit by
The light dims
The venom filling your insides
You haemorrhage heavily
Then eventually head heavenward
A fair way to go
Weaponry swinging like a seven wood
So you better shush right now
Keep your lips tight
Otherwise goodbye
See you on the flipside

Oh no!
It's Genji chucking a hurricane of shuriken
And encouraging a low pose
So much more than the sum of his parts
He's whole
A steady blade balances the soul
(soul, soul, soul, soul)
A steady blade balances the soul
A steady blade balances the soul




 LAST CIGARETTE

I'm back in this habit
The tobacconist grabbing a packet of fags
And passing it back as I hand him the cash
The transaction is tragic
A moment of magic, as I open the packet
And go for the wrapping, in only a moment I'll have this fag lit
The sad fact is I'm an addict, I need a hit
Of nicotine just to breathe and it's obscene
Just between us as a kid I disbelieved a brittle leaf
Mixed with heat could leave you feelin' incomplete without it
So blow the smoke out quick, you'll feel terrible
However you will have achieved something incredible

This is my last cigarette
I've done enough that I have to regret
This is my last cigarette
I've done enough that I have to regret

Bringin' a whole different sting
To the thing you hold in your fingers
They're stained since you imitated
The behavior of your favorite singer
I know you stroll to the cinema
And your role model's holding a Marlboro
The image is vivid and so you're sold the whole
Till your soul is a prisoner moulded in miniature rolled in a Rizzla
Held in a wrestling hold 'til the finisher
You're choked out, so blow the smoke out
No doubt : self-control's what's killing you


This is my last cigarette, I've done enough I have to regret
Without gasping for breath, asking for death
In return for the active effects
As many a heroin addict has said
It's addictive as smack, you'd be daft to inject
Skip the needle and the needle skips
As I tap my fag, let the ash hit the deck
Stood on the back step in the rain
And never complain 'til my fag's wet
Splashed out, cashing the cheque
Ash, ground; ground, ash; have you met ?


I stub the nub, enough's enough, I'm good
I would gladly have another fag, see but the fact is I'm done
It's off my chest, and I'm impressed
With my willpower, nothing less
Face my fate at 88 miles an hour, time travelling
As my life expectancy expands and I feel like a younger man
You need to fight the hunger, Dan
You're done, you can (you can) you can
I can (you can) I am




 Do you know the meaning of fear
When you fear to lose all that you hold dear
Do you know the feeling of being alone
On your knees in the rubble of your home?

They said that Moscow was a lost hope
But it's not though
It's just gone off the beaten track to meet a crossroad
Glossed over its past
Crossed over at last
You know it had to drop the sickle and hammer
To wield a crossbow
Claustrophobic moments frozen
Suppose the cock crows and
They hoped that after the blast
There'd be just cockroaches
When mutants prove a nuisance
You sense there's a uselessness to jurisprudence
So surely you need new solutions
Not just purely for amusement
You can do things to improve things
Become a student of their blueprints
Or just shoot them
Stab them
Grab them
Chop them
Whatever option stops them
Blood on my hands
And i've not got a moment to wash them
I'm going to aim lower
And throw in the flame thrower
You know i'm insane
So i just throw a grenade
Blow up
So much pain that i could throw up
Flat on my back
And i still twat an attacker that's at my heels
For real


Trying to stop us
Is like trying to stop a moving freight train
To protect our families
We are prepared to shoot and take pain
We stay awake through days and days
Ensure our group can stay safe
We'll take the aches and pains
And trade 'em for grenades and ak's
They say life is sacred
I say I can take it
In moments like this
It's our soul the light hits shining naked
They say life is sacred
I say I can take it
Pull the pin from my grenade
And bake it
While I wait to die degraded




 I don't read between the lines
Cause I can always turn back time
Mistakes are something I don't make
And I know that life is strange
But I'll never be the same

I am a girl with all the time in the world
Got time on my hands and time's on my side
Ahead of my time having the time of my life
But it's time for a change, time to rewind
Time for another plan, time to decide
And if I can rewind then I can read minds
Pulling together these pieces of time
Pull the hands back, take another path, another chance
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

I don't read between the lines
Cause I can always turn back time
Mistakes are something I don't make
And I know that life is strange
But I'll never be the same

Each photograph I take is a broken little token of a moment and a place
Another snapshot backed up on the laptop
I gather evidence against Blackwell lapdogs
This is for Kate Marsh
The way they baited her is way harsh
Why must they take time to break hearts
When all we want to do is stay aside, make art?
Arrange parts of time into a straight path
Time to pay your dealer and time's a great healer
I might faint from this time bomb
Hey Veela
My cerebral cortex is spinning a vortex
Clubs you're not invited to and things you never saw yet
I need a time out right now
I need to breathe back those hurtful words into my mouth
But as I wipe the blood from my nose I know that my time's up, another moment... froze
It's high time we had an everyday hero
In the right place at the right time, here, oh
I guess I've got time for one more line
So Cammie run that by me one more time

I don't read between the lines
Cause I can always turn back time
Mistakes are something I don't make
And I know that life is strange
But I'll never be the same




 You alright, fella?
Yeah, mate
I ent seen you in ages, chap

How’s it going mate?
What up, mucka?
Me, I’m doing bloody great
I’m a trucker

Ha!
Pull out the gaffer’s yard in a large cab
Ah, that feeling rubber rubbing on the Tarmac
My, my, I see the skyline fly by
Due to my tyre size, I’m sure I’m a mile high
Energy sending me serenity, Firefly
A soiled dirty magazine is my private life
So if you see my lorry rocking in a lay-by
It may be quite wise not to knock and say hi
The way I pull up, it’s hard to miss it
But if I leave it here I’ll have a parking ticket
And if I catch a traffic cop who starts to stick it
I’ll tell him where exactly up his arse I’ll kick it
When I park like this, then I ooze style, look
Never mind if it’s risking a huge pile-up
I park it like it’s hot, a used fire truck
You’re behind the times, bruv: "Ooh, dial-up…"
Man, trucking is the life and I live it
Now I want to pimp my ride, call up Xzibit
Tell him attach some lights and a different trim
Go faster stripes and some wicked rims
Hypnotised by the strobe of the cat’s eyes
And when the rain flows, I am baptised

How’s it going mate?
What up, mucka?
Me, I’m doing bloody great
I’m a trucker

Forget that big rig over the road
Racing past him like nobody knows
I’m not overly loaded down with a load of wheels
So many going round, it’s unreal
I feel appeal in the cab of my truck
So I seal the deal and peel off like a scab, yuk
Call it meals on wheels
‘cause I’m delivering four tonnes of peas
On four tonnes of steel
From city scenery to greenery
This is the epitome of machinery
It’s just me and the road, woop woop!
Man, I feel like Toad, poop poop!
My windscreen is an ever-shifting picture
From Carlisle to Calais, Koln, Katowice
I stop off at Rostock before turning
And burning rubber all the way back home to Birmingham

How’s it going mate?
What up, mucka?
Me, I’m doing bloody great
I’m a trucker

Life of a trucker
Wouldn’t change it for anything, man
Shove your office job up your arse, mate
It’s just me and the road now...
Me and the road




 Chris, that's enough, start rapping

Realising that life isn't everything that it's meant to be
 And changed their destiny
Coincidentally, I'm earning more than the minimum
But failing when I'm saving the pounds cause I keep on spending 'em
Still, I got a mortgage down so that I can afford it
Because now my house even though I'm  my shit
Reminiscing as I'm sitting in the kitchen
Bout the things that I do then all the things seems that I've lived it
Grateful for the 
Cause it provides us with a distraction from what this life does
Even though  is still a place I hate to go
But as long as the ceiling's leaking I'll be needing to, so I'll forego, yo
Until the day I retire and buy my slippers
Me and the missus are doing gardening or washing dishes
Getting pissed, just whiffs on the sly
Cause life's a bugger then you die

Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why I write rhymes
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why we aim high
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why I write rhymes
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
We fight to survive

I woke up early on my birthday
Hungover in the worst way
I'm 28, that means I've outlived Kurt Cobain
My physical frame's in pain because I'm lazy
No motivation with the aspiration of Jay Z
Most days I'm slacking off, jacking off
If there's a project I'm working on I'll probably slack it off
Some days I'd like to shoot to fame, exercise and lose some weight
Other times I want to goof and play computer games
Weekends and weekdays don't mean a thing to me
I'm the hardest-working slacker in the industry
Wake up when it's bedtime and doze when the sun shines
I even have a shower and a change of clothes sometimes
Boot up my PC, loop up a beat
And keep repeating it till we complete the piece, easy peasy
No stress, I had to bed and catch some Zs
And then repeat the process till I've amassed a stack of Ps
Never had to sell drugs or be a violent mugger
But believe me, I've seen how life's a bugger
Before it pulls you down, it lifts you so high
It's a real bloody bugger, then you die

Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why I write rhymes
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why we aim high
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why I write rhymes
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
We fight to survive




 So, is anyone surprised to know that Logan Paul's
Uploaded a video that's broken social protocol?
Vlogging at a hanging scene as if it was the local mall
'Cause hanging with your bros and cracking jokes matters most of all
Is there ever an unspoken thought that doesn't pass that oaken jaw?
It's time to give this showman's mode of promo an overhaul
I'll rip your torso open raw, grip your pulse's frozen core
Shove it in the oven with the other leftover roasts to thaw
I thought you were the most mature and grown up Paul brother
You know, the secret favourite one of both of your mother?
I'm sure that you probably even disappointed Jake
But this is insignificant, there's an even bigger point to make
Real life isn't a video, not everything is content
The absence of a no doesn't equal consent
Some things are better left unsaid or unsent
Sometimes making the right choice might even lose you one cent
Once I filmed an accident, a jeep came off an overpass
Landed on another car below with an explosive crash
It could have been a hit on Reddit, but I didn't share it
'Cause there were real people injured and it didn't merit
Me exhibiting their tragedy like it was entertainment
So when I read you did the same I put my pen to paper
Not that it's my place to stick my nose in
But I'm getting sick of the excuses of those few who condone it
Saying "But he's already dead, he's not even aware of it"
That's true, but imagine if you were that fellow's relative
Logging on to see the news of your missing loved one
And seeing the noose and you giggling, it's just wrong
And the fact that you censored his face
Doesn't change the basic reason that you went to the place
You say you went to look for ghosts? Ghosts aren't real
But suicide is and those wounds can't heal
And if you can't feel you've overstepped a boundary
And if you can't say sorry without shouting "It's about me"
And if you can't comprehend the respect that you lost today
Then Logan bro, I don't know what to say
Your apology was hollow, a borrowed piece of sorrow
Hoping the drama would just become obsolete tomorrow
If you really meant to raise awareness of a thing this sensitive
How come the tags you added didn't even mention it?
Instead you picked the words "comedy" and "maverick"
So I'm sorry, but your apology? I'm not having it
Check your head and admit what you were there for
To disrespect the dead and the people that they cared for
You say you were in a moment of shock and couldn't cope with it
Is that the same moment you edited and uploaded it?
Filmed an extra bit, hyped it up and then promoted it
And at that time your mind was telling you to go for it?
Now there's no damn dispute you go for low hanging fruit
But this is still the lowest Logang's produced
Before this happened I was no fan of you
Suspected you were reckless, now I know that it's true




 I'd like to tell you
Some uncomfortable truths
This will now happen

Within a few years
The elephants are gonna die
But they're less important to our ecosystem than a fly
(Why?)
All of our actions
Are ultimately selfish
Even when we help the helpless
We're thinking what we can get out of this
No need for an apology
It's just biology
But could be stronger in a colony
And honestly
I can't debate the fact my claims will be debated
I can't overstate the fact I'm underrated
I can't stand or understand the fact I'm hated
I tried being understated
'till I realized it was overrated
Your tablet phone was made by modern-day slave labour
The world today is a race to make us chase paper to the grave
Spend, spend, spend! but make sure you save for later
Haters are gonna hate
But maybe what they're sayin' will save ya'
Insane or saviour
Am I a liar
Pariah
Messiah
Or a normal guy with a desire to inquire?
I'm adding fuel to fire
I draw the ire I decided the dividing line
Like a binary multiplier
We're all bullied in school
But never did it ourselves
That doesn't add up
You are a bully without knowing as well
You're guilty of stuff you'd have others thrown in a cell for
So look close to home
Before telling him what we're going to hell for

Look at the elephant!
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant

Now
Human rights are universal
'cause they mean nothing unless given to the worst of us
Regardless of what people do
Murderers are people too
Who legally you're equal to
There's no line between good and evil, dude
There's only actions and intentions
A result of chemical reactions and events
And any ethical infractions
That you care to add to that are an invention
But don't pretend that that's an invitation
To act a twat
'cause you're ingrained with empathy
Advanced behavior
Saviour
But you have more empathy for people of your own race
For those whose skin tone fits that of your own face
(Don't blame me, I'm just saying)
The capacity's in all of us for genocide
It's best to face the demon inside than try to run and hide
Nazis were people, too
(What?)
If you'd have been in their circumstances
The certain chance is you would be one, too
Pedophiles are people, too
That's their sexuality
It's not a choice, they're not criminals
Unless they breach legality
And when the age of consent changes internationally
Ranging from 8 to 18
Then it's a massive leap
You may feel uncomfortable
But that's the truth, actually
Like the fact that you're a walking, talking poo factory

Look at the elephant!
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant

Within a few years
The elephants are gonna die
But they're less important to our ecosystem than a fly
(Oh my!)
And transsexual is genetically their birth gender
It's burnt into the embers of their cells like the Earth's center
We can pretend
But in the end eventually
Identities in consequential conscious beings are non-essential
Disagree?
Each piece of meat you eat was born of suffering
Most reasons for eating it recede to nothing when you look at it
And similarly with abortion
A significant portion of the arguments
Can apply to infants that are already born
If you say you refuse to go back to coat hangers
Then the NRA could claim to say 'We won't go back to daggers!'
You may say 'It's none of our business as a cis-head prick'
But I'm not one for indifference
I'm at odds with it is what it is
Regardless of whose gob's admitting it
So if you've got a problem we're listing it
It's probably the cognitive dissonance kickin' it
Some of your most deep and strong beliefs are wrong
Mine too
Read along to the lyrics of this song
You'll probably see the ones
To err is human
To forgive divine
To redefine what we believe is right
Is to see behind the scenes to really feel alive?
To be reminded of the blood
The guts
The bones
And the meat inside
I really tried
But this feeling can't even be described
It's too revealing
I can't be surprised
We try to keep it hiding at times
Fear takes over
So like Peter we deny
But the beauty within reason
Seems it cannot be defined
Everyone will compromise their morals for enough money
And farts will always, always be funny

Look at the elephant!
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant

You are going to die
No, really. Listen to me
You
Are
Going
To die
Now I don't care about advances in cryogenics
Or the infinite universe theory
You
Are
Going
To die




 Oh, low lights
Low lights
Lights that are low
Lights that are low
I ain't talkin' about highlights
They got too much limelight
If we lay in low light
Then it's no light
Yeah, I'm talking about low lights
Low good to go lights
Those steal the whole goddamn show lights
Them good ol' (coughs)
Low lights




 Look
Everybody dies, some just need a little help
Death is a mercy and I've enough to go around
So when I pull my guns out
Don't duck on my account
I must just muck around and shoot a smiley face into the fucking ground
Trick shot?
The trick is not to get shot
Mix rock with hip-hop on top of a sick drop
You don't have the heart for this and you don't know the half of this
With half a heart I miss my love so much I can't exist
I was never not together with Senna
Until Thresh rolled up, and stole her soul forever
Fuck Hecarim and Thresh
They're in a mess with Mordekaiser
Relentlessly pursue them and then shoot until I've torn 'em right up
For a hired gun
Taking your life is violent fun
Don't try and run
Cause I decide when you and I are done
Killing the undead
Until it is sunset
And still I'm not done yet
Piercing you would be a delight
So I use the piercing light
My finger's on Q, the Lightslinger, might sting your ears and eyes
My bars amaze, my ardent blaze, will leave you bleeding, scarred and grazed
The closest I ever get to remorse
Feeling regret for Hecarim's horse
You're talking the talk, while I'm walking the walk
So to me
You're just another corpse!




 Let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
(Ah ah)
Let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
Ay
Let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
Ay
Let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
(Ah)

Raver, straight out the favela
Bringing a breakdown with the fader (yeah)
Make soundwaves of countless flavours
Wow, true musical taste synesthesia (whoa)
Going to change up your vision of the same stuff
'Til you're tingling with sensations of elation (oh)
Exhilaration, admit it, the feeling is thrilling
Fulfilling and chilling
No wonder the kid on the stage is making a killing
He's got millions, top billing
So stop feeling sorry for yourself
And start singing it:
Ay, let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
What, turn up the EDM
Increase the speed, boost the BPM
No middle of the road, no medium
No stopping these flows 'til we see the end (oh)

One good thing about music
When it hits you feel no pain
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
We've heard music only makes existence richer
Lúcio throws the switch
Tones and notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture (whoah)

All systems go, going to go the distance
Going to give assistance, can I get a witness
Firing on all pistons, pistols
It's futile trying to put up a resistance (ah)
Blowing up transistors
Flicking the switch so damn quick, his trigger finger is blistered
EQ flicking the frequency so frequently
The beat and he could even conceivably
Conceive a fetus, just so he or she
Could feature in remix releases
Oh Jesus, if it wasn't that egregious
That lyric would have been prestigious
But I don't know where to draw the line
True music knows no borderline
So let me divulge a little thought of mine
If you're bored of music, then you're bored of life

One good thing about music
When it hits you feel no pain
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
We've heard music only makes existence richer
Lúcio throws the switch
Tones and notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture

Pile in, overpowering to anyone who can hear
So hurry up, let the phonographic magic carry you
Playing solo, Joe Satriani jamming on a strat
Through a pedal with a fat 'wah', Sharia
Taking the sound barrier, breaking it down, hell yeah
Shaking the ground, while you were waiting around, dallying
Now I hate to tell you, but you're making yourself embarrassing
Without comparison
So mate, sit down and have a think
You good?
Put your headphones on
Take it to the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
Peekaboo, beat going to boom, keep in the groove (uh)
He going to move, sneak in the booth, speaking the truth
Speeding the group, healing them too, feeling anew
Revealing the true meaning of music and speaking of tunes
You can stream this through the service you prefer
'Cause you deserve it dude
Perfect, woo

One good thing about music
When it hits you feel no pain
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
We've heard music only makes existence richer
Lúcio throws the switch
Tones and notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture (whoah)

Take it to the top, top (take it to the top)
Bass gonna drop, drop (bass gonna drop)
Take it to the top, top (take it to the top)
Bass gonna drop, drop (bass gonna drop)
Take it to the top, top (take it to the top)
Bass gonna drop, drop (bass gonna drop)
Take it to the top, top (take it to the top)
Bass gonna drop (bass gonna drop)




 Yeah, I'm Vito Scaletta
When it comes to being a G there's no one better
I'm a vet straight fresh out of Operation Husky
Put my life on the line but the state doesn't trust me
I came out of Italy, specifically Sicily
'Til I shipped in with the immigrants to the Big City
Live gritty!
Had a hard start but still we party hard and sing ditties
Living large, drinking with them broads with the big titties
But when you're living big you tend to run up debts
And clearing credit here's not a case of signing another cheque
We deal with suitcases stuffed with banknotes
And debt collectors who aren't too shy to shank throats
When there's money to pay, you better pay, prick
And if you can't make it, you better take it
Cause if you have to twist an arm, you may as well break it
Get in the fucking car, you're getting taken on a day trip

In a city that won't sleep
We live the American Dream
And in a city that won't sleep
We live the American Dream
If it's God that has made man
Then a made man is God (Amen!)
If it's God that has made man
Then a made man is God (Amen!)

I'm a Mafia Don, stacking the funds
Trying to hold me back, what kind of crack are you on?
I roll with a Beretta 38 and my friend Joe
But I know we're all alone in the end though
Every road leads there, no need to go dead slow
So speed up because I said so
Or be left in the red glow of the tail lights
Life's a driving test and you can't fail twice
Ain't going back to jail, you can inhale on my tail pipe
Make no mistake, I'm running the Bay
If you've something to say
I'll aim my submachine gun and then spray
A man of grand ambitions but still I'm humble and pray
Hungry to take over, never done for the day
I came reluctantly in to the Underworld
Tried to play it straight but it sucked me back in
Guess I'm not done with the girl
So I made a date with fate and aimed to take everything I could
And 'til I end up in Satan's flames
It's never been as good

In a city that won't sleep
We live the American Dream
And in a city that won't sleep
We live the American Dream
If it's God that has made man
Then a made man is God
If it's God that has made man
Then a made man is God
Gangster...




 Yo
I'm commander Shepard, the man with the method to brandish a weapon and then handle the Geth with it
I'm an effortless hero, my rhymes shine brighter than element zero
Bringing more fire than emperor Nero, it's the end of an era Yo!
There's something mysterious with Saren Arterius committing violence against Nihlus I'm furious
I'll chase him from place to place base to base until we're face to face I'm serious
From the Sirius Relay to Artemis Tau, I'll tighten the net I'm not far from him now
I'll fight all the Geth 'till that bastard is found, and leave his heart in the ground
I'm the southpaw outlaw scoundrel bringing down more tools than a whole ground force
Listen out now fool it's pretty damn doubtful that I'll be sitting down with the citadel council
The reapers are keen to bring about your downfall so me and my team are about to flout laws
I'll introduce you to the whole of my party, Garrus, Liara T'Soni, and Tali
Wrex, Kaidan, Ashley, Joker, the army, you roll with an asari older than Atari
A krogan that'll leave you cold within a heartbeat, my teams hotter than a stolen Ferrari
Can a Volus go shoulder to shoulder with me? Hardly, my ship's seen off more foes than a Somali's
So we're going on safari, to the far reaches it'll be gnarly, seeing stranger creations than Dali, and breaking more faces than Arnie
Mass Effect, Two

Blown to pieces, and reassembled, I don't believe this, it's bleeding mental
But then again, with theses credentials, can they be blamed for believing me essential?
I don't wanna be nervously lunching with Cerberus, I'd prefer to be punching a journalist
Souping up all my guns for the skirmishes, in which I'll puncture the firmament, permanent
I'm bringing a lyrical mass effect, my skill it'd kill a billion million massive geth
Commander Shepard's, formidable syllables, hitting the pinnacle, it is a miracle that commands mass respect
Incontestable, I'm a professional, but my new boss is less than respectable, so you better cover up your testicles, cos my next method's something of a spectacle
More fresh and raw, than a vegetable, coming from the underground with the hunger of a Thresher Maw
I leave the Rachni with a black-eye, slap Pyjak with a backhand never act nice
Rap lines sharper than a cacti, or the bite of a Varren on a barren planet
Baptised in flame, rise again in fact I'm insane
Providing pain, back from the afterlife packing an appetite to invade
This isn't a driving range but I leave you with eighteen holes inside of your brain
Like a swiss cheese, bitch please, you'll disbelieve the manner in which I kick frees
Bringing Sci-Fi to your Hi-Fi is the highlight of your lifetime, with ease
This is just the beginning




 Listen
Imagine Dan sat in the back of an ambulance
Chatting to Adam and telling him that he's had enough of this madness
Fuck if that actually happened I haven't the faintest clue
The concussion had damaged my grey matter and mushed my brain to goo
But when I unravelled the bandage to see my face anew
My eyes' vacant gaze described what I should aim to do
And that's whatever the fuck it takes to make it through
Enough pussying about, now I'm a sabretooth, and nature's brutal
In the old days I used to
Say I didn't need to pay my dues
Ha - how far was I away from truth?
And in the old days I used to wait for opportunities to happen
Now I make my opportunities and grab them

What doesn't kill will not make you stronger
But at least you're going to live a little longer
So take everything right on the chin
And never ever ever give in

I was nearly a limited edition
Because I could have been swimming with the fishes
But being in critical condition
Would give me the volition
To fulfill my mission as a skilled musician, ambition:
Kill competition with my ill compositions
And then build my position up until I'm a religion
(Roll up, roll up)
My shirt sleeves, I see the vision
Turn the key in the ignition
Burn and speed into the distance
Even if it means you're gonna be in a collision
Well at least you've given us a firm reason to listen
Desert the feeble disposition
Learn to feed on criticism
Spurn the media's derision
Earn your keep and keep on living
Hurting people is a piece of piss
But it requires guts to be kind
I don't know why I didn't see this shit
I must have been blind
But even despite that dust in my eye will never settle
I will never bite the dust 'til I die

What doesn't kill will not make you stronger
But at least you're going to live a little longer
So take everything right on the chin
And never ever ever give in

Look - whether you're holding a bunch of roses
Or holding a gun just know this
You've got to soldier on, roll with the punches, throw fists
Keep holding on, lift that boulder on your shoulders strong
Souls are one thing, but the body's been evolving long
Before you ever knew the pain
It's hurting me
Recuperation is a state of elevation
Gave me endless days to meditate and strengthen every failing I had
Being a patient gave me patience and determination
Dedication to bettering Dan
Man, I've taken beatings, taken knees to the face
My bloodstream stained the streets of this place
Where I reside, seeped through the pavement
Making me a piece of the neighbourhood
Could you keep it more real than me right there if you tried?
From the stitches in my elbow to the tears in my side
My scars are badges of honour, I bear them with pride
They stitched my scalp, fixed my split eyebrow
And another time they took out a bit of my bowel
Being a patient gave me patience and determination
Helped me to see a way out of the maze, found an escape
Came out of the daze
How many ways more will I be knocked to the ground, now?
But they named me Danny Boy
Because you're never going to keep me down

I stand hand in hand with Anonymous and anybody that says
Theft and copying’s apples and oranges
O-R-G EFF, every single one of us
The MPAA RIAA’s probably got us on their list
I’m no economist but I know something’s gone amiss
When filesharers and terrors become synonymous
If politicians want to think we haven’t got the foggiest
We’ll send them on their holidays to wherever Mitt Romney is
They’re in the pockets of the lobbyists, it’s obvious
The rights of the rock star are higher than the hobbyist’s
So you can gossip about Kim and what a nob he is
But he’s telling the authorities to lick his lolly stick
Love him or hate him, Kim Dotcom
There’s no debating that he’s got this thing locked on

Raise a million man army in twenty four hours
To battle it challenges the extent of your powers
What government wouldn’t allow us some privacy inside machines?
A coven of cowards, your trust is something I’d like to see
Because if the government doubt us then why should we comply?
We seem to be decried as pirates either side we try to keep
That’s why we need a site like these as privacy provides relief
The way in which Mega’s increasing beggars belief and evidently
You’ll never police it, believe it, so you better just leave it
‘cause to try and stop a file locker’s setting off a firecracker
I’ll grab the weapon and then set it up on my attacker

New Zealand police showed the true meaning of sneakiness
As a PR move a seizure like a movie scene is genius
Repelling through ceilings they knew media would eat it up
And boo the bejeezus out of users who pursue freedom
Knew what it’d do to the thief in us
But if they’re through with deceiving us
We’ll chew through any truthiness they shoot at us
Like a beaver does
‘cause when I keep my stuff under lock and key
The fuzz have no business, peeping at my docs
‘til we can see the warrant please (Where is it?)
‘til then you keep your fingers off of me
And let me smash the intellectual property monopoly
Through dropping speech on rocking beats
And here’s a prophecy
My skill’s the most effective DRM
No one could copy me

 Hey Joshua, I got an idea
What?
Let's do rapping
About what?
I don't know, anything
Anything?
Computer games
Yeah?
MegaMan, for example
Or ProtoMan
MegaMan
ProtoMan
MegaMan
ProtoMan

Who's the best man?
Is that a question?
A double take, we attack 'till your head spins
You know it's Mega Man
No, it's Proto Man
We 'bout to bust up the track you selected
It's not like Red vs. Blue, see
We got time, don't expect a movie
So you start to run
But we're far from done
Cause literally my arm's a gun
(2x)

It's the boy in the blue suit, blue hair and blue boots
With arms like mine, I should probably shoot hoops
I rock a Mega Buster
You got a feather duster
I'll uppercut you in the head because I never trust ya
Dr. Wily's not so highly qualified as his title implies
It's a pile of lies
Like every time he complies
Apologizing and cries
Before recidivising right into the violent life

Yo, it's Proto Man
You know your bro, fam
Punch you in the shoulder, then I crush you like a soda can
I make your motor jam, loading up my cannon
Then we taking over from America to Tokyo, Japan
Your demise, see, I hold it in my poker hand
You’re slower than iPhones from 2007
Call me a shadow while I’m hiding from the Light
As a rapper, not surprising that you copy my lines
Like damn!

Who's the best man?
Is that a question?
A double take, we attack 'till your head spins
You know it's Mega Man
No, it's Proto Man
We 'bout to bust up the track you selected
It's not like Red vs. Blue, see
We got time, don't expect a movie
So you start to run
But we're far from done
Cause literally my arm's a gun

So come and rock with Rock as I rock with Roll
Sidescrolling through the whole of your soul, ohhh!
My cranium is made of titanium
I'm running rings around fake lies like Alien
I'm better than Proto Man, Fire Man, Cut Man
Bomb Man, Time Man, Ice Man
Guts Man, Method Man, Redman
I'm way ahead, man
And what's my name again? Say it!
Mega Man!

We taking out the Bass and the Treble
I’m made of the metal
And waiting forever to play on the level we came to settle
You say you’re special while I stay the rebel
You pacifists have to get your a**es kicked on a bangin' instrumental
You patriotic fool claiming you’re not a tool
Everybody’s sure you’re megaderp, so stop refusing the truth
I got my Proto Shield blockin' haters out
Shades on my helmet cause my name’s renowned
And they say wow!

Who's the best man?
Is that a question?
A double take, we attack 'till your head spins
You know it's Mega Man
No, it's Proto Man
We 'bout to bust up the track you selected
It's not like Red vs. Blue, see
We got time, don't expect a movie
So you start to run
But we're far from done
Cause literally my arm's a gun
(2x)

Robots are machines that follow orders
I’m a machine that doesn’t
So what does that make me?




 Oh bugger! Noes!
Megaupload's cover's blown!
Even without SOPA, they're never coming home
Although, it's good to see America's priority is
Fostering a trustworthy relationship overseas
Make money giving away things for free (ah!)
Why can the majors do similarly?
See, it seems silly to me not to persecute
The perpetraitor, but the method of delivery (wee!)
And if indeed it's true
Then we need to shoot
The postman for evil deeds we do (ooh!)
And should you receive a nasty letter
Then Bang!
I hope Postman Pat gets better
Seize his red van, vivisect his cat
Burn all the letters in his sack, you'll never get them back
If ever that did happen there'd be revolution in Greendale
Retribution and we've failed
Unless we take a stand, make a plan
And for legal reasons I better clarify that I'm not inciting any criminal activity whatsoever, merely civil protest to show that I'm just rather annoyed about the fact that I use Megaupload to host my own album
And now the majors have taken it down - what?
How the hell is this supposed to be helping independent artists
Grow to be healthily self sufficient?
Well - it isn't
Given that your only future sell is in a prison
But I'll tell you now there's a million similar sites
You could shut one down every night and never stem the tide
So with regards to Megaupload
I suggest we get a truckload of files and set them up so that
We can prove the internet isn't a place for disrespect
And if we stick together, they'll never disconnect

Us
From it
Hopefully
With any luck
Blimey
It's a bit of a bugger, isn't it?




 A'ight fuck that shit, word word, (yeah) fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin? (Yeah, fuck it) We gonna do a lil sum like this, y'know what I'm sayin? (Yeah... yes) Keep it on and on and on and on-in. (I am, I'm keeping it on) Know'm sayin, Big Nas, (yes) Grand Wizard, what is it. (Dan Bull as well) Ha-ha it's like, You know what I'm sayin. (Yup, I know what you're saying. I think.)

I rap for revolutionaries who disestablish materialism
I rap for anybody that'll care to listen
I rap for kids and senior citizens, dissidents
I voice the voiceless, harmonise their dissonance
My mission is every changing but ever the same
It's simply to sing songs about everything
Remember the good times while looking to the future
The style of a typewriter with the mind of a computer
I feel the poetry flow in me
Listen to dope MCs and still I  and hopefully
I'll never love till when I look above there's nobody
Been developing my set-up since I left the ovary
Look I'm sorry, that's just the way it's going to be
Too focused on my vocal needs to pick up soap and clean
So I have a very faint odour like I'm potpourri
I used to mask my BO by just smoking weed
Hah, now the funny stains will explain
Don't take  regardless of race down memory lane
So tough ditty (It's like that y'all)

"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Coming outta Queensbridge"

One for the money, two for even more money
And three for even more even more money
I never spent my days gangbanging
I don't even know what gangbanging is
But I had a gang hanging out in the park
That's something I've already covered
On my first album, Safe, the second track – Summer
To be a rapper and environmentalist in Borough
I can't decide between a Hybrid or a Hummer
I feel an obligation to be at one with nature
But my flame of consumerism is a complication
Impudent with it, with an honesty that's greater
Please take off the , man, I wanna see your face, look
I'm not a statist, racist, or a rapist
I'm just a little bit afraid of the faces
That goes for veiled ladies and riot police
Pull aside your Guido mask, anonymous, try it please
Because anonymity does have advantages I see
But I'd rather chat to you without some fabric in between
I'm a human being and so are you, we should be proud
To come together in a crowd and fight for what we're not allowed
But what about to right to privacy, we live a life on CCTV
And I'm not keen on playing hide and seek
I bring the past to the future 
Then you're invited to my team to ride beside me to the dream
Reminisce about the best of things everyday
And take a trip down memory lane


(Premier Scracthing)
The most dangerous MC is...."Coming out of Queensbridge"
(*mock scratching* Coming out of Bromsgrove
I haven't got a turntable)
"Ya number one and y'know where you're from"




 Warrior filled with metal gears
Walking the size of a Metal Gear
Refer to me as Raiden
Feel the wrath of my blade and view my metal gear
Slick as a Gray Fox, with the telekinetic ability
Of a Psycho Mantis with the moves of an Ocelot
I’mma show the whole world what my plan is
Domination – that’s day by day
In a Metal Gear Rex or a Metal Gear Ray
Launching a rocket, predicting your moves
Plug into a whole new socket
Why? ‘Cause I’m watching, I’ll sever your arms
While reading the data on your memory card
You’re never as hard, I’m solid like Plissken
When rhyming my mission, snipe from the distance
A lyrical depiction of greatness
A Son of Liberty with guns of the Patriots
On a substance where I need water
Or I’ll trip out and won’t be a Peace Walker
King Cobra, snake eater
When I start rising I’ll blaze speakers
Til the day that 6 is a massive name
Making rappers go ghost, bringing phantoms pain
A master swordsman that you can’t handle
Solid Shizzy with Liquid Dan Bull
You spit sick gamble, lose your profits
You’ll be crying wolf with no way to stop it
I’m a Big Boss, turning artists purple
Bringing all the sorrow, best call the Colonel
Raw for sure, yo! You ain’t on my level
Hence why I possess your woman like Meryl
Never gonna settle, I’m never gonna be suffering
Waving a finger right at the government
Weapons at the ready from my heads to my socks
Like Snake’s trademark, I’ll put you in a box
Snake
Snake
Dan Bull

Sneaking around, not a peep or a sound
From my feet on the ground, but if people have found
Me then I down these with a leap
And a bound, then leave like a thief in a crowd
I’m the lead lethal elite
Look at me, can you see the physique? Sweet
I need it for griefing and breaching the peace
When I’m breaching a keep, but I keep it discrete
You will see what I mean when I creep knee-deep
In the evil and leave with not even a squeak
To me, people seem inane
And when they see my name it doesn’t mean the same thing
Me? I’ve got the meanest aim, think
I was a Green Beret, I never squeeze and pray
You better leave in haste, believe you may
Never see the day or breathe again
A snake in the grass
I lay awake in your path
And they are making a massive
Mistake if they ask it
I’ve faith in the task – their face
I’m taking it fast, and breaking
It past the point their next
Of kin could name it from snaps
You’re not up to the skilled task
Your style’s like me, it gets old real fast
Genetically modified, what a guy
So I often wonder why I have only got one eye
I’m a clone, so I’m not alone
Grown in a test tube, I’m the best dude that I know
I’m a son of Big Boss, but I don’t give a toss
Because I’m a bigger boss, pick a sod and flip them off
I’m a raw dude, cutting all through you waves
Like the blade of a sawtooth through a raw fruit
But call me Snake Plissken and you’re risking
A major plagiaristic lawsuit




 This is addressed to the silly little children
Spoiling a legitimate protest
And giving a bad name to an otherwise worthy cause

You bunch of fucking wannabe anarchists
Don't you see the irony
Anti-government
But you want the government to provide the 
I agree that we could do
Without the higher fees
But that doesn't mean that I believe
That I have license to be violent, see
What? If something's not much in your taste
You can act in disgrace (what?)
Mate, if that was the case
I'm fucking smashing your face
And if you really hate the bourgeoisie (yeah?)
Then why're you so happy for them to pay your degree? (uhh)
And just because they're raising all the fees, it doesn't mean
That you have  to smash glass in the face of the police
If that appauling course of action
Was truly for the best (yes?)
I would have thought you'd have the support of the NUS (yes)
So get off the roof, you stupid goon and go back to your room
There must be something a little more productive that you can do
So don't leave the halls of residents
'Til you come up with with more developments
'Cause at the most you're an embarrassment, and at the least
You're irrelevant

And if you wanna save yourself some money
And help the "oppressed working classes"
Then take your fucking 40£ sweatshop manufactured Che Guevara t-shirt back to the Gap store, you prick




 Oh Mojang, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well
Enough said
Dear Microsoft, we've got something to say
You just traded for the biggest Indie game
In the Indie game
It just doesn't do it justice, just to pin it with the Indie name
It's amazing just how big this thing became
It's been through stages
Came straight from a Beta on a forum into history's pages
But now the fanbase weeps through flushed and misty faces
No wish to see the game with Windows 8's interfaces
Listen, it isn't as if we hate you, we're just resisting changes
Gamergate displayed it pays to listen when players are pissed and dangerous
It's over, still I cling
I don't know what else I can play
Oh Mojang, I can feel
The soaring overheads
I know it's business, but there is this, look
I know it's business, but there is this, look
This game means so so much to so many people
I can't think of a single community with any equal
There's the streamers, the hardcore and casual players
PC, console, mobile, YouTubers
Making a living from ads on players
Construction on creative, Bukkit, Tekkit, Hunger Games
And tons of countries' young teenagers
That've become eachothers' neighbours
Steve's become a saviour, please don't leave him to become
A slave here, I pray to you, Mojang staff
Please be happy
Corporate suits, don't be brutes
Loud, loutish logo, treat them kindly
Though they need you
More than they love you
You might think I'm daft, asking you to be nice to Minecraft
But I don't mind that, so laugh, my life is quite naff
I've an appetite for trite trash, many nights I've pined, sat
With wine or sank a pint glass, and passed the time with Minecraft
The game's a mate in the bad times I've had
The sad times I've had
But when I craft, those sad times don't matter, no
So you might think I'm daft, asking you to be nice to Minecraft
But I don't mind that, as long as you look after Minecraft
Don't mind that, as long as you look after Minecraft
It's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And Notch even spoke to me and said
"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if your channel's so good
Then why do you stream alone tonight?"
I know
'Cause tonight is just like any other night
"That's why you're on your own tonight
With your mine and your farms
While they're in each other's arms"
It's so easy to craft, it's so easy to slay
It takes strength to descend into the mine
It's so easy to laugh and poke fun at Bill Gates
It takes guts to attempt such a buy
Oh Mojang
Oh Mojang
Oh Mozza, I can feel
The DMCA over my head
This is a parody, don't grief, Content ID
Please




 Oh, sod it, it hurts but I'll reveal the truth
Sometimes I'd like to curl up and be a recluse
I mean it, it isn't simply an excuse
I'm really feeling too weak to deal with you
Do you see what I've been reduced to?
A shadow of myself with the bleakest future
I zone out, open myself
And only hope someone else knows what I'm about
It's lonely when you've felt so low you can't help
But want to go for broke, and throw in the towel
Go to the cabinet, open the tablets
Overdose and lay comatose in the bath with the tap running
That's not what I planned when I had hope though
I once was the man in the photo
Laughing with no load on my back and no hassle
And the path to my happiness, that was still open
In the past had I known that all that was over
Perhaps I'd have known how to claw back those years
I was sober, no drugs, I had a girlfriend
But now I'm a loner that hopes the world ends
How did I fall into all this torment
I never portended this result then
I wanted four kids, a mortgage, a crib with all the fittings
But all I'm getting's more bored and morbid
According to laws of physics actions all cause others
Yeah? So howcome I don't have some sort of lover?
It's all just rubbish, all religions and philosophical offerings
Of knowledge on the source of our suffering
It's just a thing thought up by people who lie to decieve
All the world to lie at their feet
So I'm actually beginning to believe
That perhaps it's time for me to leave

Cos I'm a misfit - I'm not an alpha male
Misfit - my health's too frail
I'm a misfit - worn out and pale
Misfit - I'm bound to fail
I'm a misfit - your inane conversation
Misfit - puts a strain on my patience
I'm a misfit - please take me away from all
Misfit - this pain and frustration
I'm a misfit

Do I freak you out with what I speak about?
Like I'm not even allowed to reveal myself
Cos it breaches how people seem to chat
It seems they really don't want to hear the real Dan
But piss off, I'm just not interested in small talk
I'd much more discuss thoughts on Bush, war and such
All the fuss all you fucks all get flustered with football
Means fuck all to me cos it's just sport, and that's all
Don't you ever sit and think about the bigger things
And how to figure things out that aren't just physical?
The little bit of history we fit into
How we're writ into it, and what it means to us
I feel I don't ever belong, what a misfit
But see, don't get me wrong, I'm not a thick kid
Cross my fingers, I've got witnesses of this
I think it's some kind of condition or sickness
That inhibits my ability to fit in with hip kids
Sit and sip drinks without feeling ridiculous
Is there something I've missed, is this all just a trick?
Can you all just admit that you're being pricks
For shits and giggles? It itches and niggles
This list of questions, riddles and things
That fill my head and inner sense with visions of maliciousness
With this malevolence I'm stripped of my innocence
The pinnacle thing beginning my wishlist's
A vision in which I'm just hindered with less stress
So if I sink into and addiction and alcoholism
Can I be forgiven for wishing to skip this
Abyss of decisions? This piteous pit
Full of pissy and shit citizens
Cos if this planet I've seen's the epitome of existence
Then shit, you can literally sit and spin on it

I'm a misfit - I'm not an alpha male
Misfit - my health's too frail
I'm a misfit - worn out and pale
Misfit - I'm bound to fail
I'm a misfit - your inane conversation
Misfit - puts a strain on my patience
I'm a misfit - please take me away from all
Misfit - this pain and frustration
Cos if this planet I've seen's the epitome of existence
Then shit, you can literally sit and spin on it




 This is for my cousin Alex
Yeah
Yo, I'm John "Soap" MacTavish
Done loads of damage with my gun
Blown up baddies
And then totally vanished
So keep your eyes peeled
And your lips tight sealed
Or you might feel
The might of my riot sheild
Forget Battlefield
And feck the Batmobile
You might as well be playing blackjack
Or Track & Field
Dragon slaying's aggrivating
And it lacks appeal
Button bashing
Cutting, slashing
Nothing that is real
I've got the knack to wield
A plethora of weapons
Level up again
Collect the set
And come for seconds
I'll kick your RSASS with an MP7
Then I'll kick your arse
(ass)
Send you to the heavens
Yes, I'm quite divine with a Type 95
Ha!
I bet you couldn't even type "95"
I'm not pulling your leg
I'm putting you to bed
With a bullet in your head
So goodbye, nighty night :)

Ayo I'm dropping tons of songs
In Cluster bombs
A Tuff Gong
So If I'm not your #1
Then there's something wrong
Suck your mom
I've done a ton of run and gun
You've done a runner, son
I run amok amongst these other
Motherfucking chumps
I'm a son of a gun
You're the son of your mum
There's not another that's as good
Under the sun
I'm
More than the sum of my parts
Pull you apart for fun
I'll serve a server full of nerds
As I'm the hardest one
Between you and me
I'm a UMP
You're a pea shooter
Doing stupid to a T
I'm sure Yuri can do a free beautifully
And Captain Price's tracks are nice
But they lack the
Fanatical
Tactical
Flashy
Grammatical
Radical
Classical
Stats
To satisfy my appetite
If any prat'll mess with me
Then he dies
So blast this MP3
Like an MP5

You don't need a statistician
To see I smack the rhythm
With a degree of accuracy
That's needed for atom splitting
That's precision
When I'm rapping about matter, fission
Having a laugh with physics
And still bringing cracking lyrics
To challenge MacTavish to a battle
Is a bad decision
Masochism
I'll kick your ass on any map you pick
And have you wishing that you didn't
Little lad, you lack the jism
To come back and tackle Britain
And in fact this is an actual acquisition
Of Activision's rap division
And Daniel's mission
Is to kick the ass of competition
I'm a handy mix of Andy McNab and Biggie
And when I smoke a fag
I don't mean that I have a ciggie
Sorry for the homophobic slang
But that's what happens
Idiots'll thrown a frag
And blow up faster
Than my rapping videos
Although I love kittens
I'm a great softie
But don't tell anybody
Stay frosty




 Me? I rap about games!
(Yeah, we've gathered that by now)
Who said I can't rap about board games, bro
(Somebody, presumably)
Keepin' it old school, innit bro?
(Yes it is)
Check it!
(Ch-check it...)

I'm not a property magnate
I'm a property magnet
Your offers, I'm knocking them back quick
As if I'm popping a tablet
Not stopping 'til I've got in the last bid
I splash quids side to side like my ad libs
Damn rich! Made of bread like a sandwich
Six figure plus cash sums are my language
Turning every opportunity to my advantage
So I can afford anything I've ever fancied
Shh! Here's an advanced tip to fill up your bank quick
Buy everything you fricking can while you're in transit
Take out the other gangs quick, bloods and crips
Make their bank balance even tighter than your hand grips
Fingers clamp tipped like a titanium vice when I'm shaking the dice
You didn't take my advice and I'm not saying it twice
Alright, I'm saying it twice
I'm bankrupting you so say your goodbyes
Uhh
Do not pass Go
And do not collect $200

I'm a cataclysm of capitalism
Stacking the dividends as I rap on the rhythm
I'm lacking humility, never lacking in income
This isn't a city, it's a kingdom
I got dat Monopoly money
You're not going to take my property from me
I got dat Monopoly money
You're not going to take my property from me

I'm not going to lie; the Monopoly guy
Looks impossibly fly in a top hat, moustache and a tie
I properly rock at Monopoly
You're probably not going to topple me
Even if your house burned down it wouldn't be hot property
Got money on my mind, I might require a lobotomy
I'm all about the green and I'm not discussing botany
But ruck with me and I might need to lick some broccoli
You're economically unsound like an art degree
My pocket's deep enough to feed everyone sleeping rough
But you don't beat the competition treating poverty
I'm really sorry that there's people that aren't eating properly
I acknowledge it's a problem, but not for me
What, you really think I'd know how to play fair?
When I was raised in a hotel on Mayfair?
I'd prefer to stay here, you can stay there
But as you're passing by, you'd better pay the fare

I'm a cataclysm of capitalism
Stacking the dividends as I rap on the rhythm
I'm lacking humility, never lacking in income
This isn't a city, it's a kingdom
Monopoly. Hot property
I am Dan Bull and I rock a beat
Monopoly. Hot property
I am Dan Bull and I rock a beat

Has anyone ever actually finished a Monopoly game
Without overturning the board and throwing little buildings everywhere?
Not me... Not me
Consoles? You're next




 (Culling in the name of)
Culling in the name of
(Culling in the name of)
Culling in the name of
(Culling in the name of)

I'm the monster hunter
The one that wants to punch you
So hard your lungs are punctured
'Til you're just a stumbling drunkard
Interrupting your luncheon
Rupture the structure
Of your bodily functions
No dungeons here
Au contraire
We're in the open air
Making sure the coast is clear
Toasting them like toast from bread
Never mind having a open mind
I'll give you an open head
Like hitting post malone with a blow that has broke every bone
You're stony dead
It'll be a long day of slaying monsters
Before i go home to bed

When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster?
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
Culling in the name of

Smashing up an ecosystem in the name of research
Leaving no stone unturned
Collecting the achievements
I don't like variety and biodiversity
Banned from every animal sanctuary
Just 'cause I did a murder spree
Got kicked out of the hunter's guild
'Cause I lost count of the monsters killed
But still when it comes to spelling skins off things
No one's as skilled
We may well end up obliterated
Because these fellows are sophisticated
So unless you wish to end up in a vegetative state
We'd better be quick
Better get creative
Now I know I'm not a native
I'm a mammal that's invasive
And I'm coming face to face with another one of God's creations
An ominous abomination
And one of us is going to slay shit
Displace him
And then display his place in nature's chain of domination
And I'm no uncommon basic bully, look making no accommodation
Fully booked
Coming at you like a bloody truck
With the force of this forthcoming hook:

When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster?
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
Cullin in the name of
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Which one of us is the real monster?
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Which one of us is the real monster?

I'm sending out the scout flies:
Now guys
Go and help find me a nobel prize
That's about the size of a house in Dubai
I tell him to jump
They Replay "how high"
How could I not be out my mind
When I'm never knowing whether I'm about to die
Between the jaws in the maw of a mouth
Incisors
Coming down like a bout of menningitis
Si I live fast, die hard
Shout and cry this:
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Yes
Nicked that line from an eminem track
That's a rhyme that he'll never get back
Anyone who wants it can come and get ir
Like it's KSI's belt or a bit of negative feedback
See that?
When I lurk in the shruberry
They're unaware of their forthcoming buggery
Mother nature made something ugly
I look at them the same way they look at me
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Which one of us is the real monster?

When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster?
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
(Culling in the name of)




 A CD won't get me a mortgage
That's because you pricks haven't bought it
Five pound and you couldn't affort it?
Just cocked the download and ignored it?
I believe in  as much
As I believe OJ Simpson was innocent
 of a geek
 whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
I'm going to the mountain, when I come back
I'll be ten times better, backpack on my back
Like I'm going 
I'm not going 
I'm going to the mountain
I'm going to the mountain, when I come back
I'll be ten times better, backpack on my back
Like I'm going 
I'm not going 
I'm going to the mountain

I'm going to the mountain again
'Cause I got atop, my last album impressed
The doubters again, and at this rate
It won't be out in 2010
So you can smile for a while
But know, when I'm back from the mountain
You're going to hear the sound of immense
 lyricist crowned as the best
For now I'm allowing the stress
Messing around, doing an impression
And sounding like Ghetts
Down on the best track to ever spin around in your decks
I'm bound to impress
With the  coming louder than jets
Going over your head to the mountain again

Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up

I ain't mastered my craft yet
But the more time in a mountain, the better the tracks get
Improvement's the key, what I do with the beats
Leave you with a completely snapped neck
I've  rapped, 'til I take my last breath
Whether or not I'm gettin' a fat cheque
I  with a black pen
Record, then you all, like: "Did you hear what Dan said?"
No metaphor
That man  Ghetts
And that takes some doing
I'm boiling up, the frustration brewing
And making you and your mates listen to it
It's amazing the way that I do it
I hate to ruin your fun
But you and your dumb crew aren't making a great improvement!
My CD won't get me a mortgage
That's because you pricks haven't bought it
Five pound and you couldn't affort it?
Just cocked the download and ignored it?
I believe in  as much
As I believe OJ Simpson was innocent
 of a geek
 whole scene's looking at me, but hold up

Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up

Elevation? Been there, done it
I've planted my flag at the summit
Stood astride the mountain
The tiger's grouching, now the dragon is coming
You  standing from nothin'
 is rubbish
I'm standing above at the foot of the mountain
I'm rambling up any fuckers

Look around, prick
You wanted somethin' that sounds sick, now you've found it
Ignorant listeners are gonna tell I've got it down to a 
Who's putting in a word
Like a sherpa  mountain, it's me




 I'll get in my submarine
Set sail to somewhere remote
I'll wait until World War III is over
Then go and live with the victors and
Sing
Sing
My catharsis
Look, never again will I put down my pen
The best method I know to let stuff out my head
Yes, I'm aware of the notion I must sound a bit dense
But I'm just letting you know there's nothing round to contend
When stressed then I focus on jotting down a lament
Introspectively composing what comes out from within
Whenever you feel hopeless, down, depressed
I suggest getting a note book out and venting
Whether wrecked or sober muck round with the text
Get depression focused, confront the doubt and dread
Instead of letting them roam or shutting them out your head
Don't ever repress emotions, push them down, pretending
You never noticed them sucking you down to death
You could suffer a thousand deaths together alone
Getting ever more low 'til you couldn't get up out of bed
So yes, my best weapon's prose, and I'll love sound to def
My catharsis
Sometimes you need to sit and vent your heart
Even if there's a fair chance some prick'll tear it apart
But I don't care, it's a farce
So I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve eager to share it with half
Of the people that care when I start with my speech
Harp through my teeth
About seemingly meaningless things mithering me
And I mean it's difficult to say what's really on your brain
Without thinking what friends think of your frame of mind
Cos they might think you're a little bit insane
But if you wanna break from the cycle of pain
Then you might wanna change up your mind and its frame
You're neither to blame nor liable for saying
Any lines on a page that's inscribed with your name
They're right when they say pen's mightier than sword
So remember that fact then write and record
My catharsis




 It's
It's
It's like I'm
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm here

My ship was wrecked
I hit the deck
And then I woke in a utopia of picturesqueness
Limp and breathless
But getting restless
I think events like this are sent to test us
The unplanned, the unreal, the unknown
The unsure, the unseen, the unshown
The uncanny that you cannot understand
Because it's unfathomably unimaginably unraveling
You're unconscious, unrolling, uncovering
The unspoiled and uncommon it's unfolding
You cannot undo it
But everything you undergo you're going to come through it
Through time and season released on an island retreat
With nothing but rhyme and reason
Shrines, idols and carved figurines
Will be debris when I give up what I believe in

As the sun goes down the moon comes out
And the same landscape seems new somehow
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme
As the sun goes down the moon comes out
And the same landscape seems new somehow
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme

I'm shipwrecked upon an island
Silent but for the echoes of a siren
It's wild what the perspective and the light does
My heads spinning it's really messing my mind up
Got to do something positive, so I'm running reconnaissance
Discovering phenomena beyond my cognisance
Ominous monoliths, not the commonest obelisks
Survive through time like honest promises and rise prominent
My hypothesis divine providence
Can I climb up to the summit, when I'm confident
To move free
Like the sand between my toes
Or the way that the wind blows
More power to me I wonder how it would be
To run around between the towers and the sea
Where the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees
And the great beasts lived in peace
Aston fields

As the sun goes down the moon comes out
And the same landscape seems new somehow
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme
As the sun goes down the moon comes out
And the same landscape seems new somehow
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme

First time (first time, time)
First rhyme (first rhyme)
First time (first time, time)
First rhyme (first rhyme)




 Just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
You know just master race things
Oi Mate !
Check out my new rig
Nine thousand and two gig...
Of games
With more mods than a who gig
I read the jealousy written on your face
When I said I needed planning permission for my case
Your rig is a disgrace
It's a little but a raised
Middle finger up to Gaben and an insult to the race
Every console falls prey to the same fate
Blatant aliasing and a lame frame rate
Hey mate
I measure mine in planck time
Beat you to the singularity defining mankind
Ahead of the times
You wouldn't even believe
I pre-order a release before it's event conceived
I've got such a cutting edge chipset
That I can only play games that don't even exist yet

You console peasants have facts to face
Facts to face
Facts to face
You can't compare to that master race
The master race will faq your face

I'm just letting you know there's no letters as sexy
As WASD
I've got an 8TB SSD
You've got an IDE running XP
Forget 1080p, that's a baby screen
Anything less than 8K will make me scream
If there's ever a pixel that I can plainly see
It best be on a retro indie game release
A nice fact for you to wank about
There's more cash in my steam wallet than in my bank account
Kids stay in school
Never break rules
And make sure you pray every day to Gabe Newell

I'm pro nuclear power
Cause I can drain a whole power plant with my PSU in an hour
The hoover dam's water cooling my tower
My CPU needs something new to devour
While you fool around with your montain dew
My watercooler's the fountain of youth
I don't give a damn about the review
My PC'S a beast
It should be held in a zoo
GPU fans sounds as loud as the who
Producing heat that's even capable of melting a nuke
I tell thee, it's true
And if you doubt me we'll do
A stress test where I'll leave you running round in a loop
You're a console peasant
I'm a grumpy old pedant
In a adolescent brain on the credit of my parents
I had them pay for my setup as a present
Cause I said I needed better processing for my lessons
What I meant was FPS in league of legends
And the set on LED keys on my desk are iridescent
Do I ever have a little bit of emphaty ? NO !
My our framerates be high and our temperatures low !

Get a better Nvidia, you fricking idiot
Your laggy jaggies are actually hideous
I want the smoothest skins, Nivea
For my Skyrim mod to get jiggy with Lydia
While we're waving digital dicks about
I've got more monitors than your pixel count
My Oculus Rift wears an Oculus Rift
With an Oculus Rift on its Oculus Rift

I've got an IMAX eye implant

 Ay
Look

Who's the man dropping the rap?
It's Ned Stark
I rule the land on top of the map
I got a head start, Bloodclart
I'm the Lord and Warden of the North
From the border to the wall I rule it all
Food for thought
And who'd have thought a King could bring a tune as raw
A regal troubador whose keep's a music hall
He speaks the truth on beats and proves to you he knew the lore
But I'm über-sure that's nothing you never knew before
I drop real lyrics
And that's a fact of life you might not feel but it's that I've got skill And this is why I rule the roads like tribes off hills
There was a guy I'd got to kill from the Night's Watch; Will
Hah, what a shite talker warning about White Walkers
Bedtime stories I ought to tell to my daughters
And regarding family matters: Family matters
Hassle my family and I'm having your knackers

So foes of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming
The enemies of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming

I'm handling thing with the standard I bring
Would you expect less from the Hand of the King
Who's cold enough to let Joffrey give Sansa the Ring, think?
My standing's as grand as young Bran on his legs
So I head to King's Landing demanding respect
Or there'll be payback like a Lannister's debt
Since Baratheon's passing, the palace bereft
Of a king 'til the crown is on Stannis' head
But then I take heed of what Varys had said
Revealing the reason why John Arryn is dead
Barriston and I began to suspect a plan
To defect that the Lannisters evidently ran in effect
Baratheon spoke aloud his last letter
And I accurately wrote it down to the last letter
Just miss a little bit out, now that's better
Keep Joffrey off the hotseat
The little pecker

Foes of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming
The enemies of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming

That letter from the High King was ripped up by the bitch herself
Despite the prison cell in which I dwell
I'm still the Lord of Winterfell
You're still a horde of infidels
So give me your support as king or else we'll storm the citadel
Flipping hell, this a tale I may not live to tell
'Cause one does not simply...
Wait, that was Rivendell
There isn't Elves in this story at all
And now I've gone and broke character, it's damaging the Fourth Wall
It happens when I'm dropping off the top of my head
Until my head is dropping off and I'm dead
You've been rocking with Ned
Probably the best to drop in all of Westeros
At least I guess I was until my head was lost

Foes of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming
The enemies of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming

Watch the throne




 I'm Neil Armstrong
I've got my garms on
Far-reaching as if each arms long
Planet Earth
Man, it's dead in this place
I look down on every race
When I'm in space
VIP invitation
So you can't come along
It's just me, Buzz
And that other one
We get in Apollo 11
And head to the heavens
In terms of transport
It's an irregular method
And telecoms are expensive
We haven't got a landline
That's one giant phone bill
For man kind

Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
I said, who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon

To all you faker haters:
I'd like to take away
The doubts you've got
Until you drop them
Like the hottest bake potato
Screw the rumors
That the moon is made of cheese
Or the whole space race campaign
Is make believe
Claiming there's no way
That we could have planned it
We could be leaving the planet
Without it leaving us stranded
So let me be blunt and candid
You eejits' are mad
And ain't even speaking my language
You're just mean and pedantic
Claiming that we were pretending
But I ain't even offended
So face it, space dick:
"The Eagle has landed"

Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
I said, Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
I said, Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon




 Enter the domain of the NerdCubed, videos dropping from above like bird poo
Your channel stinks, you need some perfume
And you should probably head to bed﻿ its past your curfew
But if gaming's the thing that falls within your purview
You'll find Dan to be a man of many virtues
There's so many issues to which he can alert you
While many commentators just say derp derp derp derp
Nerd cubed cubed cubed
Nerd cubed cubed cubed
Nerd cubed cubed cubed
See, he's the Dan whose second name is Hardcastle
And Im the Dan whose title defines a type of large cattle
Bully!
That particular game has been completed fully
And﻿ in the most interesting way never dully
See Bollywood have got it good but we taking over
Blowing up like shaking cola, vinegar and baking soda
We like procrastinating but who's complaining?
Its a new form of masterbating computer gaming
Enter the domain of the NerdCubed
Videos dropping from above like bird poo

 Hey, mister!
I understand you want to date my sister
Well, I'd rather see her with a hipster or a vagrant drifter
Take your blistered hands away you savage ape, resist her (right)
She needs a guy who plays Risk, not games of Twister

(Ah)
The animosity offered with no apology
Don't bite the hand that protects your freedom and democracy, bro
So check it out, 'cause I'm asking for some respect
You don't want to see what happens when I get upset
So come correct

Defeat me?
You don't have the brains to beat me
I'll sneak in and steal all your regions discreetly
I'm on the cutting edge of modern technology
You're the missing link in evolutionary biology (ah)

OK, I see you're a little upset, little Timmy
The world ain't fair and life is a little fibby
You better stand at attention if you trying to smack talk
Attack you like a Black Hawk and make you want to back off

In the future, battle will happen through computers
No boots on the ground or troops to be found
So where does that leave you, sir?
At the back of the queue with no notable skills
'Cause no employer's going to call you for your total kills
You're not even worth the phone call bills, while my own ability in coding more than makes up for my lack of social skills
I'm too busy planning to get out there yet (right)
One day my brain power's going to pay your welfare check

All praise General Mattis with the CHAOS
I got the VA, GI Bill, everything paid off
Traveled the world five times, you never left your basement
But that's who you become when you a nerdy kid gaming
Welcome to my world, small arms fire's a given
No kidding, I beat my enemies to submission
You wouldn't stand a chance even behind computers
I'm trained for cyberattacks so everything you do is useless

I'm practiced in strategy and tactics
You couldn't even find this planet with an atlas
I run circles around you with my pinky fingertips
You better call a medic 'cause this lyric's going to sting a bit

Medic! Medic!
Nobody here to save you
Call a Medevac but they're too busy for a player 2
You coming in broke and unreadable, maybe speak up
Ruck a mile in my boots, you wouldn't even keep up

I don't need to leave the house
I don't even leave the couch
I can eat pizza and stream TV with my keyboard and mouse
Anyone can dress up like Vin Diesel and shout
Fix your posture, soldier, you're beginning to slouch
But can you think strategically?
Make a million quick decisions immediately?
These superior brain cells deal with it easily (eh-heh)
See the map from high above, my whole perspective risen
Unlike you I don't follow orders - I give them

Knife hands so sharp, better move out the way
My group so tight I get expert for days
M4 50 cal, boy you better step up
Skull drag you all over this house so you never get up
I'm a trained professional, so what do I call this?
I'm the bicep to freedom, and you're the armpit
Fair warning, I'm coming to conquer all
The nerds are about to fall and I'm yelling Geronimo (geronimo)

So you've got a girlfriend, big deal
I can hug my body pillow while my mom brings meals
But can you occupy a territory or make alliances
How can you research weapons, you don't even know what science is
Winning takes diplomacy, experience and vision
And my intuition says you're lacking in precision
So what you could beat me in the physical domain
While you're out I'll sit and take your city in the game
So you'll be out fighting wars while I'm writing treaties
But I'm not even sure if we're the same species
You're all brawn and no brains
GI Joe with a strong chest
I'm already legendary
Immortal Conquest

You deal microtransactions with fast satisfaction
I'm smashing your faction with pinpointed action
My cavalry, infantry, archers and mages are led by the gods from all of the ages
I'll sweep down upon you from high in the sky
You're way too late, nerd, I'm taking Delphi

You think this is game over?
I say no sir!
I'll take over your Humvee with my Range Rover
While you're out celebrating
I'll be here delegating
Planning, deliberating, conquering and elevating
My armies are in motion and you're barely out the door
I let you win the battle
So I could win the war




 The world wide web is under attack
They’re taking it away but we’re pulling it back
The world wide web is under attack
They’re taking it away but we’re pulling it back

So the FCC won’t let me be
They wanna stack the deck for the ISPs
But we got a couple of tricks up our sleeves
It’s far too important to leave to police
It could lead to the streets
A breach of the peace
And even decrease our freedom of speech
There’s never been a bigger reason to read up
And see what’s agreed ‘cause of greed for the green and deceit
The greener the leaf, the sweeter the tree
The quicker they’ll chop it down and leave nothing but tree stumps
Debris
The Damage is done, no refund received
See, the thing about net neutrality
Is unless you get huge salaries
The paramedic won’t rescue casualties
‘Til they've seen to the rich next dude’s allergies
They’ll prioritize cash over content
Wanna send one bit? That’s one sent
What nonsense, man it’s scaring me
A planet of plenty’s selling scarcity
Innovation paved the way
Now invaders are paying to take it away
But they ain't gonna make it today
Letting that happen’s a major mistake
If Lessig was rapping he’d tell you the same
Letting that happen’s a major mistake
Tim Berners Lee baked us a cake
And they've taken the cherry AND THE CAKE!!!
Discrimination is happening today
To blacks and to gays and to packets of data
Though ethically they’re exactly the same
So oi, we’re not gonna stand for it mate
U wot?
The fok u sayin bruv?
U wot m8???
The fok u saying bruv?
U wot?
Fak off u arsehole

The world wide web is under attack

I’m from the place John Oliver came from
Where no matter where you live you should be singing the same song
At long last, I’m putting Comcast on blast
‘Cause they never learned their lesson like they’re in the wrong class
Well I’m the professor and I’m setting you with one task
Get ‘em knocked back like a shot glass
Straight in front of me’s a cable company
The way they’re behaving’s unbelievable
Comcast is in league with the Devil
And it’s pissing me off, I’m not even American
Take a peek, see from the evidence
Netflix had to pay a fee to get better links
It’s a shakedown, communication breakdown
There’s a bully in the playground
I had enough of that at school, won’t lay down
Lay a finger on me: you’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
Lay a finger on me: You’ll be laid out

The world wide web is under attack
They’re taking it away but we’re pulling it back
The world wide web is under attack
They’re taking it away but we’re pulling it back
Taking it back, taking it back
We’re taking it, we’re taking it back




 I have found a way out
I have found a way out
It's a dark and desolate path
It will take everything that I've got
But I have found a way out
I have found a way out

Daniel
Oh Daniel Bull
You are such an awkward boy
Why do you do it
Daniel
Oh Daniel Bull
You might be the death of me
But I love you

I put my life on the line, didn't I?
I pegged it up for prying eyes
It was a fresh CD
A clean sheet leaves me high and dry
But try as I might
I can't find the fight to retire, no
So it's time that I livened up
Took a stride to the light and strut

I got a clean new opportunity
To produce CD two beautifully
Would you believe I'm in a super-human league
I mean, who else can do what I do to beats musically?
As soon as D.A.N. B.U.L.L. spells trouble
Then you can leave
Meanwhile please stay glued to your seats
So you can see the ace up my new sleeve

I didn't decide to pick up a biro, no
Didn't decide to pick up a microphone
Woe betide my open eyes
So I've opened my soul, and lo and behold
Ive broken the mould
Try as I might
I can't find the fight to retire, no
So it's time that I livened up
Took the mic and said "hiya chuck"

If I was a peg (which I'm not)
I'd hold you
But I have found a way out
I have found a way out




 I'm not a player, I just suck a lot
I couldn't give a shucking fit whether we win the cup or not
In real life I can't even kick it
I've never been to a match, let alone bought a season ticket
There's no denying my skill though
I can dribble all over my pillow
I can't do a scissor kick, but I can kick scissors
And sue whoever manufactured them for six figures
I'm a man on a mission with ambition
To be the sickest soccer kickist in my position
At school I liked playing defender a bit
'Cause I could have a chit chat down the end of the pitch
With my friend who was shit, we used to collect stickers
But we'd get suspicious even at the scent of a kit
But now I want to make it in the premiership
If you don't have faith I will, it'll offend me, you prick
I'm the son of a bitch that'll run on the pitch
So awkward you'll think that were was some kind of glitch
And within a couple of minutes I'll have stitch
I don't want to put the effort in, I just want to be rich
I'm the son of a bitch that'll run on the pitch
So awkward you'll think that were was some kind of glitch
And within a couple of minutes I'll have stitch
I don't want to put the effort in, I just want to be rich

I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot (hah, huh)
I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot (ah, oi)
I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot (heyey!)
I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot (yeah, ey)

I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot
I tripped over my laces and nearly grazed my knuckle off
I can't even recall a time my side won
My keepy uppy record is like none
By gum, my chum, why try when I
Can just hide inside sat on my bum?
Twiddle my thumbs on the Joypad, I'd enjoy that
Taped over the final to annoy Dad
So call the boy bad, I call it fair play
I'm not a good sport or good at sport, I'm bare bait
Stuck kicking a snare across the airwaves
Better at rap than football, I dare say
Though get in the way of my goal and get battered
Your reputation wrecked, tattered
Sepp Blatter
I'm a professional athlete, 'cept fatter
You'll never get me to a track meet, I'm already knackered
(Yeah)

I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot (hah, huh)
I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot (ah, oi)
I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot (heyey!)
I'm not a player 'cause I suck a lot (yeah, ey)




 I'm not the kind of guy that you would likely see
Criticising anybody, unless I believed
That they deserve to be told I disagree
With something that they've done specifically
Now I'm alright with some types of piracy
But not the violent type you find on the high seas
Why fight your allies in times of peace
Then hide behind a pile of lies like you were trying to police?
So it's okay for you to go crazily
Overboard with excessive use of force?
Though sticks and stones may break your bones
They don't provoke a massacre with no remorse
But never mind that, don't give it another thought
'Cause provididing aid's clearly an act of war
You should do anything, no matter how debauched
To stop support from ever getting to your ports

I knew a Jewish girl, and she was a pearl
What I'm trying to say is that I've got no hatred
I've got nothing on Jews, baby
(no, no, no, nothing wrong with jews)
(no, nothing wrong with jews)
This is aimed at The Jewish State, yeah
(no, no, no, nothing wrong with jews)
(no, nothing wrong with jews)

It's like I have witnessed Zionism's Rennaissance
You and your mates in the States really get along
They veto anything that doesn't let you get what you want
Even if it's sending planes to bomb Lebanon
Or a naval blockade dawn raid with every weapon drawn
Treating aid workers as agents of Hezbollah
Your reputation is tainted for evermore
Stop... have a think about it
You've attacked Lebanon, you've attacked Egypt
Even to Syria you're dealing blows
You've attacked Jordan, you've had a war with
Every bordering country I know
British Israeli relations are so low
So I hope I don't become another Shlomo
This song's never going to win a MOBO
Even though I flow like the oil to the shores of the Gulf coast
Or the blood in the waters of your coast

I knew a Jewish girl, and she was a pearl
What I'm trying to say is that I've got no hatred
I've got nothing on Jews, baby
(No, no, no, nothing wrong with jews)
(no, nothing wrong with jews)
This is aimed at The Jewish State, yeah
(no, no, no, nothing wrong with jews)
(no, nothing wrong with jews)

To Zion, to Zion
To Zion, to Zion
To Zion, to Zion
To Zion, to Zion




 Well
Why are video games so bloody violent?
Mindless?
Man, it's time to rewind
To a time where the action was colorful and innocent
Moms and Dads didn't have to be diligent
Didn't have to panic for the kids becoming militant
Mario's back and it's brilliant!
I'm a wholesome character that is suitable for children
A real role model when I'm leaping off a building
Come on kids; follow me, follow me
One, two, three; jump off and weeeeee!
Dash through traffic shouting "tally ho"
Can you run down the road as fast as Mario?
I'ma show you pipes; a variety of types
Hash pipes, crack pipes; pass me a light
I'm jacked up on mushrooms, listening to Rush tunes
Puff, puff, pass me the carrot
Motherfuck you

Fuck. Yeah
(Oh no Mario!)
Fuck. Yeah
(Oh no Mario!)
(Fucking listen)

Roll up to the club and I jump on the table
Engage in R-rated behavior that's shameful
Fuck the haters straight up mate
You can jump on a turtle, and make it painful
I'm only saving Princess Peach
To get a piece and pinch her peaches
Preach!
I'm going to break that bum when I get her home
But I've got the shakes man, I'm coming off the methadone
So I scoff another plate full of Goombas
Make her suck me off on the rug like a roomba
Ooh-rah
Rebel rabble rouser
That'll yank down Bowser's trousers
And I sell drugs, plumbing is a front
I'm addressing every woman as a cunt
Roughing up a punk while I'm puffing on a blunt
Duppy motherfuckers and I stuff them in the trunk

Fuck finishers in Mortal Kombat
(Oh no Mario!)
Mario's already been there, done that
(Oh no Mario!)
Fuck Carmageddon and fuck Manhunt
(Oh no Mario!)
Mario's worse, he's a god damn cunt
(Oh no Mario!)

Spin my hat front to back then back to front
I bet you can't do that, you cunt
I'm a little fucking fat fucking plumber
Fucking taking on fucking any fucking comer
I'm a
Loose cannon on the loose
With an appetite for animal abuse
Don't like Jews, I don't like you
Don't like anybody, hang them from a noose
Enacting atrocities, cruelty of all kinds
Bloodbaths, massacres, slaughter, and war crimes
Napalming your jungle leaves
When I'm shaking the junk in my dungarees
But you won't get a crumb from me
Because I'm from the streets of New Donk City
Out the barrio and I'm heading for Hell
It's a me Mario beheading infidels

Fuck Saints Row, fuck Grand Theft Auto
(Oh no Mario!)
Mario's going to come and cut your throat
(Oh no Mario!)
Fuck Doom, fuck Hatred
(Oh no Mario!)
Mario's raping all that is sacred
(Oh no Mario!)

(Nintendo; Fun for all the family)




 More syncopated drumming. I believe they call it boom-bap. It's an onomatopoeic term to describe the sound of the kick and the snare. Ideally, the kick should be like a punch to the stomach. And the snare a slap to the face. One love, and I don't mean tennis

I was gonna write a letter to my friend in prison
Till I remembered that I haven't got a friend in prison
Most of my associates are well to do professionals
They probably don't need to spend much time in a confessional
I'll tell you what though, I better shout out Peterson  they're keeping under
Julian Assange holed up in the embassy
And doing his hardest to prevent himself being sent to Sweden
I've got a question and I'm not expecting answers
But how come prison is for everyone except for bankers
The feckless, reckless wankers who's only focus is bogusness
And they still manage to go home with a bonus, bruv
That sets examples for the rest of us
Cos if they're not arresting them then why the heck are they arresting us?
It's double standards, they're too big to fail
Too big for handcuffs and too big for jail
I believe the judges should never give sentences
Until they've spent a bit of time in penitentiaries
I feel relieved that despite my petty crimes
I've never had to spend a single second doing time

One love
One love
One love
One love

I see keeping animals caged as outrageous
Just to expand the range of flavours upon our plate disgust me
I feel I must free my suffering sisters and brothers
Who I trust treat it as no more than just meat
Are resourced by the same people who are outraged to eat horse
You're either seated on a wobbly moral see-saw
Or you've simply never thought about it before
Now I'm getting preachy, but getting preachy's easy
When you see diseased creatures treated as a piece of meat
Which is obviously what they are, GG
But so am I, does that mean that you would eat me?
Cos if you would then you're a cannibal
But if you wouldn't then you're racist against animals
And it's you that battery farming is actually harming
Have you seen what happens? It's alarming
Trapped animals bred and pumped with chemicals
And fed their dead family instead of vegetables
These are the graveyards where husbandry is dead to all
And yet it's where your dinner comes from, it's dreadful
I'm energised and angry now, better call me Red Bull
But if I cared any less I'd be neglectful
Yeah I'm a fluffy bunny lover, you funny bugger
I'm fucking proud of my compassions for others

One love
One love
One love
One love

There's different kinds of prison, those that people doing time would live in
Then there's the ones inside your mind that keep you hiding, quivering
Poverty's a prison and it's getting bigger
It's becoming tougher for the kids, look it up and check the figures
A silent seeker's bundled up inside a secret bunker
Where they are deprived of each other and the people they love and live for
No if's, or's, and but's, freedom's at full capacity the frickin doors are shut
I used to believe in capitol punishment till I saw
What the difference between getting someone back and justice is
You need to be able to reverse an unjust decision
Because the justice system doesn't have enough precision
There's false accusations, human error, prejudice
Corruption in the courts, we ought to put an end to this
Who? Me? I'm scared of jury duty
If I send the wrong one down someone'd surely shoot me
That just wouldn't work, I'd rather be sat on my booty
Watching 12 Angry Men, I'm turning classic movies
Reality scares me, till insanity dares me
To get mad and grab my pen and pad and rap on a rare beat
I see so many injustices I haven't much to give to them
In terms of giving just a single fuck for it, I must forgive myself
I'm only human, doing what I should to keep my mind open and tune in
Consumerism is so massively distracting
I'll battle the allure of apathy in action
I'm gonna have to beat it bad some so I can concentrate
On debates, important issues, and what's going on today
There's so much on my plate domestically
And yet it seems I'll never let the mundane get the best of me
Today is just another day I get to bless the beat
Yeah, today is just another day I get to bless the beat
One love

One love
One love
One love
One love

For everyone who wants love
This is for everyone who wants love
(To all my niggas locked up, for Queens Branch)
It's also for Vladimir Putin, who appears to want, rather than love, global domination
Whatever floats your nuclear submarine, Vlad. One love




 Heeelllo!
So, alot of people want to know what "m.c." stands for
"Is it, uh, 'microphone controller?'"
Nope
"Is it 'Master of Ceremony?'"
Nope certainlly not
It's MINECRAFT!
And I am Dan Bull

I've got to admit
I rather like playing MINECRAFT
Even though the graphic style's
Older than an iron bath
Creative's great but on survival
I am crap
It's like the beginning of oblivion
With the giant rats
Swinging my fists around
And all I hit's the ground
This shit's tricky
And I'm not spitting about the bristol sound
Wish I could be whipping out
A pixelated pistol
POW
Pigman down
Now let's hit the town
Before I got this game I promise you
I did go out
But I've given it up for bricks
I'm clinically addicted now
I need my fix
Or else I'll never leave my little house
Until I make it bigger
When my finger simply clicks the mouse
It fills me with a sensation of power
That's why I'm building me a sensational tower
To compensate for the shame
When I gaze down in the shower
I've played for hours
I need to wee, so later
I'll have to change my trousers

Just one more block
And I swear I'll stop (swear I'll stop)
Just one more block and I'll stop (shush)

Never mind beta blockers
I'm playing beta
And the blocks keep dropping
Like SEGA's stocks lately
Watch:
I'm taking mobs down
Like a crazy cop
It'll take a hand amputation
To make me stop
Go figure
My axe and crafting table made me lots
Gold digger
Better than Kanye and Jamie Foxx
Behaving like an 80's b-boy:
Breaking rocks
Remaking the museum of buildings
At Avoncroft
It's like a Lego set
With infinite bricks
And no chance of your vaccum cleaner
Picking up the bits
When I feel Philosophical
I sit and look at it
And think I'd rather dig
Than touch Venessa Hudgens' tits
It's
Like a game of Jenga
Without your friends beside
And there's a side
I'm quite eager to emphisise
Of course it's a geeky venture
Are you then surprised
Someone made a life-size model
Of the enterprise?
I went and tried that myself
But I got bored quick
Although I still managed to replicate
The Borg ship
And all it took
Was one brick
And one click
I know what you're thinking
No need to say it:
I'm sick


"Oh my God
You play MINECRAFT?
You're such a square"
"Yeah, I like MINECRAFT
It's positively delicious
Dan Bull
Do you dig?
I do."




 In ancient days
There was no day-to-day travel on trains;
No national railway
By the time of the 1800s
When the mines provided for Great Britain's hunger for energy
They had to come up with a method
To get stuff directly to where it was meant to be
So they designed lines to provide the mines
In Tyneside with many connections effectively
Then, inevitably, many men and MPs
Objected to these developments heavily
They rejected the perception that the step was needed
As they believed that ten was a deadly speed
But by the end of the century
There were three hundred tracks just in that forementioned region
Nevertheless, it was never easy
To set up shop and steam ahead of the rest
Many moneyed men would never invest
Unless it was tested and already a success
Then there were the farmers - alarmed by the smoke
Choked with no knowing whether it would harm us
Even the elite were keen to stop shunting
Merely as it interfered with fox hunting
Canal companies grumpily acknowledged
That their monopoly had come to be abolished
Try and fail, the sheen and polish
Of these iron rails could never be demolished
It was time tables were turned to deepen wallets
So the first train was timetabled with people on it;
And since the days of James Watt
They've got increasingly prominent
Yeah - trainspotters may seem a strange lot
But they've got a whole heap of knowledge. Listen:

In the year 1758 Parliament first allowed a rig for trains
1767 - Iron rails in Coalbrookdale were fixed together
1781 - A productive year - James Watt pioneered the sun and gear
In 1803 the Surrey Iron Railway opened publicly




 Even the softest step
Leaves footprints in the sand
Whether you hold coin
Or blade
Or bow within your hand
Even the lightest touch
Leaves traces in the dust
When coins are spent
Bows are broken
Blades decayed to rust

I write my lyrics out in lines of hieroglyphics
At about a mile a minute
Never mind the vile and wicked
Violent images, it might elicit
I defy the cynics' diatribes and missives
Swimming in the Nile and give a smiling crocodile a grimace
For those who might have missed it
My mind is mystic
Like my life is mythic
So don't you try to shift it
I'm a highly gifted kind of misfit
The sands of time slide aside the pyramids
In a manner that's quite unscientific
I take a large obelisk or the hard top of a sarcophagus
And stick it in a hippapotamus' oesophagus as if it's bottomless
I can't stop it, it's hopeless armed like an octopus
Hopping off of the top of an acropolis
Popping off above Ptolemy's populace
With a bronze khopesh and a lot of guts
Plus tell you what I'll just
Posthumously drop you off at the necropolis
Say ta for the lift
Cleopatra's a goddess, a prophetess
Don't even need to ask what the profit is
She's backed up with actual providence

Even the softest step
Leaves footprints in the sand
Whether you hold coin
Or blade
Or bow within your hand
Even the lightest touch
Leaves traces in the dust
When coins are spent
Bows are broken
Blades decayed to rust

It all starts with one
A single grain of gold
Finally fed up of living every day with pain untold
'Til every woman, every child, every man
Is a grain of sand sliding through the cracks in the pharoah's hand
Here I live amid the pyramids
Appearing in a vision, spirited
And near enough as soon as I've seen a rib
I stuck a spear in it
It is intimate
It's been a minute
Since I cut a ligament of an innocent
An uninhibited, illegitimate
Son of the rhythm and instruments
Maybe it's grandiloquent
To say I haven't equivalents
But stringing up such intricate linguistics
Is a stimulant
That'll open my iris
And I'm hoping Osiris finds us
The brotherhood is born, we leave our other form behind us
Julius Caesar truly is eager
To zoom in and be the nubian leader
Maybe he's doomed to achieve it
A new Egypt soon'll be breathing
A few more tombs to explore really deep in
Tutankhamun's seen that you're thieving
You're impeding hes sleep, little heathen
So there better be a really good reason
Whereas we never need sleep
Cyrene's serene enough for us
Every leader succumbs
Even queen Nefertiti's head becomes a bust
Whereas we never need sleep
Cyrene's serene enough for us
There's a deep heat
Sending each and every piece of dust to dust

Even the softest step
Leaves footprints in the sand
Whether you hold coin
Or blade
Or bow within your hand
Even the lightest touch
Leaves traces in the dust
When coins are spent
Bows are broken
Blades decayed to rust




 Orisa oh
Orisa go
(Oh)

Orisa oh
Stand your ground
Now Orisa go
Pull their defences down
Orisa oh
Watch over the team
Now Orisa hold
Us together in victory

Listen to me, sir, there's a new individual feature
On the scene that's pleased to meet you
Greet Orisa
She treats you like a piece of meat
On greasy pizza
I don't mean she feeds you, she eats you
And leaves the left over pieces in the freezer
You're frozen in the spot, call it immediate anaesthesia
Controlling gravity to make you halt, stay
Throwing ammo in your face as casually as Salt Bae
A babe aged but a month that does it the old way
She holds you in place before you're fucked, call it foreplay
Practicing safe sex, she brought a protective barrier
Being beat is a disease and you're the carrier
She's a tank that leaves you anchored, you wanker
You'll need to flank her for any chance to outrank her
How long will it need for you finally to learn
Leaving you burned is her primary concern

Orisa oh (wa-oh)
Stand your ground
Now Orisa go (now go)
Pull their defences down
Orisa oh (Orisa)
Watch over the team (Orisa)
Now Orisa hold (Orisa)
Us together in victory

With the gun on her waist she'll blow your blooming face off
Then drop her drum in your base, call it a drum and bass drop
M8 wot, she's got this game locked
It's too late to stop, rage quit and blame a frame rate drop
You ought to be sure not to ignore the order to halt
Or she'll pull you forward with the force of a horns of a bull
A portable fortress of awesomeness
Brought in to cause an unfortunate fall
With the force of a fork lift truck
That's falling off a waterfall and crushing all your balls to mush
So if you know what's good for you then you ought to shush
She'll take on stampedes the size of a pre-order rush
She'll impede and then stamp on each and all of us
Nothing breaches through when losers shoot her armour
Because it's amusingly futuristic as Futurama
Fortify, halt, fusion driver, supercharger
She looks rather like a bull, I wonder who's the father

Orisa oh (wa-oh)
Stand your ground
Now Orisa go (now go)
Pull their defences down (da-down)
Orisa oh (Orisa)
Watch over the team (Orisa)
Now Orisa hold (Orisa)
Us together in victory
(Orisa)




 May I be allowed to voice my opinion to you
Today I feel like I made a choice
And now there's no turning back

Isn't it great when you're a failure in life
And all that you've aimed for's gone away from your sights
Whilst your top eight mates are plain sailing through life
It's grey when you're bright but unable to quite
Make it through the day without evading the strife
I stay awake through the nights, lay in wait for the light
Brain vacant despite the debates in my mind
Like maybe my plane may have strayed from its flight
Failed to pervade and faded from the sky
Dan Bull's a candle with no flame to ignite
It's painful to write, I strain just to type
A page full of lines and I've drained all my pride
Eyes dry, I'm unable to cry
Time flies and I trail behind
You may say it's my fault, maybe you're right
Maybe it's myself to blame for my plight

I overdose and close my eyes
'Til I'm comatose and slowly rise
Over rows of roads and signs
Flows, tides froze in time
From lows to highs until there's only skies
No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies
No disguise, the skies are open wide
It goes as no surprise
No surprises, no alarms
No-one cries, I'm going calmly

I'm dazed, I seem to spend my days in a daydream
I've been this way way before the day I was eighteen
Haters say to me I waste the space to breathe
Wait for the train to Leeds with my claims in my case and leave
Please, believe me, I'd say I agree
Let them eat cake? I'll take it and eat it
Jeez, even taking a beating's a great deal easier
Than waking up each day in a place full of fears
And praying for amnesia with a faceful of tears
The pain's so severe that it aches and it sears
Peel away the veneer, the real state's revealed
I've been patient for years, just waiting to hear
Someone say that it's OK, that I'm safe cos they're here
But it's blatantly clear that that day's nowhere near
I hate to tempt fate but I'd be grateful for either
The faith of a believer or to fade away and disappear

I overdose and close my eyes
'Til I'm comatose and slowly rise
Over rows of roads and signs
Flows, tides froze in time
From lows to highs until there's only skies
No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies
No disguise, the skies are open wide
It goes as no surprise
No surprises, no alarms
No-one cries, I'm going calmly

So I'm closing my curtains and making my bed
Cos no-one on earth knows the pain in my head
No-one knows of the hurt or the strain or the dread
Though I'm over the worst I can't face things ahead
I'm escaping instead, I'm leaving this place
Erasing my thread and I'm cleaning my slate
Safe now I've fled, serene and sedate
There's no waking the dead when they beam into space
I've seen into space, shaken hands with the stars
And the feeling's great when you're landing on Mars
Dreamy and weightless in ambient dark
Only hearing the sweetness of transient harps
With my hand on my heart I assure you it's bliss
Soaring back to the starkness before you existed
Before you were born, before you were kissed
Before you were torn from the immortal abyss

I overdose and close my eyes
'Til I'm comatose and slowly rise
Over rows of roads and signs
Flows, tides froze in time
From lows to highs until there's only skies
No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies
No disguise, the skies are open wide
It goes as no surprise
No surprises, no alarms
No-one cries, I'm going calmly

I'm at the last act
No now amount of dark can harm me




 Oh
Watch over me
While you choose
Who you're going to be
Oh
Watch over me
While you show
The globe what you're going to be

Ha
You're here for heroes
With no distraction
So don't wait, hit quick play
And get straight to the action
It's Bastion
Blasting baskets of bullets at factions
The turret look's back and in fashion
Reinhardt'll ride hard as a hammer on a stallion
Chivalry's alive but he's not asking if he can marry you
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
Zarya singing an aria
Bringing a cannon
And flinging a barrier
Strong as a mountain
Benching a thousand pounds
So bound to be able to carry you
No matter whatever you are
It's rare that you're really as hard
As a gorilla in armour
We'll win in an instant
When Winston's bananas
Wince and witness Zenyatta send out an orb
Of harmony, destruction, or discord
Forged in the core of war, it's Torbjörn
Watch him erect a new form of dwarf porn
Here's a fun fact
Out in the Outback, Junkrat
Tick tock boomed and kaboomed
Like the kick on this drumtrack
Then when you reckon this rap's run amok
I pull a Roadhog
And drag you right back with the hook

Oh
Watch over me
While you choose
Who you're going to be
Oh
Watch over me
While you show
The globe what you're going to be

Reaper sweeps through the ether while death blossoms
Shadow step and spank
Leave you with a red bottom
McCree's Peacekeeper seeks any head honcho
Put a bullet through their head
Like a head through a poncho
It's high noon
Better ride soon if we're to reach Korea
GG fever
See D.Va's mech wreak, wreck, then eject careers
Irrespective what a reflection's trajectory is
Symmetra projects technicolor retinal tears and tears
If you're feeling hurty
Get a heal off Mercy
The hippocratic pacifist
A fit bird, literally
We've heard music only makes existence richer
Lucio throws the switch
Tones and notes composing us a picture
We're all Soldier: 76
Except we'll never be ripped
American kids getting to grips
With intricate weapons as heavy as bricks
Tracer'll race in the place
At a pace that'll make you say you're seeing stuff
Blink and you'll miss her blink
Like your ping isn't in sync
Cheers, luv

Oh
Watch over me
While you choose
Who you're going to be
Oh
Watch over me
While you show
The globe what you're going to be

Mei's the weather woman
Summon ice age and blizzards
Wither as you shiver in the bitter river
With a bit of couldn't give a whether you are triggered
And Widowmaker would have made a wicked woman in a Winnebago
Because her aim is homing in
From far away to wherever they go
Hanzo, the man bow
Samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows
Still life like a van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo
Bringing mojo to the dojo
It's Genji chucking a hurricane of shuriken
Encouraging a low pose
You're ducking, looking like Quasimodo
No joke
I'm a showboat that throws blows
At so-so joe blows when I no scope
Dead as dodos
Oh no
So watch over me
And decide who you're going to be

Oh
Watch over me
While you choose
Who you're going to be
Oh
Watch over me
While you show
The globe what you're going to be




 Some call me Ajay
Some call me Ajay
Like the voice stars never came on the same day
I came to spread my mom's ashes
Unaware of the clashes that lay in wait
My bus got bust at a routine stop
How many people have you seen shot?
I was taken away to the Himalayan base of Pagan Min
The Asian Nation
Of Kyrat's maniacal tyrannical flagrant king
He wanted to make me stay for dinner
But I was impatient, it made me think
Nah
I'm getting out of here
Nah, cos I really can't stand the atmosphere
And at this altitude my asthma's getting a tad severe

The top of the world
Is where I'm taking the fight
Gaze down on the valley of challenges
I face from the day to the night
The top of the Himalayas
Is the place I'm taking the fight
As I scatter a hand full of ashes
I'm blocking pagan's light

I ran into the golden path
A rabble of rebels, bold as brass
Rebuilding the rubble
That autocratic bastard soldier's smashed
The leaders are Amita and Sabal
Leading me to Shangri-la
And it seems to me that each of these
Couldn't be much angrier
It's time to get out
Head out
Get the lead out
'Til our influence has spread out
Keep it on the down low
As I beat another outpost
Call me the people's elbow
Cause I'm armed to the teeth
And I'm ready to pound bones
'Til they're looking like my damn bow
Move over, Rambo
What?
Are you going to bang doe?


Free radical
Beat animals
With my bare hands
Ripping meat from clavicles
A rhino hide's reet sellable
And the price of my life is invaluable
That's why I'm packing my cannons and molotovs
Every human beings flammable
Want to watch?
In a battle I tackle attackers and grapple
I don't want to stop 'til I'm on the top
Happy shopper packing a proper lot of flak
So back the fuck up
'Cos you never know what you're gonna get
My ammo pack is a box of chocolate
I got it on lock
I'm hotter than hot
As I'm stopping the choppers I spot
Chip off the block of my pop
If you're blocking my path
Then I'm popping your noggin like spots

(RAWR)




 To the Swedish administration
This is a plea of my own
On be half of Peter Sunde
My friends in Sweden
And around the world
We sailed a long way
We've trod the corridors of law
To reach the final door
The people have been patient
But its the final straw
They're waiting for someone
To show they've got a spinal cord
And challenge what the dinosaurs
All decide in court
Take a seat
And read the plea through comfortably
To see the numbers
1.corruption running deeper
Than a sea cucumber
2.to ring the police
And have them bring in Peter Sunde
Would simply be another
In a string of recent blunders
3. he's a man that's wrapped up
In mystique and wonder
So let this rap rip up
And tear your thin belief asunder
Peter Sunde
Freedom king or evil monster?
Should we let freedom ring
Or bring in the demon hunter?
It seems to me
That piracy's to thieve and plunder
To wreak a streak of greed
Among the seas to feed your hunger
And each of us did something mean
When he or she was younger
But when reason leaves arenas
Then it leaving me to wonder
See, cos until recently
Sweden won a reputation
Which it demonstrated
To more unprogressive nations
But when surrendering
To pressure from the states
Then their levels of respect
Entered a trend of degradation
That inevitably shakes
The nation's faith in legislation
So fling it out the window
Lest you face defenestration
And while the crocodiles
Are circling and salivating
I'll allocate an alligator
At the allegations
There's not a shred of evidence
To back up accusations
This case is an embarrassment
To your administration
Hur ska Peter
Ta sig ur denna situationen
Dan Bull tar upp
Den allmänna diskussionen
Jag lärde mig tillräckligt
Av det svenska språket
För att hjälpa Peter
Ur det dumma bråket
Detta är ett tydligt
Rättshaveri
Staten visar ett
övertydligt hyckleri
See, the Swedish legal system
Is under the scrutiny
Of a hundred million
Different computer screens
We've trod the corridors of law
To reach the final door
The people have been patient
But its the final straw
They're waiting for someone
To show they've got a spinal cord
So is it you
I'll leave you with that final thought




 Newspapers strewn
Warm bodies sprawling
Appalling
It'll be in the papers tomorrow morning
Along with mourning
The names of the fallen
Embodied in bold print for you to take as a warning
Never intervene with the American dream
We do whatever for the green
Fill you with lead up in the streets
For that liquid cash
Hot red liquid splash marks
Spattered on your dash then dash
Brash
We bring the hustle
Back to sinew and muscle
Cracked bone
Cracked glass
Cracked windows in the tussle
Flash ringing from the muzzle
'Til you're cinders in the rubble
I don't value pigs unless they're sniffing for the Truffles
I'm singing for the struggle
What you bringing to the scuffle?
I'm about to come and stick a pin into your bubble
Here's a cop killer for your trouble
Blood spattered on the asphalt
But it doesn't matter
Rat a tat tat
Fuck a black mask
When death is entertainment then I'd better act daft
Like the Beatles on the rooftop
The police'll never let it be or get me to stop
You or me are going to soon drop
Down a staircase flight or fire escape
To a violent fate
Fight or flight kick in right away
Rotate
But there's no turning back
You're going to roast
Flames are going to burn your back
Murder rap
I'm sure you've heard of that
This is the real deal
No limit to who we'll do in and what we'll steal
And if you feel ill
Then you can go away
This is the USA
If you can't take it you'll be thrown away
But if you don't back down you'll be blown away
Your wife'll tell your kids "Daddy isn't coming home today"
Mayday!
Mayday!
The situation's getting cray cray
I'm Jesse James in his heyday
I'll face your grenades, melee weapons, AKs
Arrange the date of your funeral
And the wake is my payday
They'll say that you were brave, pray
For the angels to change
The state's got to save face
I say grace
Cos tonight you dine in paradise
While I take a plane
Hijack a flight to Paraguay
I can't taste the prepackaged airline meal
And I can't say what the Hell I feel
You made a dogs dinner
On a dog day afternoon
I must be off, sorry
But I'm going have to shoot
Said You made a dogs dinner
On a dog day afternoon
I must be off, sorry
But I'm going have to shoot!
In God We Trust...




 Hey hey hey this is PewDiePie’s channel
And if you don’t like that I’ll slap you with a flannel
Hop on my camel and chase you to the North Pole
Aaaah my camel’s out of control!
Run, run, call the police
I’m going to the zoo there’s animals to release
I’ll take them all home and show them my games
Take pictures of them all (smile!) and keep them in frames
His name is PewDiePie, ladies claim he’s a cutie pie
Millions other disagree and say he’s just a stupid guy
So who is right? Let’s look at the facts
Dudes that like him, or that attack?
Hang on a sec, what does it matter?
Refuse to fight, it’s a horrible act

I could pick some bogeys out of my nose
Or watch something else that is gross with thousands of bros
I could learn to sew and make some outfits and clothes
Or I could buy a PewDiePie tee like thousands of bros

What you talkin bout, PewDiePie?
You’re not making any sense bro, you be high
You could wear a new Gucci suit and groovy tie
But you’ll never be as beautiful as PewDiePie

I’m taking on YouTube in a tutu, woo hoo
I’m bigger than you, you and you…boo hoo!
There’s loads of dudes getting in feuds with Pewds
But I’m infused with juice and ready to bruise these noobs
I’m a velocirapper, ferocious
A new subscriber every day since diplodocus
I’m clearly the dopest, the rest of you are hopeless
I’m on a global stage, you’re on some sofas
You’re bogus, hocus pocus, no focus
I can’t decide if I should punch you or give you a brofist
You look as if you stole your sister’s hair
Aww watch you gonna do, throw Mr. Chair?

I could write poetry and flowery prose
Or I could argue in the comments with thousands of bros
I could water the garden, I’ve got flowers to hose
Or I could stay inside the house online with thousands of bros

What you talkin bout, PewDiePie?
You’re not making any sense bro, you be high
You could wear a new Gucci suit and groovy tie
But you’ll never be as beautiful as PewDiePie

Edgar Allen, Edgar Allen, are you responsible for what I’m smellin?
I’m rippedy rapping and bibbedy bapping and hippedy hopping
There’s nobody stopping me., so whatever you’re watching
You better be paying attention to P…E…WDIEPIE
He’s even sweeter than a blueberry pie
I feel like I’m motherfucking stuck in this duck
It makes me want to quack like what the fuck is that
Genius Pewds strikes again with the speed of Raikkonen
And if I couldn’t watch his videos I think my life would end
So, goodbye bros, see you tomorrow
Yeah so, goodbye bros, No Stephano!

I could play a moba game for hours til pro
Or I could choose to stay on YouTube with thousands of bros
I could learn to sing to huge crowds at my shows
Or I could join the chorus of this one, how does it go?

What you talkin bout, PewDiePie?
You’re not making any sense bro, you be high
You could wear a new Gucci suit and groovy tie
But you’ll never be as beautiful as PewDiePie




 I feel a little bad dissing a healthy wholesome Christian channel
It's gonna hit a nerve, like a dentist drill just split enamel
But if you listen out, you'll hear some sounds that I'll be saying
That'll get inside your brain and you'll never feel quite the same
Now, for the benefit of kids to whom I've not been introduced
I'm Dan Bull, a man who'll make you think, but using cringey tunes
It's like an interview, except that I rip into you
With rhymes and lyrics that'll get inside and sting like Vindaloo
But I'm just dissing you to get the views, Mr. Pewds
Unlike Onision, who is just rude, I can resist a feud
I pick and choose my victims like you pick your whiskey, dude
Just get a whiff of those big digits and I hit the booze
I'm getting sick and woozy sniffing the Hibiki fumes
Just give us a minute, consider this an interlude
While I nick your format and I twist it to "Get pissed you lose"
So if you do get pissed at this dispute, I guess you missed the truth
It's just a new and different route for me to redistribute
My criticism of big issues by which we're each affected too
These days it hits the YouTubes before it hits the news
That's why they're swift to try to get a libel hit on you
So I just sit amused at this dispute for which a truce
Is just as blooming likely as if finding that they print the truth
You dream of receiving a teabagging from G-Dragon
But I don't think he'll go for a skinny Swedish Steve Bannon
I'd tell you to delete your channel but I'd be here all night
Hold tight, you made a keyboard macro to be "alt right"
Oh my, did I just push your buttons? You're the touchy type
You could be right aligned, centre, left, but you're not justified
If I could underline the stuff that I'm disgusted by
You'd just see stripes across the writing like a crusty white piece of tiger bread
I'd like to peek inside your head
So I could see just why you said the things that people like to get offended by
Sometimes it seems just like they really like to be upset
But on the other side, there could be times that we forget
If you breathe a breath and move your lips about in certain shapes
It makes it tricky to discern if you're dispersing hate
I personally believe that you're a decent person, great
So don't feed your haters with an easy way to circulate beliefs that you're in league with a certain recent German state
It's like a skirmish in the street, it's not even worth it, mate
You got the Wall Street Journal hating, they should give you some credit
You made a way to monetise from browsing your own subreddit
Yeah, let the fans make the content and you just get it
Ad lib over the top of it, you barely even need to edit
Now this sounds callous, but well, I'm just putting it out there
You used to have your art in galleries and now you sell chairs
Your network dropped you, your net worth dropped, you
Could be better off trying to get work in a shop, you
Might as well just drop Vlogs, go back to selling hot dogs
And speaking of hot dogs, they're absolutely not pugs
Actually, I feel bad for saying that, I'll leave them out of it
Now, 'cause it isn't your pets' fault their daddy smells of fish
Anyone can set a Yeti on a desk and shout at it
Come to think about it, it's the thing I'm doing now, flip
Picking controversial topics out to get the mouse clicks
Except if I was you now, I'd take the Mick of Auschwitz
How many million Jews died, Pewds? About six?
I guess that's insignificant to your subscriber count, Felix
If anyone wants to break their contract with Maker Studios
Pewdie knows a new solution: Just make a stupid joke
But wait a blooming moment, Maker Studios are owned by Disney
The very same Disney that made this scene
That's still available for kids of any age to see
Hmm, I guess it's different when they're Asian clichés
It's double standards, plus it's underhanded business practice
YouTube will never give a slapped wrist over Disney's tactics
They're bringing too many views from useful demographics
While declaring bans on other channels, it's undemocratic
You'll never crack the algorithm, it's too enigmatic
To reach your own subscribers now, you'd better be telepathic
So I guess we'll never know, but on a level, though
I'm empathetic for the other fellows signed to Revelmode
You took them on your ship, then left them on an Archipelago
About as relevant as Leafy, saying "swag" and "hella dope"
You're breaking YouTube's safety policy, be careful, bro
No I ent, I'm just taking the P, look, Kwebbelko
Take the letters of PewDiePie and turn them to an anagram:
"I wipe deep", is there somethin' that you wanna tell me, man?
You've gone from looking like a cheap G-Dragon rip off
To someone the police'd need to speak to, they received a tip off
I see your beard growing, so excuse me for assuming
But a primary sign of depression is neglecting your personal grooming
Fumbling through the kitchen, trying to stick together crap meals
Drinking whiskey on your own at home, I know how that feels
I understand, man, it's a cry for help
These are deep feelings each and every guy has felt
I say you're suffering in silence, it isn't that obsurd
You were in the Ricegum diss track and didn't rap a word




 Ok, look, I'm well aware, that this is probably going to sound insane (whip-woo)
But I honestly just fell out the back of a plane
Landed in a random bit of abandoned real estate
Then ran straight into the nearest place and here I stayed in the can
The place is a mess, but it's better than the outside (true)
And so I'm making a nest to settle down, hide
No doubt I'll cause an outcry, called a coward, but it's not that, it's just everyone else is overpowered (wa)
Would I like a vast exciting island to explore?
Err, thanks, but, no thanks
I'd rather hide behind this door not coming out (yeah)
Somebody's got to sort the plumbing out, blomming hell
You want to run around? Go bother someone else
Of all the places y'all could urinate, you're all up in my face
This ain't the place to fornicate in or negate the call of the nature
Sorry mate, we're all devoid of toilet paper, call in later
This cubicle's engaged, go locate a stall that's vacant (ha)
I've got important business, that's taking concentration
Waiting for the game to finish and faking constipation (uh)

I found a pistol in the bathroom
Somebody put a pistol in the bathroom (uh)
Somebody was cleaning their gun
While they were taking a shit
I found a pistol in the bathroom
Somebody put a pistol in the bathroom
I'm going to number one
With the gun I found in the bathroom

Oi Dan, what's the hold up?
Shh, nothing, I'm holed up and ready to unload on any soldier that rolls up (wa)
I'll leave your skull bust open like a walnut (wah)
With a hole in the middle like a bone donut
That was a trigger warning, so don't say I never told you
That you won't see me on the leaderboards, if you scroll up (pff)
I need to pass the time, I'm really bored
Oh look! Found some make up in the cabinet
And now I'm dolled up, dragged up
Sat on the bog and draggin on a roll up
This lavatory seat's freezing, I've got a cold butt (wo)
Now, you may say the way I play is soulless
I say it's realistic using the head of my shoulders
Because while everybody else is chasing after gold dust
I'm laying back and selling shovels in the gold rush
I'm in a toilet stall with a bullet hole in the wall
But if you go for glory, then I'll go for your balls

I found a pistol in the bathroom
Somebody put a pistol in the bathroom
Somebody was cleaning their gun
While they were taking a shit (uh)
I found a pistol in the bathroom
Somebody put a pistol in the bathroom
I'm going to number one
With the gun I found in the bathroom

Gnarly, how can you aim a shot at somebody you can't see?
No one saw me standing there, not even Paul McCartney (bruv)
You want me? Fucking well, come and find me
I'll be waiting with a gun and a pack of sarnies (jeez)
Now I'm not weapons trained and I don't know karate
But I'll fight you and your family and your army
If you think I'm coming out this bathroom - hardly
I'll be the last one in the chocolate factory like Charlie
Aw, you're not invited, it's a one man party
Not sharing my shelter for shit, I'm not Bob Marley
Not going to get up, stand up
There's too much burning and looting and having the gun jamming's
A concern, when you're shooting
Try my pioneering new type of conflict resolution
Hiding where guys are normally performing their ablutions
Just remember, when you're done to flush the latrine
This is the secret to the way I keep so fresh and so clean
If you're haveng PUBG problems, I feel bad for you, son
I beat ninety nine opponents and I haven't shot one

I found a pistol in the bathroom
Somebody put a pistol in the bathroom (woo)
Somebody was cleaning their gun
While they were taking a shit (hah)
I found a pistol in the bathroom
Somebody put a pistol in the bathroom (me?)
I'm going to number one
With the gun I found in the bathroom




 See me?
I stepped straight off the rugby pitch
Pierced my cauliflower ears
With the ugly stick
Fed up of scrummages
Where funny kids would hug me quick
I thought "I need a new sport"
Then it suddenly clicked
I'd jump ship
As soon as I could find a good port
Head to the States
And get a taste of college football
I'm standin' out
I make a talent scout say
"Hang about!
This is the man
That we've been tryin' to hatch a plan without?"
A British rugger lover
Over on shore leave
The kid's a lucky bugger
My clover's four-leafed
So don't ignore me
I'm on the road to glory
Rollin' over rows of foes
Like a coach and horsies
If only I was coachin' your team
Raw meat, I throw the ball deep
Into enemy territory
Takin' on all teams
The very best from each college
I'll tackle them so hard
They'll never eat solids
Demolish your defence
Leave them in the deep end
It's D-Day
The invasion of D-A-N
Check those credentials
Pro potential
My flow's torrential
So whatever you throw in my direction
Is inconsequential
Techniques are confidential
You wanna step to me?
Please, come on, be sensible
Petty fools
Try to knock me off my pedestal
Like the heavy fall
You're inevitably headed for
Reignin' forever
So you better head indoors
My whole rhyme's a goldmine
Fetch the Seven Dwarves
"Good heavens, Lord
What else do you have in store?"
I got it locked
Knock knockin' up on heaven's door
This is the situation
A British pitch invasion
Bringin' everythin' except the kitchen sink
Sorry, "kitchen basin"
And this is just the initiation
Of the Brit invasion
A bit of vindication
For the fact I never had an invitation
Still reignin' forever
Precipitation
A little bit of titillation




 Hey, what's happening, Z?
What's that, you're battling me?
Well actually
You're about to meet my Gatling Pea
I send you back to sleep;
You can come and take a dirt nap with me

You must be low on chloroplasts
Because your raps are weak
I'm causing a solar eclipse
For the whole of your clique
So nobody's growing an inch
'Til I roll over you:
Pins
You've got all the greens, roots, and pea shooters
So it's kind of ironic that your efforts seem fruitless
We're Zombies!
Yeah, you better be very scared of us
Because, just for you, we're temporarily vegetarians

Yeah but comparing plants vs zombies
Is apples and oranges...

That's cos we're opposites:
Capitalists and Communists-

-Capulets and Montagues
Come on, just be honest, dude!
You can't do half the practical shit that Monty Don could do
I'm the sweetest glucose producer
The yonkers of conkers
Odd Fuschia
Bring your whole ground force
I mow down foes
True to my roots, so don't doubt I won't go down low

Oh, Wow, Whoa!
The grass is always greener

Don't doubt, yo!

My raps is always meaner
Baseball star wth my face all scarred
I will raid your garden and take your car-
And by car I mean brains
But brains didn't rhyme
That's why I said that I would take your car
Mate, I'm a Gar...
...Gantuar

Really? I was thinking what a wanker you are

(Hey!)

Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

(Seriously, Zombies are the best)

Hit you with mushrooms
Pow!
Leave a mushroom cloud
That's one fewer task that I must do now
Feel the flower power of my Power Flower
Our powers combined will keep you routed for hours
The Jack Bauer of flowers
Attack towers, I'll clout you!
I smack cowboys and doubters
Pirates and parrots
Keep them out of my house!
Raa!

Ha haha ha!
Man, I laugh at your ballads
Hmm, what's on the menu?
I think I'm having a salad
Traverse your Astroturf
'Til the dirt is a path and I'll prove
I'm the top rapper in the Popcap back catalogue, Dude
(Yay!)

When you all attacked I'd have thought you must be insane
If it weren't for the mutual lack of a functioning brain
It ain't wise to go against the grain
I'm a thorn in your side causing no end of pain

It's a joke you think your flowers are powerful
(Ha Ha)
You know the Tower Defence
I know the Tau of War
(Whoa!)

That's a lie, that's a lie
You're just cadavers in morgues

But you could even be defeated by a shambling corpse
(Ooohh)

Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

(Ooohh)
Call me a bonehead
'Cause you can see the bone in my head
Call me a Cone Head
Because I put a cone on my head
(Yeah)
I don't need to be clever
My lines are so nice, check it
URRRRRGHHHHHHHHHH
We're kind of concise
And I'm not entirely sure
Why there are hordes of violent corpses
At the side of the lawn either
But we are inclined to use force

Well I'd say that you brainless failures
Were a pain in the anus
But that ain't the way that I do away with my waste, cuz
If you ain't hearing this
I make you face my acespearagus
There ain't a way that I can make it clearer than this:
Liches should know
I ditch the bitches and hoes
For ditches and hoes
And so I'm soaking you pricks with my hose

HA!
I'll murderize you
You're in deep shit now:
Fertilizer
I'll chow down on your hard fiber into my carcass
'Cause it's harvest time and I'm the combine harvester

Nah, man, I'm sick, bruh
Fam, I spit bars
Like Alan Titchmarsh
If he had a kid with Rick Ross
Me, I'm boasting on bumping beats
'Bout roasting you punks like pumpkin seeds
Me?
Hard Nut

You?
Bars suck!
Plants?

Champs
Zombies
Hard luck

Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

(Don't forget the Zombies)

Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

(Yeah, Zombies, Woo!)

Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

(UUUUUGHHHHHHHHHH)




 Since the Aug Incident
All the naturals have been more insolent
So bring your instruments
Let's make this shindig a bit more intimate

Ask Icarus, the gods are sick of us
Making a new rib from dust
The Lord made man in his own image
And this visage isn't really how he pictured us
Stars shine over the apartheid of our time
I can't lie, each side's only half right
Every atom has a half-life
Every Adam has a dark side
Damn, what happened last night?
The apartheid of our time
I can't lie, each side's only half right
Every atom has a half-life
Every Adam has a dark side

In every nation, segregation is the expectation
Jensen's an agent sent to center stage to change the station
Man's machinations demand moderation
Masses need emancipation and liberation
Morality's in need of mediation
Answers to what's improvement and what's mutilation
We don't need to wait for mutation
We took over from God with our body modification
Is it folly to play Daedelus? Is it dangerous
To aim for the place where the angel is?


I am a bit fraxious, ramming in praxis kits 'till I react anaphylaxis
I cannot relax since coming back from the blackness
Snapping your back as if I'm snapping a matchstick
I'm a black hat hacker with a fat chip
Sat on my shoulder revolving the ratchet, holding a hatchet
Losing hold of control 'til I'm batshit
Am I a man or just a the soul in a gadget?
I sit and think when I go to the latrine:
When I die, am I ghost in the machine?
Is there a code between a hope and a dream?
If not for the Neuropozyne, I'm sober and clean
Sneeking around halls and I'm peeking around corners
Thinking about bringing about peace, law and order
Reform the law, before there's deep disorder in the streets
'Cause I don't really want to be the enforcer
But I will if I'm made to, so stay in check
Ideas are contagious, they infect
So mind what you say and who it may affect
If life is a game, then it's Deus Ex




 Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to pay our last respects to our dear departed brother. We mourn his passing for he was a good man

I'm Killian Samuels, I used to be a US Marshal
Tracking down fugitives with the newest arsenal
Up 'til my passenger plane
Lost a couple of nuts and bolts and crashed
This hole's a bit of a culture clash
But don't let it hold you back
Now I'm a bounty hunter, rounding up chumps for a lump sum
Hunting pond scum amongst the clutter and junk, who wants some?
You'll need a strong stomach, this is not for the easily queasy
If you want something easy peasy, you're in the wrong street, believe me
Try to flee from me, you'll see the reason people fear me
Friends are few and far between so foes, I keep them near me
I'm getting closer and closer, so I hope you hear me clearly
Still on your toes believing you can deceive and beat me, really?!
Every day I'm facing death and a plethora of bigger threats
But I hate to say that I may be facing my biggest yet
My game development's been dropped and stubbed out like a cigarette
In an executive decision that may be gamer's biggest regret
Listen Bethesda, the first Prey was a great game, shame on you!
I pray that you make Prey 2 or I may prey on you
I don't know what happened behind the scenes to make it fall through
But I'm asking Pete Hines to please try to pull through
I'll buy the thing twice, even thrice if I need to
Just give the franchise the fans like so dear a reboot
I'll buy the thing twice, even thrice if I need to
I pray that you make Prey 2 or I may prey on you

Hah! No one's better than me
I rap for games that exist hypothetically




 Candlelight flickers across these hands that write
I sit and ponder the past and life
Just wishing and wanting an answer tonight
And so I am thinking and wondering asking why
Do things go wrong when they have been right
Where we used to frolic and laugh, we cry
Life's past its prime, I wish I could stop the hands of time
The end is nigh, a tick and a tock and the sands of time
Slip from the clock as they pass us by
As I'm sitting and watching the passers by
Stranded high, imprisoned and locked in the land of my mind
The living monotony hanging by
To limit and smother a man this shy
And to describe it's impossible though I can but try
And now as I lie, a shiver runs ominous down my spine
As a vision, a prophecy clouds my sight
I predict an apocalypse happens tonight
Clandestine, Our figurative god has cast the die
Has triggered the goal of his grand design
And the bigger the bomb is the faster we die
Abandon fright, and give up the worry and anger and spite
The difference is none if you stand and fight
So sisters and brothers hold hands, unite
While Dan says hi, and sings you a song as his last goodbye
Bye bye bye




 I don't think so mun- did... budget
I don't think much of Osborne's new budget
I don't think... uhm, can't say it

I know we don't have many golden nuggets but still
You've buggered up the budget and will
Cause old people to snuff it, their heating bill
Too high and they're dying 'cause they need their pills
And not knowing if you'll live until tomorrow
Is a bitter pill to swallow
The promises that you've fulfilled are hollow
Why are the poor, young, old and the needy
Repaying the bills that the greedy have borrowed?
Whether you lean to the left, or
Whether you lean to the right, I
Believe we can all agree that something's not quite right

I've got a feeling in my tummy tummy tummy
That there's people going hungry unneededly
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names
And
I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names, 'cause
While there's people shouting mayday, their
Bloody Bankers think it's payday

Hey
No admission from the coalition, no contrition
The decisions that they've laid out have made Great Britain different
The change they've saved is a pittance
In the face of the waste that's ingrained in the system
The way that they're shitting on us, taking the piss
It is as if there is a plague in the cistern, it's sickening
While we sit in front of Strictly
They're finishing us fiscally with strychnine
Do you think the children of Milton Keynes give a fuck
Whether you follow Milton or Keynes' economics?
Still you cleaned everybody's wallet out
So we're asking for the cash back, we want it now

I'm not trying to be funny funny funny
I'm just worried about money money money
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names
And
I'm not trying to be funny funny funny
I'm just worried about money money money
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names

Mr. Cameron reckons we're in it together
Yeah, except the ministers with cheddar and the sinners in the City
Sometimes I like to try and show off writing really cleverly
So apologies for the following extended silly simile:
The rioters'll never be as quiet as a feather
Freely flying through the heavens in the sky and gently settling
Upon the ground, sometimes I wander round
And wonder how my town could have become so bloody run down
You're giving us the runaround
Pushing some of us underground
I hear a thumping sound
But it's not a drum, it's crowds
Of British citizens who wish they'd never given you
The power that you now are using to give them the finger

My usual disposition's sunny sunny sunny
But I'm worried about money money money
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names, 'cause
It's been shown by many studies studies studies
You need an investment of public money money
To encourage spending and thus induce
Confidence in the market, an economic boost

Actually you could snatch a leaf from Clement Attlee
He did the opposite of you and it happened fantastically
We narrowly escaped catastrophe
'til Mrs. Thatcher undid it dastardly
No amnesty on bankers' salaries
Putting the lad or lass that needs it at last and least
That's not the path that leads to everlasting peace
So cut it out and bring back the beat

I'm not trying to be funny funny funny
I'm just worried about money money money
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names, 'cause
It's like a game of rugby rugby
The more you try the more that you get muddy muddy
It's like a game of rugby
The more you try the more you get covered in shit

Oh, the more you try
The more you try
The more you get covered in shit
Power to the people!




 It began
The same way
It ended

Let me set the scene, war is a hellish thing
Hellish as it's ever been, redefine what hellish means
It's Evergreen seeing men killing their fellow beings
Unheavenly screams pierced by deafening machines
Sacrificing actual lives and recompensed in pennies each
Said will this deceptive quest for peace never cease?
Did you ever see a friend in need flee in terror, he
Ebbed and weaved between threats and pleas, a wretch indeed
Wet feet drenched deep in the trench’s heat, each
Feverish skeleton trembling and clenching teeth
Tell me when the death of a wretch was the centrepiece
He’s just another leg wrenched from the centipede
A stampede, a legion proceeding when decreed
Chevaliers, regulars, levied men of every creed
Naïve men of seventeen, each a bel esprit
They’ve had their last meal, their blood’s an aperitif
A fellow dead at the speed at which he fell off his steed
Leaving yet another friend or family member to grieve
Pawns on a board where death is the referee
A living chess piece that’ll never get to Queen
There’s an enemy for every devotee of the regime
For whom doing the obscene extreme is routine
To then ascend the pecking order ‘til you get to chief
Reset the record to the Pleistocene
Beads of sweat, heaving chest, don’t forget to breathe
It seems to be progressive leads to being regressive beasts
The quest to be a better being fettered by aggressive greed
Tens of tens of centuries of horrendous deadly deeds
A veteran can never rest in peace
He’s a revenant, a lesson destined to repeat
Repeat

He’s a revenant, a lesson destined to repeat
A veteran can never rest in peace

Reset the record to the Pleistocene

 So it's nearly time for me to go
But I want to thank you for being here
It's been a pleasure
I mean that truly
And now I'm going to do a convoluted tune
A composition that I'm particularly proud of

Never been a fellow to be down with the Gs
Hardly ever collect felonies out on the street
My criminal record took minimal effort
To scribble and get all it down on a sheet
Me, I can do without the police
See, I'm a dude renowned to be tedious
No pissing about, I'm serious
I really just sit around on a seat
Read a book, put it down, have a wee
'til I feel I've had enough then I slouch in my PJs
These days when I'm counting my sheep
It takes me ages drowsing to sleep
Feel I'm thousands of feet out of my league
Like a floundering dinghy down in the deep
People shouting at me I'm not allowed on a beat
But there's four times more that'll tell me I'm sweet
I found my release when I bought me a mic
And recorded a tight lyric down on a beat
With the sound so loud that the speakers
Melt with the heat cos I'm Dan to the B

One, two, I'm counting to three
Then I want you, to bounce to the beat
From the North to the West to the South to the East
We can all get well rowdy

I oughtn't lie, I mean demographically
There's a hypothesis I support:
That I am the more priviliged in all of society
Quite unlike the baller I try and be
I was born in a nice region
And brought up politely
So I was taught to mind my Ps and Qs
And make way for OAPs in queues
I'm a decent dude, peaceful too
But on a beat I speak with lethal truth
This sequel to my debut album's
A way to tell them the good news:
That I'm a middle class kid from the Midlands
Less "safe" more like "how you diddling?"
I'm like a Polo without the middle in
More whole than the hole to fill it in
Though I'm a bitter kid, just a little bit
Bringing mint lyrics but no-one's listening
But I'm in the zone and I'm coveting the throne
So I'm not gonna give it in, gloves coming off and I'm boxing until I win
Watch when I'm in the ring
Roundhouse my doubts, bopping them in the chin
Plot thickening along with the smoke
But I'm not gonna choke - I've got ventolin
Like when I kicked my bong and it broke
It allowed me the freedom to breathe the air again
And now that I'm clean and the songs that I wrote then
Are out and they're seen I am proud to be me
You could tell when I'd been chilling out with some weed
I couldn't leave the house, you could smell the Febreze
Now when I'm out on an evening in town I'm a demon
Downing indecent amounts of Ribena
'til I'm down on my knees and in pieces
Weeping shouting "help me, please"
But when I'm having doubts about my belief
I just tell myself that I'm proud to be me

 Eighteen years, eighteen years
Been Rainbow Sixing for eighteen years
Eagles Watch as I throw Rogue Spears
Through Covert Ops to the Missions in Korea
A Lone Wolf pulls out the Black Thorn
As a Raven Shield meets Athena Sword
With her Iron Wrath flying like a Black Arrow
On Lockdown in the Critical Hour
See my game come of age as I take it to Vegas
And make it rain here for ages
And when the rain hits rays of light
From hazy skylines, rainbows shine bright

And when the rain hits rays of light
From hazy skylines, rainbows shine bright
(2x)

It's a daily crisis for today's fighters
In the age of ISIS
Death is the fate with which he dices
One wrong roll and he may lay lifeless
Too little, too late realising
Time dedicated to training's priceless
Pain and sweat's why a veteran is getting better
That'll tell us why there are calluses on my fist
We've got to work as a team, a unit
To deduce your scheme and ruin it
Swiftly we move in
Through these midnight trees whose leaves are moonlit
From the window to the wall
Everything you've ever come to know and love is going to fall
From a MAC-10 to an Enfield
Anything can trigger things real men feel (3x)


I wear these shades in a HALO
Take aim somewhere over the rainbow
Six of the best, in the chest is the payload
Hey bro, you'd better lay low
When I breeze in spinning, I'm a killer tornado
Waiting to blow like a pain volcano
I swear in the name of NATO
I'll put an X on your brain like a baked potato
We came with the caber to cave in your capers again, bruv
In the face of the danger
This ain't Vegas, but I'm raising the ante
And raising a glass in the name of Clancy




 Dear Benny and Rafi
I regretfully have to inform you of the tragic fact that I'm not incredibly happy
I went online the other day aiming to find another meme
And saw comments like: "FUCK THE FINE BROS, THEY GHEY"
I thought, "Hey wait, mate am I a day late?"
"What kind of cray cray hate bait did they make?"
So let me get this strange situation straight
And say straight away if I've made a grave mistake
You made your name with entertainment such as "Kids React"
A distillation of the name which is "React"
You claimed the trademark on the name under a federal act
To protect your brand from any imitation it attracts
So if a creator names a similar video with "react"
Then they've taken it from you and they should give it back
I can understand how you'd maybe want to limit that
But the claims you later made explaining it are inexact
That's why there's been attacks on Twitter and on Facebook lately
The brain sees straight away when statements are evasive, shady
YouTube's creative space has already been made dark
DMCA; Content ID; now we need trademarks?
You said of course it only applies to your format
But didn't define the type of thing you would or wouldn't call that?
You said it's "all the elements mixed together"
But when Ellen sits with kids and reminisces it's "whatever"
You said, "here's the link to her thread, now get and tell her"
Funny how that post disappeared, innit, Penn and Teller?
If you had to give an adjective to Ellen DeGeneres
Generally it'd tend to be genuine; elegant; generous
But if you choose to use disingenuous
Then you must lack the trust you ask of us
Gentlemen, you come across as jealous, stingy, salty as a jellyfish
Like Gabriel telling God he came up with Genesis
Now that's just rude, and if that's your actual attitude
How can YouTubers just sit back relaxed and absolutely sure that they're "React approved"
And not "React accused"?
I'm a tad confused if I can now react to you
Without being asked
"Remove it now or else you're getting axed, or sued"
I don't want to have disputes
It's a drag to get a flag removed
Ask Buzz Aldrin, his is still stuck at the moon
Now you're some business savvy dudes
I see how your tactic's shrewd
I can still jump out the plane, from any altitude
But you trademarked the safety cord and patented the parachute
Now that's some powers you could now abuse
Unless we point it out to you just what you have to lose
Pass the lube
Don't actually..pass the lube..




 I used to think wrestling was real
But it was just a big show, muscles and athletic skill
Big deal, it's no biggie
Steel buns and guns are as tight as O'Neills patrons on a Friday night
Whiskey on the rocks
She might be darn young but at least she fucks
I'll undertake a challenge that you may have missed, bro
How many puns of wrestlers' names I could list though?
I force a word to mean another thing
Line after line, page after page punning, I'm the king
But it comes with a cost, it's knackering, I could drop
I need a coffee, kings don't flop
Shall I turn the camera on and bask in the stardust?
Though I'm more at home with a book or tea and a cigar, trust
I've got folders full of bars like gold dust
They sting like the frostbite, I'm stone cold
As defrosting, clearing a path through the mist
'Til I emerge as the victor, just taking care of business
Putting dudes to sleep, making art ruthlessly
It's not a ruse or fad, and Dan goes too, too deep
I'm too cheeky, so I should go for Nando's
I'm Randy, you ought to not ever marry Dan, ho
Breaking vows, breaking down the fourth wall of Jericho
My favourite ever snack when I smoke an L? Doritos!
You Hippie, take another X, save your woods
Chyeah, you so cheesy, this brie better be good
We're in the Colosseum, you're a Christian, I'm a lion
This is my den, you're just another Daniel
Briny seas I row across that make any grand boat
Smash up on those actual banks; "Don't you mean sand though?"
But alas, you're just another Mary damn Rose
Since Adam rose from the sand, he and and bros
Have been attacking, trying to cripple my flow, man
It's a little stark when you attack a Bron strawman
How can you lack ever knowing surf, rolling seas
Without ever growing as a human being
I sail round the horns, while girls sway all round my horn, all over again
Hit you right back to the Roman reigns, archaeologists find remains
On the heaths later, still in loads of pain
Red hot as summer rays, it's a shame it's going to cane
I'll have a bottle of bubbly but then I'm leaving
The jägerbombs are going to my head, I can't even
You should hit the John, seeing as you stepped in something dank
Look at the bottom of your shoe, it's definitely muck, man
And I tell you, I never let you jack swagger from me
Look at my willy, I'm regal to a D
Or even double D, you know me, I'm large
Make you laugh with the triple H: Ha ha ha!

Wrestling is real
Wrestling is real
C'mon
Wrestling is real




 I am Andrew Ryan
And I'm here to ask you a question...

Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?
The Man in Moscow would spread it to the rest of the crowd
The Man in Washington would offer it to the lazy and the poor
He in the Vatican would proffer as he prays to the Lord
I rejected those philosophies as backward
They squandered men's prospects, economies were fractured
I shunned detractor's ideologies, shrugged off the Atlas
Adapted Adam's Eden for the man who manufactures
I chose what was impossible to capture
I chose... Rapture
Where artists can work free from controversial quarrels
And scientists can pioneer beyond the world of morals
And with the sweat of your brow
Rapture can become your city as well
Join me, Andrew Ryan
Follow my dream
Find me, finally
Join me, would you kindly?

Rapture... is coming back to life
Her lungs fill with the will to survive
Rapture... is coming back to life
Finding truth between the lines in a book full of lies
Rapture... is coming back to life
Shops and schools humming with the thoughts of young minds
Rapture... is coming back to life
My city will live, my city will thrive

Being restricted by minor men was tiring to me
If no land was fit to witness the might of Ryan Industries
Then I'd find a ship to fit my vision, try it in the deep
Besides, you can build towers higher from the sea
With Ayn Rand guiding my hand, our divine plan
Transcended flights of fancy or lines in the sand
Deep, deep beneath the waves, under untold bars of pressure
A dark castle full of Art Deco architecture
Part venture capitalist investor, part art director
Hard Objectivism's the correct decision, disregard the lecture
I'm part card shark, part card collector
Part father figure, part protector, part corrector
Part confessor, part professor, dot connector, lie detector
Part Tsar, projector of a spark, settler, tower erector
A man chooses, a slave obeys
So would you kindly? Powerful phrase

Rapture... is coming back to life
Her lungs fill with the will to survive
Rapture... is coming back to life
Finding truth between the lines in a book full of lies
Rapture... is coming back to life
Shops and schools humming with the thoughts of young minds
Rapture... is coming back to life
My city will live, my city will thrive

Would you kindly... subscribe to this channel?
Would you kindly... buy the MP3?

Rapture... is coming back to life
Her lungs fill with the will to survive
Rapture... is coming back to life
Finding truth between the lines in a book full of lies
Rapture... is coming back to life
Shops and schools humming with the thoughts of young minds
Rapture... is coming back to life
My city will live, my city will thrive




 Ay
Look

The Glade of Dreams is in danger, my friend, so…
Wake your mates, preparate for adventure
The tension and the suspense is getting immense
A set of events that doesn't make any sense
Enter the dream team
We've got the teensies
A little blue big nosed load of wee beings
Then we've got Globox
My best chum
Whose refreshingest of beverages
Is a cup of plum juice
Barbara the Aryan Barbarian
There is barely a woman wearing fierier hair
And then there is nobody on Earth who so rarely
Frowns as infrequently as Murfy the Fairy
And now for the star of the show me, Rayman
Slightly insane, man
I might need a brain scan

Hey man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha!
Hooray, man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha! Hee!

The Bubble Dreamer is deep asleep
And he seems to be
Struggling with a heap of trouble
In his dreams and this means
For us that there is going to be
The meanest of repercussions
Just look at these stacks of paintings, they're captivating
We took a little peek and they snapped us straight in
Racing all over the world with my good chums
Taking out all the horrid little hoodlums
I hope you've got good thumb reflexes
To get enough good lums to afford a Lexus
It'll cost you an arm and a leg
'Til you're looking like me
Just some garms and a head
But I don't consider it a disability
Having no limbs gives ridiculous agility

Hey man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha!
Hooray, man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha! Hee!

I'm an acrobatic combatant compatible with rapping
Because my reactions are faster than actual magic is
A manic man with detachable hands and his gang
That's all that stands up to battle these anarchists
Running around, I jump on the ground
Up and then down, look what I found
Strumming it loud in front of a crowd
A wonderful sound

Hey man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha!
Hooray, man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha! Hee!
My name's Rayman
And I'm the main man
My name's Rayman
And I'm the main man
My name's Rayman
And I'm the main man
My name's Rayman
And I'm the main man
Hey, man! Ha!




 Fresh... for 1911, you suckas!
Listen, I got a story to tell

His name was John Marston, a hard un former outlaw
Taken by the FBI, so what they let him out for?
They wanted him to scout where his old gang hanged
And help them to see that his old gang hanged
They were a rag tag band ravaging the badlands
There was only one way that this'd end: Bang! Bang!
Found Bill Williamson at Fort Mercer
Met the wrong end of his gun, could call it murder
But Marston was found, dying parched on the ground
By the bonniest farmer around: Bonnie MacFarlane and now
John in his honour did odd jobs with her father and helped
Looped lassos lobbed and fires put out
Riding the finest mount, got to explore
Living the life that he liked in the great outdoors
Ambushing, hunting, trapping, interrupting public hangings
Such a bunch of random encounters and misunderstandings
But I'm not done with rambling, and John's not done with gambling
Dueling, looking out for bounties, pulling plants and fully handling
Any damn business this district could imagine witnessing
Hanging with Dickens, Harold, Landon Ricketts
Attacking antagonists from henchmen to the head, the boss
From van der Linde, Allende to Edgar Ross
Enter Dead Eye, whereby time kinda stops
Then many enemies get shot, a lot
Guns cocked and locked, one shot could stop an ox
Options? Not a lot; they've got to drop
'Cos they're chock a block with bullet holes like dot to dot
Those watching are like "What the fock?!"
Got their attention, that's audience retention
Enemies left red and dead: redemption
Got your attention, that's audience retention
Enemies left red and dead: redemption

Red Dead Redemption
Red Dead Redemption
Red Dead Redemption
Red Dead Redemption




 I had dreams of starring in spaghetti westerns
I'd be Clint Eastwood
But he's tough, and better dressed
But luckily for me
There is a way to live my fantasy
The Red Dead franchise
Will let me be that man for cheap
My own family won't even know me
I'm Dan Houser meets Sergio Leone
I saw the trailer for the game
And thought my brain would fall away
It made my morning great
Tore away the ball and chain
I say i'm Dan Houser meets Sergio Leone
Now hang about a moment
While I saddle up my pony
I'm ready to roam
Into the desert alone
Stepping into the unknown
Heading in westward ho
Ahead of the heather the zephyr has blown
I'm there for the treasure, the throne
Whenever I get it I'm setting off home
To my homestead
Where i'd better declare my intention to own
Red Dead Redemption
But wait
What did we forget to mention?
A simultaneous release on Steam?
No intention
But why do you feel the need
To tease the PC players?
To keep us waiting is the cheapest sales technique
The same as GTA is
So yet again the Steam train's been delayed
Come on, Rockstar
That's a cheeky way to treat a mate
Yeah, make us pay upon the day you brought it out once
Then port to PC after about
Ooh
Twelve months
Back in the 90's you guys were PC pioneers
The kind i'd like to buy a beer
Here's my shoulder, cry a tear
Now you provide a new title every five years
On proprietary gear
Just let me buy it here
See, i'm Dan Houser meets Sergio Leone
If Sergio Leone was only owned by Sony

Fkin' blow me
I'm sorry I said that




 Ah
Ah
Ah
This is who?
Nerdcubed, using Dan Bull's voice-box
Bringing that arcade sensation as the coin drops-
Into the slot and the screen flickers on
The girls scream and struggle to keep their knickers on
If you're fed up with frantic editing
Gigantic lettering
And hammock-centric extroverts manically bellowing
Then Dan's your sedative
A passively clever kid
Who rarely throws a tantrum
In fact, I don't think he ever did!

It's not a place for haters to hurt noobs
It's the ever-loving domain of the Nerdcubed!
The kind of place to play such an absurd tune, as this
It's the domain of the Nerdcubed
The Nerdcubed
(I say!)
It's the domain of the Nerdcubed

Hey guys! Check out this crazy game!
It's called MEME SIMULATOR three thousand and... something
It's wacky! It's wack- look how wacky I am, too!

Hey!
No more procrastination
Just pure fascination
With the sort of games that one just has to play, sure
Discovering a rating is my number one aim
But I'm not a YouTuber, just a guy who loves games
So if your preference isn't obstreperous recklessness
But giving deference to 80's pop culture references
And you totally recall that woman with the third boob
You're in perfect company... with the Nerdcubed
The Nerdcubed
The Nerdcubed
The Nerd-who?
The Nerdcubed




 Regarding cricket
The object is not wickets
It's about who can bring the biggest naval frigate
And although our military has recently diminished significantly, we
Pommies
Will arrive on your shores with the force of a tsunami
So run back to your mommy
Who needs the atomic bomb when you've got the Barmy Army?
New age English Tommies
We're a larger imposing threat
Than that of the Commies
In the 1950s
We've beaten the West Indians, Zimbabweans, Namibians
South Africans, Jamaicans and Sri Lankans
And the Pakistanis, who were particularly shoddy
We broke their will like a faulty latex rubber johnny
So I don't mean to come across as snobby
But an Aussie isn't something that particularly bothers me
I'm not a bigot
But regarding cricket
I don't need a ticket
I stay comfy in my armchair
Hidden away like Monty Panesar's hair
Panesar Panesar Pane Panesar Panesar
Panesar Panesar Pane Panesar
Regarding cricket
Our odds of winning are shorter than a midget
The sum of our runs will come to triple digits
And once we've begun, we won't succumb, we won't relinquish
Til we've ripped this wretched district
Into bits quick, it's horrific
The skill exhibited will kill your spirit quick
Until it is the integrity of a soaked rich tea biscuit
Once I've dipped it
In my tea
Oh, and by the way, I'm also an MC
Ripping the track, taking your ball, never giving it back
One of the best leg spinners to bat in the entire history of rap
I display a way with words that's patently absurd
I've stayed at the top of my game far longer than Dickie Bird, Observe:
I was in Australia on the day the bails were burned
And ever since I've yearned for the return of that little urn
It's a longing, an urge, the wanting of birds and bonking
Disperses into insignificance compared to that one thing
Now allow me to tell you something that I've heard
Ricky Ponting's skills are somewhat wanting in that regard
Regard, regard, regarding cricket
Certain players are depraved and thus they behave in ways illicit
If I drop my trousers and expose my rump, will you kiss it?
For luck
I said if I pull my trousers down and present you my rump, will you kiss it
On the off stump?
Will you kiss it?
( end like this)




 I invited a crowd of people
Out into the middle of Bromsgrove
To do the intro to this track
Nice big crowd of people shouting
Pussycut kind of thing
As for the three people who turned up
Thanks
I appreciate the effort

The time I spent in ashton field doing track and field
Heading down the chippy to grab myself a slap up meal
Blackwell bike rides, having a nice time
Get out the fucking playground this my slide
Sunny summers days and drizzly winters
Ripping my finger wincing cause I gotta a little splinter
My mum would help me pull it out with tweezers
I got more to thank her for than Jesus
Shout out to all my CFE believers
I feel and grieve my lack of faith has made a rift that’s deep between us
These churches have such lovely architecture
I remember Reverend White giving us a barmy lecture
I thought I went to state school, but I was made a fool of
Soz, I'm going to need some time to cool off
Teaching babies the fables of the Bible
As if they're true tales is a failure and I’m riled up

Go to the Waterstones in Bromsgrove Highstreet
The spirituality shelf is quite deep
Meanwhile, the section of philosophy is nowhere to be seen
A logical lobotomy
Literacy is the bottom of the pile round these parts
Education? Don't even make me start
I got a weak heart, and I'm getting dead frustrated
On how difficult it is to just get educated
Oooh a split infinitive, I've been a hypocrite
Hey shut the fuck up prick I'm going to split ya lip
You're not worth this shit
Despite the fact that on occasion I crave to be evil like I'm Eartha Kitt
That's an obscure reference, have you heard of it?
In fact were you paying attention to a word of it?
I'm the parish councils ‘versatile verbalist
Gimme a country  backing track I'll murder it

Kay, I'd like to continue my monologue now

Came from a sleepy town, I let it beat me down
I wonder if my music teachers can see me now
Mrs Brown, Mrs (Funny?), Mr (Hope?) and Mr Cox
I'd like to point that Mr Cox is a cock!
Once he told me off because I fell off my chair when someone pulled it out
Sir, tell me how is it fair?
My form of shouting is rare
Anecdotes funny quotes and I'm quite polite
And nice I’ll never try to ram down your throat
Half country bumpkin, half towny bloke
A Love hate relationship with the town around me though
I like the green I like the trees and I like the decent people
I don't like the crime, sleaze and all the meanie people
I mean we're all human beings created clearly equally
Then why do some play nice and some behavior is clearly evil
People, are giving me a migraine
The pain in my brain makes me aim to my grave

1 time for your motherfucking mind
This goes out to everybody in North Worcestershire
People who are nice and care about other people
To Sammy Lion, I still think about you
Bart Green, Lewis Wright, Chris (cocktaul?), Chris Harris, Chris Bon?, Chris Hook
All the other Chris'
Charford Raiders

Sam Parish, who made fun of me for having simplistic lyrics
Look where I am now, ya dickhead
What's your band doing? Prick
James Dike, stabbed me with a drawing pen
Kevin Murphy, stabbed me with a compus
Daniel Abbott, funniest child in the 1990s
2014 is really fun
Let’s all be nice to each other
Except Sam Parish and Sam Western
Cause there were, disrespectful to me as a musician
And a human being




 Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome you today
To the brand new format Republican debate
In a desperate attempt to increase the ratings
We're making the candidates rap when they say things
Bring it bitch, I'm Newt Gingrich
I want to rob the poor and then give it to the stinking rich
I'll make your sphincter itch; pain in the asshole
Economically the opposite of Castro
I'm Ron Paul, my following's devout as John Paul
The one all the libertarians have longed for
I want small government, no taxation
And my tracks played on every radio rap station
Who twists lyrics like a Rubik's Cube?
It's Mitt Romney, repping Massachussets, you pricks
People ask me what to do with the gays
I say send them away to Guantanamo Bay
I look like someone from a Star Trek fan forum
What's my name, bitch? It's Rick Santorum
My shit's damn boring and I'm homophobic too
Except I believe that homos should go into a zoo
I'm slick Rick Perry, the Texas state governor
A southener Republican motherfucker
That's coming to fuck up enemies with the death penalty
If they're mentally retarded don't bother telling me
I don't give a fuck




 Sliding doors divide and all
The nightmarish corridors
Will all fall
Behind you

Sliding doorways divide
And all the winding corridors fall away behind
Rays of light serenade my eyes
And wide white clouds parade the skies
After days and nights of grey
It's quite breathtaking in such amazing sights
I've paid the price, stayed inside
And it's been great but I need to say goodbye
The grape is ripe so maybe I should build the bottle
To fill the bottle, taste the wine
Now I've found how to savour life
All thoughts of pain inside fade and die
I take the fight to paper, hibernate and write in waiting
'til it's time to face my fright and take the mic
I've made the right choice in raising my voice
And reclaiming life's joys


If you've ever had a dream then chase it
Cos it's dreams that make us more than meat for grave diggers
Do you really want to remain faceless
Cos you dated aspirations but became faithless?
Be safe, stay put, each day's painless
Or regain faith, though we face dangers
Be brave, courageous, behave audaciously
My teenage daydreams made me famous
But being flavour of the week
Leaves a taint on the tastebuds, so I need to shape up
I tighten the laces in each of my trainers
Then retrace my steps to when I believed I could get
To each place I set my aim on
Not accepted fate, and reshaped my destination
I've not reached places yet that truly take my breath away
I'll never til the day of my death


We've had a really lovely time
But I ought to make a move
I've things to do
And I'm kind of assuming that you do too

The end is almost here
Here we go
Finished




 By the nine, it's been five long years since I've come here
So I think I'm perfectly entitled to cry one tear
And now I want beer
And I need a mead and thanks to this bucket we don't have to buy one here
I've just baked up a fresh batch of sweetrolls, would you like one dear?
I should head back to my Hearthfire before the Dawnguard start lecturing
But my belly's full and inventory's empty so we'd better get adventuring
Pick up a weapon
Then pick a direction
Then pick a dungeon that we're entering
No fast travel, just treasuring every texture that's rendering
Quest:
Reliving our memories and carving out some new ones
With newer and shinier hardware you can do whatever you want
Is it just me or have mods made this world change in odd ways
My frosty droplets of snot are thawed under the God rays
They drip in the mountain water, glistening
Trickling sounds are sort of twinkling
Rippling out I'm sure if you're listening
Your hair's on end and your pores are tingling
My legacy, odyssey, elegy, prophecy's better than ever
You're probably getting euphoric and wobbly
In bed in pyjamas
But it feels like ebony armor
It's Godly
I am the Dragonborn and thus I'm dragging you back to my birthplace
I've got unfinished business, I never did the main quest in the first place
So many side missions, civil wars, guilds and factions
How can I ever 100% a game that filled with distractions
Refractions and reflections
Weapon sets and plant collections
Never ending
Harry... uh, Harry
Pants
Erection




 So Boyzone plan to play without Gately
So what? Other bands do the same daily
I ought to mind what I say or I'll have to call a lawyer
'Cause when annoyed fans of boy bands are coming for you
It's a tad worrying, especially for Jan Moir
Jon Venables has been a very bad boy again
He was meant to be a friendly
Decent fellow with a fresh idendity
Let me see, it's a bit tricky, rehabilitation
When you're the most reviled child killer in the nation
'Cause when you're famous for that it's hard to chat to neighbours
About the past or how crap your day was
Looks like it's not just us that's had to pay the cost
And speaking of creepy boys, Jedward have just been dropped
Hillary Clinton's been venting on the phone
To the Israelis about the extension on their home
Now I don't claim to know the ins and outs of it
And I realise the sensitivity needed since Auschwitz
But I'm a bit thick so tell me this:
Why do two disciples of the same man, Abraham
Find it harder to get on than a unicycle?
I've rifled through the Bible, the Torah and the Koran
I challenge you to find it where it orders you
To build a giant wall drop, white phosphorous
Or fire rockets across to stop the Zionist rule
It's the kind of stupid rivalry fools do in primary schools
Due to undeveloped pituitaries and tiny balls
I find it all quite baffling
Like the fact the British Airways
Cabin crews would plan to pack it in while back in Britain
'Cause if that was me I wouldn't go on strike
Until the plane had landed in a place I quite like
Or just find a new job if I was that adamant
Apparently Hull City are after new managament
Beckham's torn a ligament, it's typical isn't it?
At his age he should have been a little bit more vigilant
But the real issue is will he heal?
'Cause if he doesn't that'll be the team's Achilles' heel
We've been delivered a curveball before

 RISE

I bring the beat to life, speak my mind
People take a peek inside, believe I'm nice
Hear me defy thee to even find an MC as deep as I
A decent guy sweet as a piece of pecan pie
When he combines beats and rhymes
Even blind people might see the light
Beaming bright either side, gleaming like streets at night
So seek and ye shall find peace of mind deep inside
No need to read the fine line prints or reason why
Don't even try, ask me and I will be your guide
Lead you by the hand and you will see the sights
Feel a vibe tease your spine and leave you feeling fine
You'll be excited to be alive
From calves, knees and thighs to heartbeats and minds
We can lead a life of peace and kindness or we can fight, just

Rise, until the sun's in your eyes

My eagle eye will read between the lines
And see the lies these deceivers write
They cynically decide the things you need to buy
And then repeat the cycle until the people all believe it's right
We need to realise it's free to be polite
And treat a being like he or she is being equalised
Don't know why we demonise and penalise
Effectively illegalise genotypes
What happened to being nice
To each and every being we see alive ?
Treat them right
That's why me I keep on trying to lead a vegan life
Though cheese is nice, we eat the seasons, spices
Denying the beast beneath has rights
Cause keeping meat inside us is a sign that here lies
A survivor, no need to read the rites, we succeeded quite
Well enough, it's tough enough to put the greed aside
Even I let ego stride in and feed my pride
But if we can rise above conceit and fight
For love, then we can climb the peaks 'til finally goodbye
From our teeth and eyes to hearbeats and minds
You've seen us lead a life of peace and kindness
Get off your seat and...




 I can't let myself fall in love
Because I fall too hard
And I might break something

That face of yours is nowhere near to perfect
But the way I've been I don't even deserve it
I'm feeling as nervous now as I ever have
And with each glance with which I see you it worsens
Personally I'd be pleased being your servant like Venus in Furs
Just don't leave me in the lurch
There's no reason or working to the feelings, I'm hurting
So please, give me a relief from the burden
The pipe dreams of my being with her
I mean who wants to sleep with a geek with Aspergers
I've seen and I've heard all I've needed to learn
And come to be with the terms that I'm the feeblest nerd
All you need is a skirt and some legs, a turn of the head
A wee little flirt and you're off with the bees and the birds
But I'll never stick my dick six inch deep in a bird
'til I leave in a hearse and I'm six feet deep in the dirt


I can only be creative when I see my failings
And say "this is me, now face it please"
Cos the beat's a piece of paper for me to make a confession
And get the stress off my chest until I meet my maker

I read the signals wrong, hymn book open at the wrong page
But I still tried to sing along
Not long ago I thought bring it on
Then I got re-absorbed into the bitter smog
I've bitten off a piece of my own heart
So don't start on how I've missed an opportunity
Too stupid to see who'd wanna be stuck with such a human as me
I've only got you in my dreams
My balls and my word are all but unheard of
So when I fall from my perch it's all I deserve
Once in a blue moon I fall for a girl
And when I do, I'm betting you I fall and get hurt




 I never liked football at school
Was never liked much by the cool kids
And I wasn't picked from the line up
Until the last, it was tough, it was cruel
And I wasn't into motor racing
It seemed too slow, too basic
Crashing was a no no
Ramming other cars was rated too invasive
Come on
Let me put them through their paces
Let's do it properly
Lick a shoot of broccoli
Buckle up and boot up ROCKET LEAGUE

SUPERSONIC ACROBATIC ROCKET-POWERED BATTLE-CARS
WITH WHEELS AND GRILLS
IN PLACE OF HEELS
OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA
GET TACKLED HARD

Little cars and big balls
Big balls, little cars
The crowd count down aloud
View the newest shooting stars
Little cars and big balls
Big balls, little cars
3, 2, 1, CHARGE!

Mix Fifa, Tony Hawk and Carmageddon
I'm in heaven even at the thought of it
In half a second, I'm tumescent
Move aside viagra
I'm throbbing at the bonnet
Of an E-Type Jaguar
I'm flustered
The rush has got me gushing like niagara
Rap star
Soccer crossed with Nascar
Not a crowd pleaser
I leave the people shouting:
THAT'S HARSH!
I do what I gots to do
To get those bawls
To bless those goals
Don't give a shit
If you drive a silver shadow, man
I'll wreck your rolls

Little cars and big balls
Big balls, little cars
The crowd count down aloud
View the newest shooting stars
Little cars and big balls
Big balls, little cars
3, 2, 1, CHARGE!

When I burn out my nitro
Better turn down your iso
It's a photo finish so
The arena just might blow
I might go psycho
Supercharged like a rhino
Large like a dino
Size aside
My machine
Is anything but micro
I'm coming for you fast
You scummy little twat
You just got battered
By a car
In a funny little hat

SUPERSONIC ACROBATIC ROCKET-POWERED BATTLE-CARS
WITH WHEELS AND GRILLS
IN PLACE OF HEELS
OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA
GET TACKLED HARD

Little cars and big balls
Big balls, little cars

Little cars and big balls
Big balls, little cars

 When I was little I wanted to be a rockstar
But I thought playing guitar would be rock hard
Taught myself a couple of chords but never got far
So instead I picked a mic up and dropped bars
And I’ve done alright, my rhymes are more tight
Than the average, I tell you that isn’t a pork pie
But please give me a minute, let me be forthright
I wish I’d had the foresight to give my fingers more time
Instead I let them get bored, on the fretboard
But now I’ve found a course, and got it cracked like a fault line
I learnt less in all my life than in the last fortnight
Propelled my elevation level as if it was cordite
Now I can hack at my axe, and rock it all night
If rock is a thrill ride, then Rocksmith’s your tour guide
Of course I’ve still got to put the time into it
But the fact is with practice, I know I can do it

Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
Never mind pressing buttons
I know how to pluck strings
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
I never dreamed
I’d be able to play such things

Unlike the Deftones, I was tone def
Leppards never change their spots, I’m just a radiohead
Music left me with an aching head, not a head rush
Crimson red blush, less trust then Jeb Bush
I’m not an early riser, could never rise against
The procrastination, it was always I versus them
I couldn’t find a muse, or iron out the kinks
I could kiss goodbye to screaming females, I was jinxed
Wanted to slay em ike I’m waving a katana
Or magic wands, make a splashh, take them to Nirvana
Play in my pyjamas, as heavy as a monster truck
Never mind the who, what, why, no-one wants to suck
The police in Boston aren’t even as tough as this
RSI, callouses and blisters, I’ve suffered it
But I’ll never stop playing guitar
Until all that remains of my nails are scars

Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
Never mind pressing buttons
I know how to pluck strings
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
I never dreamed
I’d be able to play such things




 Hahahaha
Rhino Tank God
Ayy, ayy

There's a few things that I wanna say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star, ayy)
I've been playing GTA since '98
So I've been down with you lot right from the start (the start)
When running over Hare Krishnas
Was rewarded with the sound "Gouranga!" (-ranga)
I learnt swearing thanks to you, if I hadn't
I'd still be saying "Gosh, darn" (gosh darn, by Jove, ayy, ayy)

Played the story mode of GTA V
Every day, all summer, got far (got far, ayy)
Then it glitched, I lost my progress, I was pissed
Had a face like a slapped arse (slapped arse, ayy)
Plus quit GTA Online 'cause hackers got free stuff
For which I got charged (got charged, ayy)
Wasted every penny of my money
On a Megalodon shark card (shark card)

There's some more stuff that I wanna say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star, ayy, ayy)
How come you don't bother using the face engine
You used in LA Noire? (-A Noire)
It was such a cool way to incorporate the faces
Of real actors (actors)
Their expressions were as entertaining
As when Jack Thompson got disbarred
He was so annoying, blaming all the violence on games
Saying GTA was the way murderers had been trained
Saying "I want it banned" (ayy, ayy)
Kind of like how you never made a PC Red Dead Redemption
And even despite the undeniable demand
You're disappointing the fans (yeah, ayy)

One final thing that I want to say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star)
Why you never made another Grand Theft Auto
That is set in London? (London)
Now you're based in New York, you forgot your humble roots
In Edinburgh (-burgh)
Or Dundee, I couldn't tell from my research
But definitely in Scotland (Scotland)

Is it bad that I just wanna hear a pedestrian
Shouting "tosser"? (tosser)
Swearing like a British person is at risk
Of becoming a lost art (lost art)
Wouldn't it be fun to hear the word "wanker"
More often in the pop charts? (pop charts)
That's currently the end of the list
Of things I want to say to Rockstar (-star)

I'm singing the same melody as before
But transposed by an octave (-ave)
(Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar)




 At eight or ten I wondered why my voice wasn't breaking yet
I was impatient to get from A to Z
So I'd break a sweat, play cassettes in my tape deck
Waiting for the day I could step to a stage
And get paid respect, paid a cheque
Maybe other kids would even play with me then
It's great to pretend the tune was written for you
That's why you sing with the radio while it ignores you
You perform awful but feel a lot better
Boom Boom Boom, Her Come the Hotstepper
Even back then my preference was funky
But less funky house than House in the Country
Syncopation, soul, anybody ill with it
Other kids had Whigfield, I was feeling Bill Withers
And to this day I'm still with him
Because nothing beats a sweet voice on distilled rhythms

I'm digging up my roots for you
Cooking up a little tuneful food
Come to the garden for a barbecue
And chill with me

Before I even saw South Park on TV
I know by heart the South Park CD
GTA: 1969 opened a life long affinity for Trojan
Return of Django, Skinhead Moonstomp
Music of Jamaican origin liberating my boom box
Too young for Appetite for Destruction
So The Offspring were my rock introduction
That was all I needed to be free
A CD with some power chords shredding like a power saw
"Fuck me, wow" I thought
How can plucked strings be this powerful?
But then I found another source of auditory debauchery
This naughty teen though was sweet
I bought a CD by an emineMC
Called "Hi! My Name Is Slim Shady"
I played it on my hi-fi daily
It never seemed to cease to amaze me
He'd say some crazy things
That were great for a teenager that needed danger
I'd replay the lyrics amazed
At the way the images would flicker inside my brain so vivdly
An outsider, a country bumpkin
Sitting inside with the Outsidaz bumping
There's something about the rhymes
Nothing else quite does as well, I love it
Cypress Hill: Live at the Fillmore
I'm not going to lie, that film was raw
Each rap I heard, each film I saw
Inspired me to build my skills some more
So I bought more CDs to imitate
Believe me, back in the day it was great


I had piano lessons after every school day
But my patience was thinner than an anorexic
I didn't want to play ballads anyway
I had a daydream of breakbeats and a pen and paper
So I said I'd make the make believe real
And make some real reel to reels like B-real
But the magic's made on computers today
So I used Magix Music Maker
Read the instructions, learnt all the book
Taught myself big beats like Norman Cook
Always cooking up a new track
Though with no microphone I couldn't actually do rap
That was too bad, but it wasn't too bad
Cause I'd already forgot and had a new fad
Threw away The Source, bought a new mag
Made new mates, talked in a new slang
I was a punk rocker now, proper loud
Would you believe I grabbed the opportunity to fuck about?
But what about the music? I've gone and lost it now
So I grabbed a guitar and started rocking out
Made a band with my mates called Matrons Apron
We played around, made some tapes it was great fun
Full of belly laughs
Even received a brief mention in the Telegraph
Just a couple of kids, played a couple of gigs
And then my mated moved on but fuck if I did
Obviously too late, got a copy of Cubase
A lot of tunes made, now it's today
I've innovated, took my inspirations in and made them
Into an original addition to you playlist
So now I meditate about how to elevate
Cause Safe was just the safety net to let me levitate
I'm picking my best fruit for you
You're the one, and I'd like tea for two
Come to the garden for a barbecue
And chill with me




 Hello, it's Dan Bull
Some of you know this already but a while ago I was diagnosed with quite a severe allergy to Broccoli
But uh, quite a bit of time has passed since then and I might have developed an immunity
Let's find out
That's all right

They call me Douglby
I tackle issues like ruggleby
A blend of gentlemanliness and thuggery
I'll glass you with some very expensive bubbly
Bloody luxury
Bone cutlery protrudes from your wounds
Buggery
Ooh!
A scrummage
Lovely jubbly
A useful excuse to induce you to cuddle me
The two teams squeeze together quite snugly
Rummaging and fumbling with undiscovered subtlety
Beneath the scrummaging we're being all couply
I'm roughly as politically correct as little Huckleberry Finn using epithets
No longer customary
I'll get with your ex then apply for custody
Of your little buggers then we'll bugger off to Tuscany
I'm in your cuff links and tux living comfortably
Bloody luxury, being you - sucks to being

Whether you rap
Whether you rock
Or whether you roll
I insist that you relinquish all control
We're playing rugby and the ball's your soul
So pass it back to Dougbly and we'll all go home

Rap's raconteur back on tour
I'll blap a crap reviewer
Sacre bleu
That's one fewer wrongdoer
I'm long due an apology
And I want you to give one to me
If you ever listened to a rapper
And it wasn't me
I'll pull off my trackie bottoms
And give you a tracheotomy
I'll leave you looking like a child eating broccoli
Ticking you off saying
"Chew your food properly"
I operate a strict sick lyrics only policy
So originality's a pretty big priority
I lyrically precede the Iliad and Odyssey
They found my lyric pad within a Celtic monastery
Follow Gilgamesh's geneology through ptolemy
Anyone of quality, they probably just copied me
So are my sonnets prophecy or an anomaly?
A little bit of column A, a bit of column B

Whether you rap
Whether you rock
Or whether you roll
I insist that you relinquish all control
We're playing rugby and the ball's your soul
So pass it back to Dougbly and we'll all go home




 Where are my trousers?
Where are my trousers?

One morning I woke up with such a bad head
I thought I'd been hit by a tow truck (smack) no such luck
Look down and notice that I'm wearing no top
No socks and no trousers, oh fock
Bits and bobs jiggling around so much
I'm a walking promotion for Botox
How did I get here? Why am I naked?
I better grab a rock and decide what my fate is

I'm just a naked man, running around, baby
Hold on a minute, I'm a little overwhelmed
I'm just a naked man, running around, baby
Hold on a minute, what's that rustling sound?

Said, how did I get here? Why am I naked?
I better grab a rock and decide what my fate is
I put the pieces together like Kojak
A bit of wood and a bit of stone is a stone axe
What a throwback, Homo erectus
Hope you know Latin 'cause I'm whacking your solar plexus
Stay away from my camp, you and your mans ran in
Crafting and aiming at you with a hand cannon
Defending my base, I stand on my feet
I'm nude but you won't get your hands on my meat
I'm planning to eat, build bigger, better houses
But for now I guess I better get a pair of trousers

I'm just a naked man, running around
Hold on a minute, baby, look what I've found
I'm just a naked man, running around, baby
Hold on a minute, what's that rustling sound?

Shh, I'm a bare man fighting a bear, man
I don't need bare man, I do it with my bare hands
I'm gonna track a deer, follow the hoof prints
Till I come across a box full of blueprints
Now I can do things like a civilized man
But I'll still kill anything that moves with the thing in my hand
It's been a nice chat but I'm still gonna stick a knife in the guy's back
Don't trust anybody, not even your best friend
It's an act, better put it on the West End
Let's not pretend, human nature has changed, man
Still naked, behaving like a caveman

I'm just a naked man, running around
Hold on a minute, why's there blood on the ground?
I'm just a naked man, running around, baby
Hold on a minute, what's that rustling, rustling sound?




 Rome, the place I name as my home
Made it my own and I’ll die before I see it overthrown
I’m one of the most valiant fighters
I’m known as Marius Titus
This city’s in my blood
As valuable as my life is
With all of the troops, Legions at hand
We’re ruling a huge region of land
Reaching through France and even Britannia
And for that, we’ve Caesar to thank
For seizing it and I think of the man
When I’m leading a siege and I see that the ranks
Are in need of command, eager to mangle
A people as weak as we are grand
Ryse...

This isn’t my kind of war
The thing that I’m fighting for
Gibbon’s Decline and Fall
Didn’t begin describing all
The wicked things that Titus saw
His sight is raw, his eyes are sore
Lives withdrawn with violent force
Civilian killing with knives and swords
Now my kids and wife are torn asunder
Souls all but plundered
I hunger for vengeance on the men responsible
I’ve called their number
I’m a lord of thunder
Striding right in with the force and might
Of lightning strikes, I will never bore or tire
Of war or fighting
RYSE!
Welcome to the next generation!




 I've hungered enough for the humblest stuff
From running the country to just someone to love
But enough is enough, I'm done with the world
So I'll succumb and return us to the substance we come from
We see bubbles above the submarine
As I plunge us deep, three-hundred leagues under the sea
There's a feeling of release as as our feelings are released
And we feel immediately at peace
It's less easy to see as the light fades
And my face is emblazoned with night's shade
I wait as the sides of the ride shake
And vibrate like they're portraying my mindstate
I'm inside, safe, encased in a cocoon
But soon it'll take my life away
But I made the choice to die today
So I may aswell enjoy the ride
Man, you are spoiled and you've
Thrown your toys out the pram
It's these moments of silliness
That spoil it for every two one
No longer am I looking into the sky
I'm seeing into your eye




 Howdy neighbours
What a lovely sunny and uncloudy day it is
Come down to our side of town, smell the flavours
Barbecues, car fumes, cannabis vapours
Skyscrapers cast shadows in chromatic rays
Upon some players hanging in a cul-de-sac in San Andreas
We're all a pack of wolves in a gang, Amadeus
I'm CJ back in town for some retaliation
Reluctantly, I'm happy on the PlayStation
Vacation on occasion, waste my days away and blaze a spliff
Oh great I'm late, I need to get my date a gift
I could either leave and drop you off here
Or me and you could tea for two
And we can brew some hot coffee

Big up, Sweet
Big up Big Smoke
Big up Grove Street
OG Loc
The gang from the West Coast
Rising up the ranks won't stop
'til we run Los Santos

Check out my BMX, it's really rad
I'm finna hit a ramp and wheely off the top of Mount Chiliad
Land it smack dab in the middle of a helipad
Chump, that's a jump you'll never trump, very sad
I'll insane stunts on them
Grab a punk
If he's acting arrogant, I'll have him shook like a can of Sprunk
Hey, you're bringing brass knuckles in the place?
I might have to slap a shovel in your face
Run away to a safe place, say your prayers
Or should I pull an AK? Want to take it there?
Nah, you're a chicken, you should tuck your tail
And run to cover with the others up in Cluckin' Bell
CJ thieving rampantly
So if you leave your keys around
I'll steal your Banshee and I'll leave you bleeding rapidly
Feeling the fantasy of being in a family of street gangstas
Packing heat, we're not about to leave in handcuffs

Big up, Sweet
Big up Big Smoke
Big up Grove Street
OG Loc
The gang from the West Coast
Rising up the ranks won't stop
'til we run Los Santos

I'm CJ back in town for some retaliation
I got a loyalty voucher from Ammu-Nation
The police, they know me well down the station
I'm officer Tenpenny's full time vocation
Yo, I'm going to go find a lowrider
Big pimping, I'm a ho provider
See the kingdom of the Grove Street rise up
Rolling over po po in a stolen Rhino
Hijack a flight, have a right good time
Might fly through the Vinewood sign
I'm a violent type with a Tec-9
I'm going to get mine
Step over the live and there won't be a next time
I don't just run a red light
I run a Red Light District, I'm a headline
Because every single thing I said rhymes
White chalk on the sidewalk, that's a deadline

Big up, Sweet
Big up Big Smoke
Big up Grove Street
OG Loc
The gang from the West Coast
Rising up the ranks won't stop
'til we run Los Santos
Big up, Sweet
Big up Big Smoke
Big up Grove Street
OG Loc
The gang from the West Coast
Rising up the ranks won't stop
'til we run Los Santos

Ramiro Cortez
A hero caught
In the middle of an era of war
Or a dark assassin
With a darker past
Who will start to blast
Before you’re part of the action
Try to match your reaction to him
Don’t make me laugh
You’ll be trash in the bin
How are you going to handle a man
With the stamina to run
From the west of Alaska through Canada?
Who’s up next?
Let’s flip the damn switch
*Click*
And it’s Victor Dantrix
Using military skill to his advantage
Putting a finish
To your tricks and antics
You’re in a bit of a pickle
Fix a sandwich
As I rap so fast
It’s a different language
Vocals roaming the globe when I say
That Stonewall’s only a phone call away
So when

There’s an outbreak
A scourge
Get your weapon drawn
It’s not a metaphor
Better call Echo Squad
There’s an outbreak
A scourge
Get your weapon drawn
It’s not a metaphor
Better call Echo Squad

Mass
James Lang
Ex-SAS
If he asks for a hand
Then you best say yes
Scotland is the land that he’s from
And as a result
He can toss you with one hand
I’m referring to cabers
Not glands
The only thing he’s wacking off
Is a shotgun
Solid as a rock man
With a dangerous secret
So you better pray that he keeps it
Tarn’s not the NSA
But if you leak it
Your face’ll need a re-fit
Slapping you
Smack in the face so hard
That the glass of your mask
It’d crack and then shatter
And make those shards
The slow-mo part of the trailer
Your brain’s going to know by heart
Don’t try this at home in a scuffle
You’ll damage the bone in your knuckle
She’s a Russian-American emigrant
Burnt by chemicals
The depression is evident
Mind messed up
Like the pallor of her melanin
Never mind feminine
Never mind heroine
Her enemies better be clever
Whenever they get her
‘cause she’ll end the five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten of them
You’ll have to find another set
Of hired guys
With the Firefly
It’s like
“bye bye!”

There’s an outbreak
A scourge
Get your weapon drawn
It’s not a metaphor
Better call Echo Squad
There’s an outbreak
A scourge
Get your weapon drawn
It’s not a metaphor
Better call Echo Squad
Failure is not an option




 Ahoy, mateys
Lovely day

Ahhhhhhhh
There's nothing like a life at sea
Breathe in the briny breeze, you'll never feel quite as free
A perfect day for paddling, so come and dive with me
I wear a pair of peg legs to hide the fact I'm five foot three
There lurks a sight to see, beneath the gleaming surface
That just happens to be here like it was on purpose
But a pirate's only duty's answering the call of booty
Through all the beauty, mutiny, the loot and the appalling cruelty
You won't have a long life expectancy
I mean respectfully, what do you expect at sea?
When you're stepping in a grapeshot's trajectory
It's balls meet balls, what a mess of a vasectomy

On Devil's Ridge beneath the sands
The gold lies hidden from thieving hands
Seek the cursed boar shrine where there is no sky
It lies in wait for a light held high

Where's the treasure hiding on this desert island?
Guess we'd better find them
But these skeleton fellows are intending to pile in
Well if they want to pile in, we'll leave them in a pile
In a heap, we reamed them into pieces like a hymen
Jesus, even I can't believe the things I'm rhyming
Blame my rhyming dictionary, because it isn't very -
Stop to admire the view and have a bit of fruit
It's not just ammo that the cannon here can shoot

On Devil's Ridge beneath the sands
The gold lies hidden from thieving hands
Seek the cursed boar shrine where there is no sky
It lies in wait for a light held high

Now that the time's arrived to head into the cave
I'm suddenly not feeling so particularly brave
So it's lucky, lucky for me that I'm with my mates
I'll just stay here at the back to guarantee we can escape
Yeah, I'll just look at these pictures, you go ahead
Umm, you alright in there, bro? Oh, he's dead
Hold your lantern high, behold the rancid sight
If I were you I'd take a moment to ensure your pants are dry

On Devil's Ridge beneath the sands
The gold lies hidden from thieving hands
Seek the cursed boar shrine where there is no sky
It lies in wait for a light held high

I'm sure your chest ought to be somewhere northwest
More or less over there, below the floor, I guess
Aww yes! Let's get it, leg it and do one
Before the skeleton's get a sniff and tear us a new one
Do you want to be one like sailors in the past have
No? Then run away, no one's invented satnavs
Left, right, up, down, it doesn't matter, what's the diff'?
You've got no option, so just fricking bomb it off the cliff
Plummet into rock pools, I'm not gonna stop, fools
I've got jewels and my crew's got tools
What you gonna do, you're too skinny to be starting trouble, fellows
Back to the ship in a jiffy, quick, we're parked on double yellows
I swear, every time we check the map, we get attacked
And when I work out who keeps doing that, they'll get a slap
I've only just redecorated in my cabin
Grabbing some ammo, then get straight into the cannon
Hit the deck of a ship that's wrecked, showing disrespect
Whip out my pistol, blast the captain into bits of flesh
There's nothing like the stench of singed gunpowder, it's the best
Ah, so this is why they call this middle deck the mess
You should switch the decor up in here, I've got a bit depressed
I'd better ditch and jet to collect the biggest cheque
Hoist the main sails, man the tiller, wheel or rudder
We're feeling good and -
Wait, come back! Oh bugger

On Devil's Ridge beneath the sands
The gold lies hidden from thieving hands
Seek the cursed boar shrine where there is no sky
It lies in wait for a light held high

Captain?
Ai-ain't those lyrics copyrighted from the game or so'e'ing?
Well yes, they probably are
But what do you expect?
We're pirates!




 December the 25th is here
0.003% of a year
December the 25th is here
So we should shine a light on those who might just disappear

There's so much hype for the 25th of December
Piles of cards to write, lists of gifts to remember
That we're quick to forget, amidst the tinsel and splendour
That in the end we're in it together
So I've picked up a pen and written a letter
But it isn't to Santa
Though it is a wishlist of things I think we should remember
Of thinkers, inventors, figures and mentors
And different events linked to the 25th of December, listen:
William the Conqueror was crowned the King of England
Ukraine chose to leave the Soviet Union
In ancient Rome was Charlemagne's coronation
Later, the Kingdom of Hungary's foundation
Hong Kong succumbed to Japanese occupation
The Soviet Union saw Gorbachev's resignation
Christmas Island found by Captain William Mynors
The adoption of The Constitution of the Republic of China
This is for Isaac Newton, I salute him
The guy who kickstarted the scientific revolution
Helena Rubinstein, Polish-American businesswoman
They're all omitted with this discussion of Christmas coming
Isn't it something?
And if you're into cricket
Happy birthday Trescothick, Hasan, Jones, Cook and Grimmet
Let's remember Quentin Crisp, Lady Morgan Sydney
Orlando Gibbons, Jinnah, Robert Ripley
The day that comedy died, this isn't happening
First W. C. Fields, then Charlie Chaplin
This is for Hugo Bergmann and Dorothy Wordsworth
The German Nobel laureates Ruska, Windaus and Herzberg
From generousness to effortless cleverness
Respect to Annie Lennox, Noel Redding, Kenny Everett
The efforts and achievements real people do
Whether or not they succeed
Rest in peace, Beagle 2
Here's looking at you, admidst the stars I have to thank you
Tip my hat to Humphrey Bogart, the star of Casablanca
From Cab Calloway through to Louis Chevrolet
There's plenty more we ought to make sure we don't forget today

Love you
We love you
Love you
We love you, love you
Love you
We love you
Love you
We love you

Not many of us have a larger heart than
The founder of the American Red Cross, Clara Barton
So I beg your pardon for any omission
Whether you're a secularist or whether you're Christian
Whatever religion, whatever your differences
We're distant relatives so let us mend the division
Within gender, we're more than just men and just women
We may be different races but we're genetically kin and
We may be different ages but we still live
In the same seconds and minutes
No one's setting the limits
So let's end the tradition of splitting hairs
'Cause the fission of follicles just isn't logical
Remember the mission
We're in it together

We love you
Love you
We love you, love you
Love you
We love you
Love you
We love you, love you
Love you (love you)
We love you
Love you (love you)
We love you, love you
Love you (love you)
We love you
Love you (love you)
We love you




 I have a confession to make
There's no easy way to say this, so...
I'll just put it out there
I've... I've sold out
It's brilliant!

In year 7 at school I remember that all I aimed to be
Was a professional rapper, gamer or comedian
Well guess what, mate? (yea?) Today I'm all three of them
And we're saving up for payments to replace my faulty eardrums
I aspired to be "Eminem meets Monty Python"
With enough cash stockpiled to live my life on
And now I'm getting there I tell myself: "nice one"
While trolls send descriptions of the illness I should die from
Hello, is anybody home? Turn the lights on
Why do you think that you can tell me what to do in my song?
Don't construct a moral code that you expect me to adhere to
You're a mere shrew in a field of views
So I can't even hear you
Your opinion doesn't mean a thing to me
If I'd have listened to it, I wouldn't be in this industry
Wouldn't have made the friends I share a passion with
Travel with, make videos and have a stack of fun just rapping with

To make a living playing games? Hell yeah!
To make a living saying things? Hell yeah!
To start my day by writing rhymes? Hell yeah!
To never work a 9 to 5? Hell yeah!
To be my own manager? Hell yeah!
To get rich off what I did when I was amateur?
I'm the one that's doing things, the rest of you are talking
How can I have sold out? I never bought in

I rarely make a love song, prefer dropping lovebombs
But when it's time to spar, I'm the first to put the gloves on
Life is a prize fight for a shine of the limelight
And I'm loving every round of it, the Mike Tyson of my life
I remember dreading a 9 to 5, suit and tie
Talk about doing time, this was do or die
Socially acceptable type of suicide
Why should you or I let a single other human being rule our life
Life is an RPG, and we need more than XP
So larp with me; I won't charge a fee if you impress me
Do it deftly and there's no end to what you can get free
I love to chase success, I state that expressly
I've never compromised my mission or integrity
My mission is to do whatever I think's best for me
Eventually I'll write lyrics on flipping everything
Meanwhile I'll take a check to give the list a bit of editing

To make a living playing games? Hell yeah!
To make a living saying things? Hell yeah!
To start my day by writing rhymes? Hell yeah!
To never work a 9 to 5? Hell yeah!
To be my own manager? Hell yeah!
To get rich off what I did when I was amateur?
I'm the one that's doing things, the rest of you are talking
How can I have sold out? I never bought in

I'm not the Wolf of Wall Street
I'm just a Bull that's balls deep
In every opportunity for improvement I see before me
A song with product placement creates a complication
Even when accompanied by an honest statement
And if I want to be an honored statesman
I've got to make it proper blatant
So I'm only going to say it once:
My songs are entertainment, they're not a concrete statement
And if you take a rap track as fact, then you are mistaken
I'm not endorsing shit, unless I say it's good
I never have and never will tell a fib in exchange for paper
Perhaps your perspective would be turned round
If you'd assessed the prospective shit that I had turned down
I've spurned thousands of pounds from powerful people
'cause I found out just how they're treating creatures and it isn't peaceful
So, to all my critics and my haters, God bless
I'm not a sellout, nah, I'm a success

To make a living playing games? Hell yeah!
To make a living saying things? Hell yeah!
To start my day by writing rhymes? Hell yeah!
To never work a 9 to 5? Hell yeah!
To be my own manager? Hell yeah!
To get rich off what I did when I was amateur?
I'm the one that's doing things, the rest of you are talking
How can I have sold out? I never bought in




 I, wander
I wander
I, wander
I wander

I wander lost alone
Far from home
You've got so far to roam
How can you go back
When you don't know where you started?
No
Crumbling rocks and stones
Crush your bones
The hardest blow
Is not the conflict
But the conflicted quandary
Your heart is loaded with
Pulling you apart from within
Nothing can grow in the garden of sin
And hidden in you hand
Is a key to the forbidden land
You've been here before
But feel like starting again

This is a rebirth
A regeneration
A throwback
The tail of the lizard
Stronger when it grows back
So, slice your sword through the light
Hold it aloft
Cut a hole through the sky
The shadow of the colossus
I, wander
I wander
I, wander
The shadow of the colossus

Get off my back
Get off my back
Get off my back
Get off my back
See nature reclaiming the ancient sacred shrines
Making time and space entwined
Changing up the pacing of your frame of mind
Can't hide from fate
I'm facing mine
Want to fight me?
Wait in line
I'm taking my bow and aiming high
Feather and cane decorating the sky
Whatever problem personally pursues you
Posed on any scale
Perserverence
Plus persistence
Persistently prevail
It's a tale as old
As the mountain and peninsula
Your impediments will harden
As long as they're kept insular
That's why it's vital
That you fight for every inch
Of the particular predicament
That's pricking
Digging in your rib
And prickling you skin
Ripping you apart from within
Nothing can flourish in the garden of sin
And hidden in you hand
Is the key to the forbidden land
You've been here before
But feel like starting again

This is a rebirth
A regeneration
A throwback
The tail of the lizard
Stronger when it grows back
So, slice your sword through the light
Hold it aloft
Cut a hole through the sky
The shadow of the colossus
I, wander
I wander
I, wander
The shadow of the colossus

Get off my back, get off my back
Get off my back, get off my back
Get off my back, get off my back
Get off my back, get off my back
Get off my back, get off my back
Get off my back, get off my back

The mightiest axe
Is to a leviathan but tiny daggers
But it's not the size that matters
It's striking fast
With the right attack
As you find that light on the Titan's back
And drive in the knife 'til it staggers
The night is alive with the sound
Of the lightning pounding the ground
As the giant crashes
Lying dormant
The lying dormin
Light and dark
Eye and horn
In dying dawn
Now I am mourning
For the higher form
I thought was a guiding light
Through the dire door
To the trial hall
Of my final calling
All to find that I have fallen
Waterfall dweller
I'm a sort a door-to-door seller
Port of call:
Fellows that are forty four foot tall
Hello
I brought a sword
For the inevitable awesome brawl
Hella enormous proportions
Result in the portions of gore
That'd cause a pool
That could hold a whole Portuguese man o' war
Without folding its knees
Or whatever those damn dangly organs are called
Stinging
Wringing you apart from within
Salting the earth
Halting rebirth of the garden of sin
And hidden in your hand
Is a key to the forbidden land
You've been here before
But feel like starting again

This is a rebirth
A regeneration
A throwback
The tail of the lizard
Stronger when it grows back
So, slice your sword through the light
Hold it aloft
Cut a hole through the sky
The shadow of the colossus
I, wander
I wander
I, wander
The shadow of the colossus




 I log onto Facebook sometimes
And it's telling me your gallery's updated but five
Hundred of your pictures are the same, it looks like
You're pissed up every day with your mates at club nights
And I hate to be uptight, but I just find
It a shame you're afraid of the sunlight
And why do people never quite look like
Their profile picture they pick for the front?
Why it's funny what the camera does to you
That must be why you're stood by someone fatter and uglier
So you look better in comparison, but it's apparent that
You're shallow and that that's what you've done here
Nah - you look absolutely fabulous
So let's have a game of Scrabulous
Mafia Wars! Mafia Wars!
How many times do I have to click ignore?
I didn't want to play it when you asked me before
So what the hell are you still asking me for?
If only there was an application
That let me smash your face in

600 million people like me like this
Are you taking the piss?
Or is there something I've missed?

Attempting a Facebook Chat's neverending
It says this forever: "sending... sending..."
Exactly after you've said something
Regretful it's essential it gets corrected
Like: I was chatting to my friend and said this
"Let's get together, for a bevvy this weekend, Chris"
But cos it only sent the first section
He gets the impression there's sexual tension
Now there's an extra dimension to friendship
I didn't expect, and flipping heck did I mention
I hate the rate of your inane status updates
I couldn't give a (pop) you've just baked some cupcakes
If you wouldn't tell me in the pub to my face
Why would I want it cluttering my front page?
Some days I'm amazed to witness
The shitness of other people's daily business
And I'm sick with these lazy idiots:
"I lost my phone, can you post up your digits?"
They say if it exists, there's porn of it
Well now there's also a Facebook wall for it
"If a million people join this group
Then I'll call my first born boy Sue"
"Oi you, are you coming to my concert?"
"Well I would, but I'm on another continent"
Every time I log on there's a berk
Who's certain he's an entrepeneur. Sir
You don't understand, I won't become a fan
Of your club promoter brand or Stones cover band
If you're looking for fans you need another plan
Stop spamming us with your rubbish ads
On the other hand, if you're watching this
Click on the link and become a fan of Dan

It must be productively harmful
When there's less farmers on farms than on Farmville
"I'm milking a cash cow for sheep, wanna buy some?"
I'm thrilled, can you see my excitement?
These ads are leaving me frightened
How can they see I need my teeth whitened?
Now the security's been tightened
It's even easier to peek at your private
Details, "just provide us your e-mail
We'll make your penis three times the size"
And hiding's not an option, this is social
Global is the new local
Applications, invitations
Poking, open relations
If it's a complicated situation
You won't fix it with switching your status
Suggesting I add a lad that went to my class
I haven't met since reception, why dredge up the past?
"We should reconnect, we haven't spoke in a while"
I know, that's cause I find you totally vile
If we met now, we'd both run a mile
So why's this bloke on my file?
Next time I'm asked "what's on my mind?"
I might just click in the box and reply:

 I'm having trouble with Google+
Cause I don't know who to trust
Twitter? Facebook? Two's enough
Do we need another place for stupid stuff?
Remember MySpace?
It was a nice place
'til Facebook made it a giant waste
Now MySpace Tom uses Google
So it's clear which one's more useful
1 + 1 is 2
But if you only get one +1
It's poo
Lots of filters for content anew
But there's not one that tells us
What bit is true
It's doubtful to me
I can helpfully glean that
From the crap moving up and down on my screen
I've run out of steam
With the amount in my stream
But in cyberspace, who can tell when you scream?
600,000,000 people like me

My social ties are total lies
But I'm too tied in
To show you why
I'm totally fly when I socialize
I've got a bigger Circle
Than the goatse guy
Though, I'm uncertain how Circles work
Is it some kind of circle jerk?
Cause it seems to me
That the Hangout
Is just a place for good mates
To get their wang out
Hang about, I don't want to stand out
I'm just trying to protect my ring
Like Gandalf
And nowadays, staying private's an art
Michelangelo's David's private parts
Couldn't be more on the view than you
So I might as well use my googlies
As a Google Doodle
When Google doesn't know
What I'm Googling
They know my shoe size
My bowel movements
And the mood I'm in
The bits I miss
When I do the hoovering
And with whom I'm canoodling
Never mind recycling
Move me to the loony bin
If Google's the future
Then losers are Übermensch

I check out my Twitter feed occasionally
And the shit I see's basically make believe
Peeps claim it's the place to be
But that amazes me, because it tastes of wee
All the food for thought here's the sort to damage you
If it was a restaurant, I'd talk to the manager
Quick, Twitpic, you should have brought your camera
Now breaking a story's a sport for amateurs
And if it's a case of the more the merrier
How witty can you be in 140 characters?
In the days of broadband, I really would have thought that you could have more than that
"Dan, give up the ridiculous voice because you're missing the point
And you're a twat!"
Fair enough, that's freedom of speech
But I wouldn't have thought that from reading your tweets
Cause each of them seems to be equally meaningless sequences of ceaseless frequency
So could you please have the decency to give your private life a tiny bit of secrecy?


Once upon a time I was fond of Dom Joly
Before I saw him come across as a dumb wally
He can't cope with the folks that provoke him
And so now Dom's gone off his damn trolley
And that's the folly of the modern celebrity
Act like a twat and everybody sees
I try to be nice, but my mind's in a cycle
Of retweets, e-heaps of shite to recycle
But aside from the gripes it's a quite good site
Though a far flight from the times of the typewriter
Typing "lol looks like a TIE Fighter"
Can acquire more followers than the Pied Piper
My favorite pastime is pasting the @ sign
Before peoples' names and then making up crap rhymes
Aw, that's nice
Nah, I'm just another gasbag with a hashtagged gag in the tagline
You might be thinking "Dan leave", I try
But I keep coming back like Stephen Fry
For a sneak peek into Mr. Bieber's life
From the feedback you'd see that he's the Messiah
But if Jesus Christ preached gospel on Twitter
I believe that the Bible'd be a lot thicker
Even the scribes couldn't even describe
With e-readers, they need to jot quicker
What literary miscellany is there if there's any
We can literally lift from the litany of lists
That are littered ten a penny through the interwebby?
It's a very, very, very, very, little bit shit, innit?




 This is a city that's gritty
It isn't just pretty shitty
There's a contagion that's making people feel a little iffy
Brains on the pavement
I say that's making statement
About the way that the state has just laid us to waste
And up we pan
This woman is pushing a pram
But I'm in a rush, She's going to get rammed
You may think I'm a sick man
But it's a game of survival
And nick can
My aim is to stay alive or
Invade this plague of rivals
I'm a late arrival
And I'd like to trade for a great big rifle
It's the end of days so take your bible
Straight to the final page and cry
Or maybe try to slay these guys and ladies
In a blazing fireball
It's frightful
When I stick a fork or a knife in your eyeball
Have you tried the pie?
It's to die for
It's not my fault
There's this irritating prick and he's attached to my car
Lean to the passenger side
He's getting smacked with a bar
I'm a maximum action star
But now I've crashed and I'm trapped in my car
What happened? I've an awful head
I'm sure I've been here before in the walking dead
I crawl out on the floor with dread
The horde intent
To maul me then perform a gross post mortem, zen
In the moment I call an end to it
I'll paint this town all in red
With gore instead
A brush with death
Hand me my palette and my canvas
Where are we dorothy?
Well, I'll be damned if it's kansas
Looking for the answers at the bottom of a barrel
I'll think you'll look more dashing
With blood spots on your apparel
And her?
She's a feral creep, she
Resembled cheryl tweedy
Now she's more meryl streep
With the devil's teeth
And her hair all greasy
Who the fuck shot me in the back?
He's a big bastard and he's plotting to attack
Planning on merking us all
So I'm grabbing a circular saw
And I won't let the hell end
'Till you bellends are purple and sore
We'd better dash and hide inside the garage
And hope they won't crash in like a lifeless Nigel Farage
We need to build something awesome before we go to fight
How about a motherfucking roller motorbike?
This is amazing
Wrecking and Riding
Ripping and Blazing
Dead violent
This is amazing
Wrecking and Riding
Ripping and Blazing
Dead Rising (x3)




 Good day to all Americans
I'm here with a catastrophe
And a number of questions to one I'm hoping will answer these
My name is Shizzy Sixx with the DB6 News

And I'm Dan Bull, here to discuss the issues

OK, recently it seems America caused a blunder
Fallen under, suffered
The reason why is what we all have wondered

Capitol Hill were meant to passing a bill
About how America was splashing mils
But they were lacking the skill
Lagging until it was too late and shut down

But now that it's shutdown and sundown
Dan, what now?

Well, first an urgent purge of federal workers
Essential ones will stay, the rest will be worthless

Along with being worthless, with hungry mouths and stress
Do you have any idea how many people it'll affect?

Well, 800,000 are not deemed essential
So their diaries are gonna be real uneventful

The eventual tears will be a lot to see
What exactly will this do the economy?

We will see a drop in stocks and profits immediately
The longer it goes on, the more it eats into the GDP

Dropping quick as a DDT, I can't help but feel choked up
Dan, since you're in the office, care to explain what's the hold up?

Yeah, of course
The Democrats are in a never-ending spat
With the Republicans on just how to spend their tax

And because that, we can't relax
There's drama here
Care to tell me what that has to do with Obamacare?

Well, some Republicans believe that social healthcare
Is so bad for welfare, they're ready to go out there
This is nail-biting stuff for Obama's cuticles
And equally key play for major pharmaceuticals

Seems for some of these guys, being in office is unsuitable
I'd rather see them clean cars and never see a cubicle
I'm sorry, I'm just enraged and took a slight detour
Now my next question is: has this happened before?

The last shutdown was nearly 20 years ago, lasting 21 days
So this appears to show that it could take a serious amount of time
To resolve what's a fuss about a dime

Which is a shame, it's like a game
With our funds is being played
But during the whole fiasco, does the President get paid?

Yep
The President's still getting sent a paycheck
With everyone in Congress, it's a safe bet

At this point, I just feel that America neglects me
But just to be sure, how does this whole thing affect me?

Well, in many ways you won't be left on your own
But won't be able to get a passport or federal loan
But despite the major changes that we're sure to see
It won't affect national or social security

Well, I suppose that's a positive, diminishing the shame
But the biggest question here is:
Who are we to blame?

Yeah, who's responsible for digging this hole?
Well, opinion polls suggest them in control of Congress
While about 10% less
Blame the President for getting us into this bloody mess

Well Dan, I appreciate you taking out the time
To elighten us here at DB6 at five, now
We wait to see if we're out of luck now
Or if power returns to the system to end this...
SHUTDOWN

 I was born way back in 1986
I'm an old man now
But I remember how it used to be
Any now my grandchildren ask me
Granddad they say
Can you tell us what it was like
In the days of the Internet
You know, before SOPA
And I'd tell them

When was that? Hmm, let me see
Some time back in the early 21st century
I remember when the Internet was FREE
Behind my keyboard, people let me be
See, there used to be a thing called Freedom of Speech
We had freedom to teach each other, freedom to preach
Freedom to share culture and circulate ideas
Without the state trying to interfere, enter fear
We lost that freedom, not freedom as in free beer
But the freedom to be free from fear, even here
In the United Kingdom, the fact that I'm from England
Isn't a matter that matters to our new masters and kings
I was a chap who could sing and distribute my music
And like minded citizens could listen to it
I couldn't afford an orchestra, I was a poor performer
In more ways than one so I sought an alternate formula
Reinterpreted the media around me
Satirized the leaders' lies on found beats
Talked shop on top of a sample of a rock band
At least we used to, until rap got banned

At the SOPA
SOPA Cabana
The place where SOPA
SOPA can ban ya
We're At the SOPA
SOPA Cabana
The place where SOPA
SOPA can ban ya

You didn't have to act twisted to get your ass blacklisted
Just annoy a big business and get fisted
They had a vested interest in Congress
If one messed with them, then there'd be one less
Our representatives never represented shit
So the internet was history, this was the end of it
I remember it like it was yesterday
I guess that day, I was too lazy to investigate
The escapades of another state's government
Now I'm left to pay because the covenant
That they signed that day and ratified in law
Zipped our mouths up and took away our appetite for more!
I can't do much now about the way it is
But if I could go back and change things I'd say this
Truth is beauty
At least it used to be
And if you disagree with my views
Then you can sue me
In the meantime I'll keep using YouTube
Even if it means that I need to find a new medium
IRC, Darknets, so digital's down now?
I'll use pigeons and smoke signals




 I'm stranded in space
So I place my hands on my face
Did you guess
This isn't a situation I can handle with grace?
Nevertheless, Dan's on the case
And I never pander to tastes
In case they change like the range of animals and plants in this place
I've visited all different corners of the Galaxy
There isn't any flora and fauna that I haven't seen
I'm interplanetary
Always in thrall of the random scenes
Tangerines
Dreams
You'll never see such things in your National Geographic magazine
Grab a bit of cobblestone
Carry it and hobble home
Boulders on my shoulders and I'm sorry for my collarbone
But I've got to build a model home
I don't want it to be monochrome
Colours light my life when I'm on my own
If I can't craft with it, I don't want to know
I don't want to, no
Oh, what a homophone

Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now
Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now

I'm a hip hopper
Got a disk in my shiplocker
Might be fly, swap a wing for a pig trotter
Tick tock
Plot thickening to get hotter
Planet calling Daniel, I think I need an ink blotter
You're full of gas like a Novakid
Aww, did I make you sad?
Well I hope I did
I'm cooking up a plan and I'm about to blow the lid
Although there's nothing in the pan so don't open it
So hungry
So hungry
I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy
So hungry
I'm so hungry
I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy
Yummy
Brineapple pie, Neonmelon and a Pineapple
Pine for a Coralcreep
Curry
Curry
I'm so hungry
I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy

Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now
Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now

I need to explore
I've got an aching feeling, the call:
The Universe is waiting
This is a race for the mineral and ore
Love the thrill of the chase so I'm winning in the war
Love Dreadwing Penguin
I pin him to the floor with a minimum of effort
Then I'm ready for some more
I need to explore
I've got an aching feeling, the call:
The Universe is waiting
Every Galaxy is a snowflake
Floating in the sky like an island, no fake
This is a fact; it's actual
Zoom in and in and in
And interact with the fractal
Every snowflake is a Galaxy
Floating in the sky like an eye looking back at me
This is a fact; it's actual
Zoom in and in and in
And interact with the fractal

Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now
Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now




 Tell me - do you believe in fate?
Do you believe that we each have a fee to pay
And a leaving date with no hope to deviate
That our breathing rate ceases when we reach this age?
Where do we go when we leave this place?
Is it nowhere where nobody can see your face?
There's no need to kneel on your knees and pray
Cos seasons change so it may be today
Looking back on the one life I've had on this Earth
This planet, this world, I sit back and I ponder
I have become fond of the fact I've lasted this long
Though in the past I've done wrong and my battery's gone
Will things be any different here after I'm gone?
Will anybody listen to my tracks or my songs?
You're asking the wrong chap I know as much as you
So I'm just confusing matters but it has to be done
It's a factor in all the planet's mass populace
That we're asking for knowledge but lack what we want
There's certain facts that we won't actually know
We lack the composure to relax and just focus on absolute calm
And that can do harm so we have to succumb
To the fact that after we're gone we're transmitted back to the cosmos
And after the storm the pattern goes on
So you have to be strong, cos that's where you belong
But I want you to see what it's like to be me
And I want you to remember me
I want to be remembered when I enter into heaven
The day I die then greater than September the eleventh
But then again when in the history of men
Has there ever been an event that we never will forget
Eventually everything tends to irrelevance
'Til we're left with an ebb that can never be filled
Everything built inevitably will
Descend into a stillness until the end of the world
Seasons will change
Empires will fall
Don't panic, our planet's to vanish
You've had a few chances and now it is happening
Man, he has managed to damage the planet
So bad that it cannot be fixed
But the bigger the bomb, the quicker we're gone
So I quicken my rhythm and finish the song
I sit in the dark and picture a part
Of my heart but it's hard cos I ripped it apart
Split into half with all of our smarts
Sick of the starkness but I can't start
On a mission to start building an ark
Filled with the spark of a star that is dear to my heart
And here I depart




 This is not a subject many are approaching in rap
Among the showboating and boasts, I know I'm so full of crap
But I won't be complete without penning an ode to the fact
That I feel most at home stroking a cat
I feel his paws on my shoulder, so I turn and I'm poking him back
He kneads my knees and I know he's cozy, The chap's hoping to doze in my lap
It's fairly safe to say I'm open to that
Because I'm most at home stroking a cat

Jimmy
I'm stroking a cat
Sammy
See him doze in my lap
Patty
There's few feelings closer than that
I'm at home when I'm stroking a cat
Behind the ears, now under the chin
Tickle the tummy and feel the fluff on your skin

I had a cold heart but that frost was going to melt
Because your fine fluffy fur was the softest thing I've felt
Put me in contact with my lost and inner self
But gosh, your droppings are the most obnoxious thing I've smelt
If Jay Z had a baby
With a crazy cat lady
Their DNA would mutate to make me
It may be crazy
That I cradle cats in place of babies
But you wouldn't make me change my behaviour if you paid me
Maybe it's love, perhaps it's toxoplasmosis
Honestly, I'm kind of shocked that I wrote this
I'm too far gone, I'm lost and I'm hopeless
Put a poster on the lamp post for me and hope someone will notice

Jimmy
I'm stroking a cat
Sammy
See him doze in my lap
Patty
There's few feelings closer than that
I'm at home when I'm stroking a cat
Behind the ears, now under the chin
Tickle the tummy and feel the fluff on your skin

I try not to treat you anthropomorphically
But damn, if you could talk to me
That'd be awesome see
I need to reassure you
That I'll always be here for you
Though we are mere mortal beings, I would run a mile for every single minute that I fear for you
I'm no loyalist, but to me you are the real royal
Developed and bred up as a vicious predator
I found it tricky to picture, 'til you ripped that stick of feathers up
You're like a teddy bear, but sentient with agency
That's why I savour the sentiment you'd deign to play with me
The wide world is dangerous home's a haven, sweet
And if you need love enough I'm sure we have a vacancy

Jimmy
I'm stroking a cat
Sammy
See him doze in my lap
Patty
There's few feelings closer than that
I'm at home when I'm stroking a cat
Behind the ears, now under the chin
Tickle the tummy and feel the fluff on your skin

Aside from mewling, I'll never get to hear you speak
But we communicate in other ways enough to know you're unique
The pet sanctuary was a feline Who's Who
Perusing kittens like I was trying to get a new shoe
I wonder what the factor was that made me choose you
Don't know, perhaps you chose me and I just knew too
You had a true cuteness I never grew used to
It rips my heart apart knowing that soon I'll lose you

I don't want to lose you
I love you




 Roll up! Roll up!
Whatever your dysfunction
Conceal it from the public
With a super-injunction
If you plan to cover up
Your extra-marital seduction
Your Samaritans are "embarristers"
Who'll put up an obstruction

It costs 50 to a 100K
So if you've got enough to
Throw that kind of money away
You're A-OK
But for the rest of us
Who struggle to get as much
And as such must settle
For Tesco's own breakfast puffs
It's never enough
Plus it's evident, look;
Freedom of speech just took
A ferking terrible cut
But in the digital age
It is inevitable that
Just a simple Twitter page
Can make incredible ruptures
When someone's got the gumption
To publish your compunction
Then covering it up
Becomes tougher than tungsten
You and I can't do it
But the dude with the funds can
Its ferking fun to use a super-injunction

Roll up! Roll up!
Whatever your dysfunction
Conceal it from the public
With a super-injunction
If you need to receive
Sexual abuse from a truncheon
We got you covered, brother:
Just get a super-injunction

Did you know this song is illegal in the UK
Cos it reveals what you're unable to read in newspapers
Namely, that if you want to see the allegations
Visit this Twitter page to see what happened is shameless
Now laughing at famous people isn't particularly civil
But it's ridiculous that it can make me into a criminal
When disseminating facts and information
Can actually make you end up slapped in a cage
It's dangerous!
So fuck Carter-Ruck and Trafigura
They deserve an unlubricated cactus to the anus

Roll up! Roll up!
Whatever your dysfunction
Conceal it from the public
With a super-injunction
If you choose to get nude
And act rude in a dungeon
No sweat!
Just use your super-injunction

I feel like whistling, you know?
*Whistling*




 Sunbeams
Diffracted and fractured like young dreams
Lost chances to capture these sunbeams
Splintered and shattered like young dreams
That no longer matter

Among a thousand galaxies, each with a thousand stars
You're bound to find another like ours (ah)
Submerged and immersed in a version of earth
From innumerable years before your birth
Crash landed on an aquatic planet, stranded
Surrounded by oceanic expanses and no answers
A load of questions and no language to ask 'em in
But the fact is that I'm fascinated, so fasten in

Sunbeams
Dappled, divided like young dreams
Devoured, disunited on sunbeams
Disintegrated like young dreams
Embittered, dismayed
We descended under splentid rolling tides
You could find a hole and hide
Or you can rise, revolt and fight
Seize the day and you control the night

Deep down, down below the waves
Is a foreboding place from which you won't escape, no
On the sea floor of Aurora
We see flora and fauna
We feel awesome in auras
Of all different sorts, colours, warmths
And they're forming an ecosystem
Different pieces mixed into some biomes
Of symbiosis and I notice that
Such new sights can just bring eyes to focus
So slow down a moment and toke this hypnosis
No smoke in this ocean, we're floating
Unroped from the woes of the coast, no emotion but motion
Moving, soaking, soothing
If I can go there, so can you
Is it the moon in a mist or a lunar eclipse?
There's no mutual exclusion, the two can exist
(Aaah)

Nobody sees me in here
Yet the water's so clear
I guess that confirms what I had thought
Just me and Aurora in the spot
I feel isolation (isolation)
And fascination
I know it seems grim and I am lost
But I won't give in, ignore the cost
(I, oh, mmh)
So I keep gazing at

Sunbeams
Distorted, disjointed like young dreams
Crushed, disappointed, these sunbeams
Fractured, fragmented like young dreams
Left unattended
We descended under splentid rolling tides
You could find a hole and hide
Or you can rise, revolt and fight
Seize the day and you control the night

And you control the night
And you control the night
You control the night
Ooh




 Ahem
Let me spin  you a little yarn
Weave a tale or two
If you know what I mean

I cut you no slack, this is a bossa nova throwback
Brought to you in association with paramount sew-vac
The local business where snitches can go to get their stitches
Without the need for extortionate medical assistance

Re-read the text, I'll hide a load of sewing puns
While other rappers are just millin' about, showing guns
If you're having sewing problems, I feel bad for you, son
I've got 99 problems, but a stitch ain't... one
P-p-paramount
Sewing
P-paramount
P-p-p-paramount
Sewing
P-paramount

You ain't probably never heard of me
I like to do embroidery
It's a whole other side of me
You've cottoned onto finally
It's not my fault, the bottom line is
That I'm dressed to jest, it's prolly best
You swap your polyester vest for the warp and weft
Of a razzle dazzle fab upholstery
Tweed suits like Basil Fawlty
It seems you need to work on your self esteem
You're acting salty
Grab a haberdashery, then add a dash of me
That's a fantastic patterned lavish fabric tapestry
Imagine Al Pacino in alpaca chinos
Strollin' out of the casino
Down to paramount cause he knows
His clothes need loads of work
To stay lookin' superior
Who woulda thought that such a notion would be real
But here we are!

Whether made of tweed, fleece, linen, crepe, brocade or knitted
Whatever way I spin these lyrics
I guarantee that they are tailor fitted
To the beat, even if you think I skipped it
I bring that thread back through the needle
On the groove sits in
I'm in the pocket, you're bobbin' your head
Til I ruffle your feathers
And pull you together, like cotton and thread
Like a dressmaker
My fingers are deft, nimble
No frills, it's dead simple
I am a thex thimble
The oddest spitter, lyrical bodice ripper
Not cause I'm hot, but cause I can't undo the bloody zipper
Do me a favor, would you, buddy?
Run and get the scissors
But don't run back with them
Or you'll be cut to bloody ribbons

 Some of the happiest days are when the sun rays cascade
Over your back in the most naturally placid of ways
You don't have to ask whether perhaps it'll rain
And the centigrade never strays past twenty eight
It's fantastically great kicking back with your mates
And knowing no, you don't have to act to your age
You can snack on a Flake or take a basket of cakes
But make sure you've got some factor eight splashed on your face
And the ladies make daisies attached in a chain
While the lads entertain them with a basketball game
And then after we're knackered and the match has been played
Grab a glass of lemonade and relax in the shade
We'll bask and just laze in the grass's green blades
And sit back and just gaze at the paths of the planes
Nothing matters today, you can chatter and play
Playful antics under blankets of immaculate haze
Once upon a summer
The sun plays across the lawn
Once upon a summer
The air is sweet and warm
Once upon a summer
Heavenly and calm
Once upon a summer
It's never been this fun
It's ace when you're tipsy and playing with a frisbee
There ain't been better days in the pages of history
And though your hay fever itches and makes you be sniffly
It's blatantly plain that you'll savour and miss these
Great times when they're gone, days lying in the sun
Bathing, misbehaving and playfighting for fun
They might have been some of the days of your life that you'll always
Be reminded of when your time to pass away finally comes
And as the day becomes night and the sun goes down
The shadows grow slow and cloak round your home town
There's no sound but the bees and the birds
And slowly but certainly the season returns
You turn down to the ground and there's leaves on the earth
Turning brown and allowing the trees to rebirth
There's a breeze in the air and it breathes through your hair
And that's it - summer leaves for the year
Summer's come and gone
The day's no longer young
Summer's come and gone
But the memory lives on




 Open your little door
Step out into the downpour
Listen to the sound your
Listen to the sound your soul makes
As if it's soulmates
With the ground
The rain falls down
The ground
The rain falls down
To the floor

The summer rain has come again
The pavement sizzles like drizzling lemonade
Oh, and the sunlight seems unlikely
To be on my cheeks for one fine evening

There's nobody else around
Absence has a powerful sound
Blades of grass are fine enough to make a scalpel proud
Alka-seltzer sizzle drizzle pelts the ground
I can't help myself but shout aloud
To tell the crowd
That while they're out, I'm out of bounds
I could flee til my knees hurt
Feel the breeze in my t-shirt
But there's so many aesthetically pleasing things here to see first


Flowers bob, nod and rattle
Under fat drops of rain as big as apples
And the street steams like a kettle, singing
Each bead a little a nettle, stinging
My skin in a million different places
Precipitation amidst the vegetation
The British air is changing
And sitting under parked cars there are kitties waiting
Watching me pace by
I stop and then say hi


Could never sing, but I sang though; Dionysius
Air rang with the tang of a mango; delicious
Living in a fictitious middle English mangrove, that's been kissed
With the liquid sunshine that some find in Orlando
I hang under the jungle canopy
Catching an undiluted glimpse of clarity
Refracting through the prism imprisoning my sanity
For all the laws we're living in anarchy
Causing wars, it's giving me anomy
The rows of windows are frames inside a strange gallery
Of apathy
Inhabitants happily having tea
Warm water colours reality
Washes away the banality


My hair is getting wetter
The air is getting fresher
Before the storm I'm sure I could barely bear the pressure out
But it's getting better now
It was one of those horribly hot days
The barometer's ominous clock face
Was something Hieronymus Bosch paints
From Shropshire to Gloucester to Warwickshire
Forests of conifers congregate like choristers
And praise displays of flowers as a florist does
Knowledge buds and blooms in the soil
Olives crushed producing an oil
To lubricate the mind
Illuminate and shine
A human ray of light
Right through the rain tonight
It just might quite save a life




 Oh
Oh
Oh the londeners come to see the Unterzee
They flock to the docks and watch the boxes and stocks
That are dropped from atop of the steamers and frigates
And dreadnoughts and cutters
And cruisers and corvettes and yachts
Each and every of them a story has got
Here's ours:

'Twas dark when we parted the port
And started our voyage to far, distant shores
This tiny tub's not the fastest for sure
But I'd rather have her than no transport at all
From humble beginnings
I come for your winnings
There's always a calm before there's a storm
So batten the hatchers
And pull down your patches
We're passing through gaider's mourn
'til we find the dawn
Smell the sea breeze
A cold chill
Neptune's deep freeze
Now i'm not sure of the maritime law down here
So we'll do as we please

We sail the sea x2
The sunless sea x2
We sail the sea
We plunder deep
And run from creatures
From beneath the sunless sea
The sunless sea
We sail the sea
The sunless sea
We sail the sea
We plunder deep
And run from creatures
From beneath the sunless sea

Tides are lapping on the side
Rising damp
Eyes widen with fright
Light the lamp
No mind how cramped
We will ride
'Till we find any island in sight
Now camp
Is that a lighthouse lamp
Or a giant crab?
Is it a shark
Or can we disembark?
Oh
Rats
Better sink the barge
Although im not a whale
I am deffo living large
You're a land lubber
I was born in sand
Blubbers in my blood
But  look damn good when i scrub up
Any port in a storm tear the pub up
Three months out at sea
Means there's going to be some hubbub


When we've each had our fill of the menu
We head out the venue
Prepared to continue
Turning that lard into muscle and sinew
Discover just how much swashbuckle is in you
When you're smuggling human souls
Whose tombs are cold
You lose control
You're ravenous too
The food is mouldy
Too damn salty
The deep hue of this blue's unholy
Fool, I told you
Skippers who comsume their crews are lonely
And fuel is low
We've used the coal
So I'm cruising home




 Dan Bull: Oi, Shizzy!
Shizzy: Yeah?
Dan Bull: Rap battle? Super Smash Brothers?
Shizzy: Red
Dan Bull: Sorted

Look, you've been invited to the battlefield of war
With a cast of characters I'm sure you have all seen before
I'm the Master Hand from smacking you, I'm snatching up your score
Ganon to the Dorf, slamming to the floor, kats I'm packing up for sure
Trophy on my shelf after Yoshi loses his health
Eating like Wario, I gradually loosen my belt
Cuz I get a tad gassy after having devoured
Competitors for an hour, more boss than Bowser

I'm a bad mother, the master of Super Smash Brothers
True fact, don't believe me? Then you can ask others
Got fond memories of smashing them like past lovers
So amass your gang together for the Last Supper
I'll hack and slash them like a beam sword through a pack of butter
I'm heavyweight rolling through like a fat trucker
Slap daft buggers from behind like a back scrubber
Give you a palette swap, to blue and black colours

Back brother
Venues get ripped for days
Powerful, like Skull Kid, I'll flip the stage
It won't take a Final Smash from me to bring you D-Day
I'll just wind up and punch your lights out like DK
(What did he say?) You never heard someone mad before?
Murdering anyone ever to make it, like the Master Core?
If you're taking a minute to battle it's easy
Break the controller, blast your TV
That'll be way better off for your health
It'll be worse if you ever did see me

Smash! Smash!
Brother, smash! Smash!
You better dash! Dash!
Brother, dash! Dash!
Or you'll get smashed! Smash!
Brother, smash! Smash!
You better dash! Dash!
Brother, dash! Dash!
Or you'll get smashed!

Do you want to demolish this jaunty song?
Take me on one v one, I'll prove you promptly wrong
You're an iddy biddy little Diddy, I'm a Donkey Kong
I'm a Fazioli grand piano, you're a Honky Tonk
Is it bad form to smack you off the platform
So hard your head cracks open like a Smash Ball?
My home run bat will smack you through the back door
So hard you'll be like: "Ow, what you do that for?"

Spitting that fire and bringing you hell
Chillin' in first? I got a Blue Shell
Go tell ya momma and go tell ya gramma
If they play too, I'm swinging a hammer
I'm taking no damage I'm holding the star
And I'm more of a star than a Luma with bars
A legend in fact you can ask about him
I'll burn you like punches from Captain Falcon

I'll cook and sauté you 'til we need some more players
What's fun is four players, as fun as foreplay is
I ain't got beef with you, you little Pikachu
But come and see me on the stage if you're eager to
You'll see the truth, the reason for my fame
When I finish you, what can I say but "Game."

Smash! Smash!
Brother, smash! Smash!
You better dash! Dash!
Brother, dash! Dash!
Or you'll get smashed! Smash!
Brother, smash! Smash!
You better dash! Dash!
Brother, dash! Dash!
Or you'll get smashed!

 Hi, I’m Nigel Burke
You might know me as the guy that lurks
In the hospital pulling back the final curtains
As saving lives is my line of work
I’m overworked, and I’m overpaid
Nobody else gets home as late
No time to poo, no time to wee
To go on a date, no time to sleep, see
But regardless, of what they’re paying me
I’m the hardest, in the A & E
A couple of whiskies, a couple of baileys
I’m ready for my shift; give me the blade, please
This is an emergency surgery, third degree burns
Leave the patient waiting in purgatory, operating with urgency
We can’t take an eternity, blood loss rate is discernibly
Worse than the state of my purse on my Lace Anniversary
Unlucky
That’s why I stay here so late just to earn a fee
That’s why the patient is late, toe-tagged and lay on a slate
In this infirmary
Yeah, I may have made a mistake
There may be stains on my apron
But baby, hey, I’m just saying
That when the table is shaking
In the back of an ambulance
It’s a little difficult to keep on track what your hands are doing
Oh golly, when you’re on a trolley
Trying to find the right tool’s like Where’s Wally
If I was you I’d be crying for my mommy
I’d give you a tissue, but I’ve not got one on me
Sorry, I’m a little unprepared
But luckily you’re not in a position to be running scared
Caught you unawares, anaesthetised
Now you’re asleep, give me your teeth and eyes
What are you worried about? Who’s scary?
I’m just the new tooth fairy
I’m coming for your calcium
Like a loon let loose in the dairy
When I said I’m not a dentist what I meant is
Of all my skills, it’s just a percentage
My qualifications might be invented
But I won’t get better without trying to attempt it
Dentally demented, I tend to need apprentices
Because it’s them that seem to comprehend more than me
I generally pretend it, and so far I’ve never been suspended
In theatre, I’m territorial
Less surgical, more gladiatorial
If this gets any more gory
I’ll put it on YouTube as a tutorial
I’ve been awake on call for days
My eyes are red as when I went to Ultralase
Not a qualified eye surgeon
But I can’t help but help when you’re eye’s hurting
See, I’m a nice person, Chris Martin
I’ll try to fix you; quick, stick a heart in!
Enough blarting, we’ve hit an artery
Made a chest cavity big enough to park in
Demographically setting a precedent
Increasing the speed that you’ll get an inheritance
I never get done for medical negligence
Not because I’m good, but ‘cause I bury the evidence
Demographically setting a precedent
Increasing the speed that you’ll get an inheritance
I never get done for medical negligence
Not because I’m good, but ‘cause I bury the evidence

Chop chop!
You’re life in my hands




 This is a letter to Bethesda
In which I beg you to stick together
For the new elder scrolls and you flipping better
Other wise I'm going to pester you forever
Except when I'm playing fallout new vegas this November
But please we need another elder scrolls
If I don't get another one I'll go out of control
Sure fallout was a hole different level and it was incredible
But it didn't have the visual elegance and mistic mythic elements
That lifted it through excellence and into sheer perfectionism
Transcendence isn't something I'd expect sitting next to computers
But what you presented to us is beauteous
Playing oblivion made me oblivious to my surroundings
How could a game be this intricate
But after a thousand hours of play
I'm inthralled with it all now to this day
I've found an escape from the imperial prison of everyday living
So take me to oblivion again
Take me to oblivion again
Take me to oblivion
Thanks dan I couldn't have put it better
Get it together Bethesda or we'll keep penning you letters
Being a vault dweller was special but wet was forgettable
So I'll never settle for anything less than an elder scrolls
Consumed by blood moon swallowed by morrowind
When I step into oblivion I'm instantly lost in it
Escape the modern concrete office monotony
But not only when I pop the DVD rom in the slot and unlock my dreams
Grab my magic hat daggers and a wabbajack
Pack them in the saddle bag and travel through these savage lands
Is quite depressing how obsessed I was getting
With checking out every chest to collect every set of weapons
I sand on the planets edge and gaze at the Hazy sea
It's crazy how ones and zeros behave so amazingly
Take me from these rainy streets
Please take me to oblivion again
Please Take me to oblivion again
Please Take me to oblivion




 (Why the teardrops keep on falling from my eyes)

Look
I can't walk the streets at night
Without seeing violence, people fighting
Drunk girls on their knees and crying
No wonder young people feel a need to buy drink
But it's not to do with alcohol
It's about losing self control
You'd sell your soul to get out this hole
So you keep digging down like hell's your goal
Your troubles double a thousand fold
It's happening in countless households now, it's cold
You got a new phone, replaced the old model
But you ain't got a role model
And you won't find one at the bottom of a bottle
But what I want to know is
How can England get better in health
Without an inch of respect for herself?
It brings tears to my eyes...
(Why the teardrops keep on falling from my eyes)




 THE ALDMERI DOMINION (ESO Chapter 3)

We are the Khajit, the elite sneak thief
Concealing the secrets that we each keep
With the leanest of feet and the meanest of teeth
We can clean out your keeps in just three minutes each
So that means if you need something stealing
Then really you need to just leave it to me : the Khajit
Look it up, Skooma's the new drug and cooking it up
We produce it with moon sugar, it'll soon soothe your troubles
As you just succumb to the tune of the drums and the lutes
As they hum and they hoot and they strum and they shoot
With the stars, under the blue of the moons
As we run on the rooves through ruins and roots
We are ruling the roost robbing rubies and runes
You will rue being rude when you reach our lair
And you'll kneel at the throne of the prince of Elsweyr

Our opinion's the dominion is a kingdom that'll bring Nirn
To ascendance with a vengeance, not dependent on a thing, no

We're wood elves, what else ?
Wood houses are where we delve and we dwell in the dells
Some seldom would doubt if you touch our trees
You'll be held to account
Down for the count down under the canopy
What now for you ? Well, you're becoming a canapé
See, we eat each other, we're cannibalistic
And it's a compliment if you should call us animalistic
We're symbiotic with the living things we live with
Resist affliction, Vigor, lead the leaves and lift spirits
These forests will remain forever Bosmer
Real archers in the woods, never mention Kevin Costner
I tote a bow that no-one else could aim as good
So don't claim you could
Or I'll make acquainted, feather, brain and wood
Made of Aldmeri blood, the place we hail from, Valenwood
We came and took our native place and greatly raised it up


Yeah, be quiet now, we're the high elves
We're tall enough to take things off really high shelves
We do the bidding of the scrolls of praxis
You'll find us casting magic over holding axes
Exalted and thin with golden tanned skin
Behold the aristocratic and magnaminous grand kin
Descended from the deities so say your prayers please
We've agents every place, increase the range Ayren sees
Clearly superior in whatever area we dare to appear in
There ain't a better Mer here, the more the merrier
So where are your men when you need them ?
They see us and flee, fled in terror
You'll wish you wielded just some of that style
When we use the common tongue to summon that bile
If you come and get vile in the summerset isle
Then I'ma set fire to your bum and get wild




 The Gods...
The Gods are dead

The whole world as we've come to know it is broken
Since the sun's eye blinked shut and never opened
The lakes, plains and the oceans are frozen
The Gods are dead
Yet someone over us has spoken, saying
Fill up the flagons
Pack the wagons
And advance the Caravan
Through arid lands
Narrow valleys
Parry avalanches
Trudging through the snow
Clutching to the hope
That we'll be crunching dredge to slush
As we deliver crushing blows

The drum beat threads pointed needles
With the noise of a big hammer
The saga of our paths entwined
Embroidered in the Banner
So wave your Banners high
Make them fan the sky
Though you're just as much a mortal man as I
We do not plan to die

I am Rook
I do things by the book
Since childhood I toed the line that Iver took
I've seen vile things;
Grunts, rapping gruff rhymes
Skalflings
Varl Kings
From the Gruin Sea to Groffheim
Meet me at the Mead House at three bells
I need a Siege Archer and a Shieldbanger
See my renown
Can you hear the thunder?
By the Beard of Dundr
Gods know the Godstone's got me crying tears of wonder

Night is here, and thus we must find a bed to slumber
I am but a Hunter
Liable for providing
For fighting fit men numbering a hundred
Fighting fits of hunger
I must guide lumbering Varl
Or risk lying ripped asunder

The drum beat threads pointed needles
With the noise of a big hammer
The saga of our paths entwined
Embroidered in the Banner
So wave your Banners high
Make them fan the sky
Though you're just as much a mortal man as I
We do not plan to die

On the first day the Earth quakes
Your nerves shake
But your fate is certain
No need to let your reserve break
You must assert;
Bravery and an alert brain
Will serve to save you from a world of hurt
And will avert pain
Marching ever forward
No rest, lest we be cornered
Tortured then slaughtered
Hung, drawn and quartered
Bellower will see the error of his ways ever so soon
When we thread his dread and terror's weft
Back into Mother's loom

The drum beat threads pointed needles
With the noise of a big hammer
The saga of our paths entwined
Embroidered in the Banner
So wave your Banners high
Make them fan the sky
Though you're just as much a mortal man as I
We do not plan to die
Wave your banners high
Make them fan the sky
Though you're just as much a mortal man as I
We do not plan to die




 Excuse me, outlander
A word in your ear, if I may

Well met, stranger
Elated to make your acquaintance
Now, may I entertain you with some quotations over cadence?
You see, I bear some rare, amazing information
And you look like someone who is used to strange situations
There is a hidden portal within the Bard's College
I was brought through, an immortal to impart knowledge
About an other-wordly form of Redguard sonnet
They took a thumping drum beat and said bars on it
I wandered through Solitude, departed Haafingar
Past Hjaalmarch, through The Reach, east of Markarth
I reached the Whiterun Hold
I preached in rhyme and told the people
That the need to speak was higher than the price of gold
Nothing can beat soul, not even sweet rolls
I've got it locked like a pick stuck in a keyhole
I leave you wee trolls wishing that you'd re-rolled
By the Nine Divines, my rhyme's a sight to behold
My freeholds are threefold
I rock the property chain
Cause I'm the top bloody Thane in this Monopoly game
So you'd better watch the throne, Stormcloak
Cause you're getting overthrown by an ordinary bloke
It's high time Skyrim had a new High King
And I like hiking - it's quite exciting
I'm descended from the Vikings back in my kingdom
But my lyric writing's better than my skill at fighting
My pen is mightier than swords; it's the right choice
They call me "MF Thu'um" when I use my Voice
With each rap, my Speechcraft keeps stacking
If you could see the graph, you'd actually be laughing
You'll never sound as fresh, I'm a rockstar
I climb the seven thousand steps to High Hrothgar
Like Jurgen Windcaller, my words'll bring more disorder
Than mixing Skooma in an Orcish brigand's drink order
A bawdy bard that raps, my Voice'll cause your cart to crash
Your horse's armor cracks under the awesome force of Paarthurnax
But here's the secret I needed to tell:
You can be an MC with me aswell
Forget the Blades, me and you don't need the Greybeards
Who are Mehrunes Dagon and the Daedra to an atheist?
Mages, take your Spell Tome and go the hell home
Cause who needs boots of speed when we've got shell toes?
And, so whether you drink Honeymead or Alto
Be sure that Dan'll smelt flows 'til all of Tamriel knows
You should use the bars of the bard deep inside you
And 'til we meet again, friend: Talos guide you
Talos guide you




 Oi, my name, is Daniel Recker
Join my game, and Dan'll wreck ya
Do me a nice favour
Get out of my face or
I might take a whole skyscraper
And even more later maybe three to four acres
Plus every map from Paracel Storm, Resort to Dawnbreaker
Sneak into my Flood Zone, you're cover's soon blown
I'll turn your dog tag into a little tombstone
Is this a revolutionary game or just a new clone?
Who knows?
Judging by the sales figures, you don't
Man, I could stand here and shoot for hours
'Till I've taken out everyone of the three global superpowers
A vision of the future, 2020
My vision's super duper, 20/20
I'm equiped with many shooters, plenty, plenty
Big Bang, Sheldon Cooper, Penny, Penny

Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
Is it Battlefield 3?
No, it's Battlefield 4
(x2)

You know Dan's mission is make a Rogue Transmission
Set the dial on your radio and listen
What happens when you open a platinum battlepack?
You get a single track CD, this battle rap
You're the PC, to my Apple Mac
Fundamentally opposed, so get out my habitat
I'll blast mags, even more than Jackfrags
Point at all the things with the same finger with which I snatch tags
It doesen't matter what I see these fools toting
I just double it up, dual scoping
One for each of your prepubecent balls, grow some
School's open, and I leave every rule broken

Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
Is it Battlefield 3?
No, it's Battlefield 4
(x2)

I've got a bull's head, I think I'm a minotaur
I shot you fools dead, extinct, like a dinosaur
Look at you crying now, what you whining for?
You can either leave through the window or by the door
There's a pile of corpses by your fortress
Who left that there?
Well, I'd have thought it was me
'Cos I'm the type to counter-knife y'all
Wipe the blood off my brow and say "wow, how delightful"
A knife in a gunfight, this is how it's done, right?
If I didn't give you a chance, it'd be unpolite
There's panic in the streets, Humberside
You are not safe here, Honey Pie
Ask Bonnie Tyler what I did to her heart
I more than eclipsed it, I ripped it apart
I'd rather play Battlefield than with her tits and her arse
Regarding military ditties, I turned it to an art
Listen

Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
Is it Battlefield 3?
No, it's Battlefield 4
(x2)

Hip-hop-ha, clippity-clap
This is the Battlefield Rap, yay!
(2x)




 I'm Geralt of Rivia
Could I be pithier
While ripping through the fibulas and tibias of idiots?
There isn't a living thing I couldn't kill at all
Kill them all with a silver sword
No wonder Vizima built that wall
Whether Golem, Vodnick, Godling, Foglet, Doppler, Cockatrice, Dog, or Botchling
Warg or Chort or Forktail
You all fail
Ghouls and wolves
I pull a Werewolf by his tail
Drown the Devil by the Well
Burn the Dragon of Fyresdal
Wild white wolves and Wyverns fight Cyclops and Sirens
Nightwraiths, Hybrids and Hyms and Ice Giants
Seems these beasts are very keen to be seen in the bestiary
Venomous, more than a bee sting
Know what I mean Emreis?

Half swordplay
Slay my way through the bestiary
Half wordplay
Phrases painting your obituary
Half swordplay
Slay my way through the bestiary
Half wordplay
Phrases painting your obituary
For monsters I use a steel will and silver sword, done
And for man I use a steel sword and a silver tongue

I'm built hard to deal with Nilfgaard
I'm real scarred
And I will kill even when I spar with guards
But it's the children of the wilderness I'm skilled with killing
When I'm not chilling
Getting my fill of different women
Well, I have it out with Alghouls and Howlers
Gargoyles and Drowners
Nithral, Trolls, Hounds, D'ao, Salma, Devourers
Lamias, Harpies, Sarastis and Rotfiends and Ogres and Crones
Hurting Kernun, Beserkers, Shriekers, Beasts and Ghosts
Nekker, Necrophage, Specter, Pesta, Pest or Penitent
Relict, Imp, Bear or Djinn, Therazane or Eredin
Elementa, Leshen, Endregas and Ekimmaras
While I meditate and wait, you'll never see tomorrow
Plague Maidens and Wraiths, Graveirs, and Grave Hags
Cave Trolls, White Ladies and Wham-A-Whams
Water Hag, Morvuud, Tangleores and Ekhidnas
Pull apart Mourntarts, Shriekers, Fiends and Mucknixers
Imlerith, Ifrits, Spirits, and Speartips and Griffins
From Katakan to Basilisk and frickin' itchy Midges
Imagine Guybrush Threepwood meets Clint Eastwood
I wish a beast would
It'd be ploughing reet good

Half swordplay
Slay my way through the bestiary
Half wordplay

 Brotherhood
Brotherhood
Brotherhood
Brotherhood

Dash back to the Renaissance
Like a racehorse
Mate I'll slash your face off
Make sure that I'll break your jaw
Like I break laws
Grateful that I gained the support of a new patron
Stationed in the papal states
But I take short breaks on days off
To take tours round Spain lakes or Naples
What, you wanna fight me?
Why didn't you say so?
What are you thinking that I'm bringing these blades for
Flush with the weaponry
Yep I've got a lot
Atop of your neck is a terracotta pot
You wanna watch, it's not going to topple off
Whoop, butterfingers
What a clot
Death comes sweet like I'm serving butterscotch
Let's turn this up a notch

The brotherhood
Is our home
But it's understood
That when in Rome
We do as the Romans do
Appropriate their culture
And then use it to ruin you
(Use it to ruin you, ruin you)

Half animal, half cannonball
Fired out of the prow of a man of war
Without the sound of gunpowder pounding
Prowling around veiled in the crowd around me
I smell a heap of trouble
So I'm clambering the rubble
Then I'm running from an alley to a tunnel
Like I'm Sally Gunnell
My genes are a museum
Look within, see what I'm seeing
From columns to Colosseum
I'm one of these hitmen
Whose victim isn't gonna see 'em
As a policy I'm surreptitious
Polish anyone off becoming suspicious
Sophisticated enough to know
When I need to be thoroughly vicious
If I was you
I'd strap on a parachute
You never know who's dropping in
From out the blue
Have you heard the way
The biggest birds of prey
Can take a baby away like an invertebrate?
With a steel spine
I've the nerve to say
That I'm a spider
Now finish up your curds and whey

The brotherhood
Is our home
But it's understood
That when in Rome
We do as the Romans do
Appropriate their culture
And then use it to ruin you
The brotherhood
Is our home
But it's understood
That when in Rome
We do as the Romans do
Appropriate their culture
And then use it to ruin you

(Use it to ruin you)




 You're a dead man walking
Going hard on the brakes
It's like you're Dead Man Walkn
Going hard on the breaks
I'm going to LA
To roll over you, ese
Then I've got to get to New York today
Roll over USA
Set the car onto cruise control
And roll on the roads that my crews control
Nothing hits harder than damn bull bars
I mean, nothing hits harder than Dan Bull bars
Race in a race with me?
You'll blow your tyre out
Go face to face with me?
You blow, you'll tire out
Car to car, I'll always have more torque in a bout
Disagree or think differently?
What you talking about?
I'm street racing in your borough
Underground
Chasing you bunnies back to your burrow
Underground
I killed and left your pet Kookaburra
On the ground
Then bring a spade to its grave, bruh
And dig 'round
My favourite place to import coffee from
And the type of instant coffee that I like?
Burundi...
...Ground

This is the chorus of the song
THE CREW
(x4)

When I'm in my car I'm going hard with it
You be soft
You're in the pits when I wave the black flag
Ubisoft
They could try and stop us in a copse and rob us
Modern Highwaymen
It's real life cops and robbers
You tried to build a little scene
And got no-one to show for it
I jacked a limousine
Now there's no-one to chauffeur it
I'll tailgate your Mercedes-Benz
Until you hit a tree and see how your Mercedes bends
I don't just flip a policeman
I flip the police, man
When you hear a siren you're like:
"Flip, the police, man!"
My fans are like my wheels
With the screeches I elicit
Hey listen, your track record just isn't as ill, is it?
Illicit street courier
Good at getting gear
Look at you struggle with the clutch
You couldn't get in gear
I'm an important geez, importing keys
I'm feared by the stevedores in ports and quays
If my car reaches a river then I'll take it to the bridge
Where I'll, make like James Brown and take it to the bridge


I'm a lyrical and homonymical brain
That's why I made every line the same




 It’s the dawn of the Second Era, war is getting nearer
Former enemies get together form a better, clearer
Bigger force of Bretons, Orcs and Redguards
To fill hearts with dread and leave seas of heads scarred
The Bretons are the Westerners that trek the depth and breadth
Of Tamriel through Hammerfell ‘til we have dealt with every pestilence
In essence, Bretons are the sages of the lessons in the pages
Of the Ancient Books, the weapons of the mages
Respected through the ages as professional and gracious
Due to dressing in the raiments of the excellentest tailors
The Gift of Magnus give us bags of extra Magicka
So many spells you’d have a hella job to add it up
We swear fealty to High King Emeric
And anybody that doesn’t is going to get a haemorrhage
So pour a beverage, and hold it up high
Promise to serve the Covenant even if we must die
No other government is running us; we’re warriors
They cannot worry us; we do not know what worry is
From the humblest man to the baddest Lord
Raise our hands up with the flags and let the dagger fall

Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
Deep, and true, and you can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
True, and deep, and we can have it all

We are the Orsimer, nobody’s awesomer
War’s in our blood, while yours never poured thinner
Spilling warm innards on the floor in a small inn
And eat poor little paupers up, for dinner
Pick up the porter and pour in some more liquor
Raw ichor, getting slaughtered’ll leave you
All with a little bit more than a sore liver
You’ve no more hope than a small glimmer
Your Lord’s never ever going to forgive us
Whether Lawgivers or sinners
We are warring for a cause and we fought it with the force
Of a horse with the balls of a pure winner
Blacksmiths, axes, add it to the axis
Of actual madness you’re going to get whacked with
From the humblest man to the Dragonborn
Raise our hands up with the flags and let the dagger fall

Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
Deep, and true, and you can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
True, and deep, and we can have it all

See the dagger fall after the hammer fell
Plan a parry and it is apparent that your plan’ll fail
From Sentinel, our power’s spanning all of Tamriel
In every race’s annals, tales of our battles sail
Over moats and castles; vales, overdose on powerful ale
For we shall regale you with how we’re tough as dragonscale
Then hit you right on the head like a hammered nail
Breathtaking so don’t forget you can inhale
Stacked physiques, we’re athletes in wrapped sheets
From a land of vast heat, our rap sheets
Are longer than an Abecean Anvil back street
Fact: we eat bread and the crust, and thus we be incredibly buff
But it’s never enough, we never let muscles or metal descend into rust
So anyone coming and messing with us is getting rebuffed, offended and cussed
Then we have push with the adrenaline rush
We leave our enemies crushed with every thrust
So you’d better be hushed lest you end up as dust
Forward for Daggerfall!

Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
Deep, and true, and you can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
True, and deep, and we can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
Deep, and true, and you can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
True, and deep, and we can have it all




 You're a-
Bout to see NerdCubed and Emma Blackery
Sat on their settee
Having a chat and acting naturally
About the things that casually
Imagining or randomly
All the wacky things that happen
On the planet actually
Spaced out like you're lacking gravity
Or watching that TV
First thing early on a Saturday
Bad for your anatomy
Addictive as tobacco leaf
Comparably as powerful as
The power plant in Battersea
Whatever your locality
You're welcome join the family
But be warned
There could be casual profanity
Wee all aboard before
The masses reach capacity
Internationally renowned
No need for nationality
We haven't string attached
To our hospitality
We plan to leave you happily
Ever after that's the strategy
You'd have to be
Daft to leave
And that'd be a tragedy
It's Demma
And that stands for Dan and Emma Blackery




 It takes five days for society to break
Starvation, hunger, violence and rape
The United States of America's dead of her epidemic yet again
The violin should play
When you orchestrate and prepare an awful state of affairs is it fair
To say that you paid to rob your own grave?
With nature defaced, the decay is ingrained
You can't take the truth 'til its straight in your face
And it's too late to change it or take it away
Fate is a strange thing, we predicted the happenings
Straight after late capitalism
But we didn't prepare
For the winter despair
There was frost on the glass
We were lacking the vision
But for what little is left we need a tactical mission
And for that, we can thank The Division

New York City
Could it be more gritty?
Money is the root of all evil
So when we fall farther it seems more fitting
New York City
Could it be more gritty?
Money is the root of all evil
Would our dear forefathers weep or pity?

Rewind
Flash back for a minute as we shoot back five days
To Black Friday
New York, feel the boom bap vibrate
Street map is a true rat like maze
Open jail, flip the gulag sideways
Too late to glue cracks, view that crime rate
Whole city's in a 2Pac mindstate
Thugging at eachother to get food and hydrate
Better get moving to that highway
Come on, if you really wanna do that, why wait?
Pack your bags, grab your shoes and migrate
Cause a dead president's a dude that's irate
For a land built on dirty money
It's absurdly funny
That it's turning ugly
But you know humans, we just keep running
And we will, it is our will, and this is a free country

New York City
Could it be more gritty?
Money is the root of all evil
So when we fall farther it seems more fitting
New York City
Could it be more gritty?
Money is the root of all evil
Would our dear forefathers weep or pity?

The president says to do whatever it takes
To tether the threads and weather the state
Defend it against any tremors and quakes
Hell or heaven could make
My vector can spray
Like a rector can pray
So I'll rectify lies, correct your mistakes
You're treading a fine line with steps that you take
So you might find my bootprint etched in your face
Yes siree, we do what's necessary
Every discretionary decision is left up to me
Definitely
Stepping the street
With weapon ready
To step in and cease
The spread of the epidemic dead on its feet
Second guessing whoever we meet
We're a second from our severed head and spines lying separately
So I'm speaking to my team with techy telepathy
If I protect them
They protect me

New York City
Could it be more gritty?
Money is the root of all evil
So when we fall farther it seems more fitting
New York City
Could it be more gritty?
Money is the root of all evil
Would our dear forefathers weep or pity?




 From Black Marsh, we are Argonians
Other breeds act harsh, treat us as lowly ‘uns
We’ve been cursed, trodden into the dirt
So we developed a thick skin, there’s little can hurt us
And when it does, we’re the best at Restoration
Quick to mend, assist a friend to get to destinations
Never raise voices, forever stay moist
In the everglade place, we settled and made choices
Never been considered as a master race
But then we’re quick to switch and adapt to change
It isn’t an idiom when we say we’re amphibian
Fill a ditch with a bit of liquid and we live in them
There’s no bigger mystery than our history
Shrouded under visions in the shadow of the Hist tree
We’re pale, vicious, what ails you, we resist
Witness our tails flick as we hail Sithis

So never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact
Or you’ll never ever, ever get your severed arm back
Whether you are governed by your head or heart that
Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact
I said never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact
Or you’ll never ever, ever get your severed arm back
Whether you are governed by your head or heart that
Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact

We are the Dark Elves, tackle every task well
Nobody can casts spells quite as well as ourselves
Breaking through your hard shells, taking you to half health
The greatest of the fables and the tales that the bard tells
We’re in pursuit of a higher truth
And we’ll chase it through flames, that’s why they made us fireproof
Some say we’re quite aloof but our race just might produce
The one to execute the Daedra and tie the noose
Nothing’ll touch you just as tragic as Destruction magic
Ramp it up to maximum then cast to make you rushed and panicked
Crushed and damaged, this isn’t just an anecdote
Our mana flows up so savage
We’ll leave your head pounding, leaking like a fountain
Blood coming down like lava from the Red Mountain
To underestimate the Dunmer’s a direct mistake
You’ll be torn asunder, plundered and then left to fate

So never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact
Or you’ll never ever, ever get your severed arm back
Whether you are governed by your head or heart that
Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact
I said never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact
Or you’ll never ever, ever get your severed arm back
Whether you are governed by your head or heart that
Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact

We are the Nords, we’re bringing hordes
Banging on the big drums to ringing chords
Singing war choruses, swinging swords
Killing all sorts of Orcs and winning wars
In the beginning was a civil war in the north
Land of Atmora, the warlord Ysgramor
Brought us to the shores of an old cold continent
Confident we’d conquer it, we conquered it with confidence
Skyrim was ours now, as it shall ever be
For we are the fiercest warriors you’ll ever see
With our two-handed weapon expertise
We’re rugged and robust, you look featherweight next to these
Combat’s a long-lasting state of ecstasy
Bring any weapon that you want, you’ll never get the best of me
No-one but the Eight Divines could ever set my destiny
Many men have tried it, now many rest in peace

So never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact
Or you’ll never ever, ever get your severed arm back
Whether you are governed by your head or heart that
Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact
I said never start spats with the Ebonheart Pact
Or you’ll never ever, ever get your severed arm back
Whether you are governed by your head or heart that
Is irrelevant when battling the Ebonheart Pact

No-one but the Eight Divines could ever set my destiny
Many men have tried it, now many rest in peace
No-one but the Eight Divines could ever set my destiny
Many men have tried it, now many rest in peace




 Dead if you try, you dead if you try
Mother fuckers dead in the streets
Dead if you try, you dead if you try
Mother fuckers dead in the streets
(Aaaah)

I woke up from unconsciousness, my fellow officers
All slaughtered, my God what the fuck is this?
Not gonna lie, I'm quite scared, colleagues are lying right there
I'm either off my tits or I'm having a nightmare
I enter the site of the mental asylum
Armed with the intention to find whatever the heck is messing my mind up
This best be a wind up, a prank in poor taste
If this is you, Sam Pepper, you've landed a court case
How does a corpse taste? What does it feel like to kill?
To go insane in the brain like you're Cypress Hill?
I can't find my pills, I'm going through withdrawal
Ruined thoughts of doing all sorts of stuff that's truly awful
Mortal wounds and torture scenes, debauchery
The sort of thing that no lawful being ought to see
Proceed with caution, what you see's a distortion
The proportions of reality have been reapportioned
Backstreet abortions, meat, bleeding orphans weep
It's even more nauseous than a rerun of Dawson's Creek
Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins
Take a deeper peak and see the evil within
Now flash back to sunflowers and a country house (Ah)
It looks as if somebody must have let Ted Bundy out
Sebastian Castellanos, crouched and casting shadows
Between the splash damaged couch and the smashed piano
Just give me the chance to vamos and I'll be out of this place
Cause now my trousers are stained, I doubt it helps with the case
I don't remember seeing this in Goat Simulator
Look, I think I better get my coat and go, see you later...

Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins
Take a deeper peak and see the evil within
Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins
Take a deeper peak and see the evil within
Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins
Take a deeper peak and see the evil within
Look that the people you're with, beneath all the grins
Take a deeper peak and see the evil within

Dead if you try, you dead if you try
Mother fuckers dead in the streets
Dead if you try, you dead if you try
Mother fuckers dead in the streets




 Ah ah ah!
Put on my red shoes and fasten up the buckles
Flex and stretch my legs, Oh so supple
Call Amy, Tails and Knuckles
We`re ready for a scuffle
And feathers`ll be ruffled
Amy rose is a lady that knows
How to handle a hammer
Shes aiming the blows
There ain`t no evading the throws
With one little tap she`s breaking your nose
Tails sails through the air like a gale
With chaos trying to take him down to no avail
He`ll scale hills and vales
Valleys and mountains `til we prevail
Knuckles
Is a though old echidna
How he got so big`s an enigma
As a unit they`re lifting the stigma
That woodland creatures have little charisma
Spikes on my back strike and attack
Any lyre, boa, mamba, python or asp
Whiche type of life`s even faster than light?
You`re frightened to ask, it is I
I`m the supersonic sonic im on it
Like a comet at velocities that makes you want vomit
Breaking your sound barrier like a gromet
Would they ever stop me?
Far from it
Im running to the summit
I`m honest, that`s a promise
On every gold ring that i`ve got within my wallet
Bling!
Got to get those rings
Spread those wings
And wreck those things
Disinfect those stings
I`m a retro link to the future
Electro swing
Being blue, sir
Is the next big thing
There`s a spring in my step so let`s go
Thrilling
There`s a pillock called lyric and he`s going to get it
He`ll feel the force of everything were going to give him
The biggest of his wishes is to kick us off the rythm
But were never going to give in
Never going to let him
He`s never going to get anything that he threatened
Whatever the weapon
We`re old school so we`re prepping a lesson
He`ll learn that we`re never subject to agression
We`re the woodland creatures
With grand features
That`ll make you scream for the bleachers
Bringing heat like a fever
With elite beats that`ll give your speakers seizures
Dbs exeeding the reading of the meters
`til you`re pleading for a breather
*ihm, ihm*
While we just beat snake egg enemies to the etheeeeeeeeer
Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow, Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Screw Usain Bolt
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow, Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Screw Usain Bolt
I'm a blue flame bolt
I'm a
I'm a
I'm a blue flame bolt
And a Hedgehog




 Hello, it's Dan Bull
Guinness World Records have challenged me to make a song using content from their books
Guinness World Records 2016, Guinness World Record 2016 Gamer's Edition
I said I could make songs about anything
So uh
Challenge accepted
Here we go

If you're a tortoise
It doesn't matter
You can still be the fastest tortoise on the planet
Practice makes perfect
So put the work in
To succeed isn't free
You've got to earn it
Take every calorie and burn it
Take every curveball that hits you, return it
Take every lesson and learn it
Until the fact you're the best is the verdict
Whether you do it alone or play in a team
The world's one big arcade machine
There's seven billion of us playing
Each unique
Get engaged in the game
And then chase your dream
Take control
Roll with the punches
Break the mold
Take a stroll on your crutches
Refine your craft and your talent
'Til nobody else on the planet can touch it

I want to be the biggest
The strongest
The oldest
The youngest
The fastest
The longest
I wanna be the largest
The tallest
The brightest
The darkest
The hardest
The smallest
I wanna be me
I wanna be the best I can be
I wanna be me
I wanna be the best that I can be

My goodness (x8)
Look
If there's anything the tortoise taught us
It's to never tread water
Never cut corners
To take no quarter
When you break those borders
Whether you
Deform your face
Eat all the grapes
Or crush a biscuit betwixt your shoulder blades
Grow your fingernails out
Run in clogs
Spit flames
Raise funny dogs
What are you the best at?
Better than the rest at?
What are you self taught?
Or genetically blessed at?
Whoever you are there's a record you can set
Fact
When I said you've got potential
I meant that
And approach each unique plan
Two thumbs up
On each hand
Write it down with the world's biggest ball point pen
And then
Do it all again
To the end

I want to be the biggest
The strongest
The oldest
The youngest
The fastest
The longest
I wanna be the largest
The tallest
The brightest
The darkest
The hardest
The smallest
I wanna be me
I wanna be the best I can be
I wanna be me
I wanna be the best that I can be

That was alright, wasn't it?




 Gather around, children
Let me tell a tale, as old
As time itself

A small town sounds quiet as night falls
Clouds hang high up in the sky like tight balls
Observed in silence by the hero that South Park deserves
It's so clear that shit's about to get perverted
If you're of a sensitive disposition
You'd better avert your eyes
This noble coalition's only mission's
Shifting merchandise
And nipping a bit off the top of the profits
As if they were circumsized
We like our gherkins sliced
Supersize the burgers, fries
And milkshake
Our balls are touching in an epic way when worlds collide
Observe the human kite traverse the skies
Presumably carrying some sort of irreconcilable burden that hurts inside
Like when a person dies, or a deflowered virgin cries
This work requires a certain type of individual
Who's willing to do things which oppugn what is permissible
Speak the unthinkable, even if it's unforgivable
It is just irresistible to piss off PC principal
The fate of the race may soon depend
On a group of mutants who defend
The right to be rude, to be crude, offend
Who's the crew in question? Coon and Friends
To the end, it's true, not imaginary
There's no need to pretend
Superheroes are super popular
And we need cash, let's use the trend
A civil war: Several children versus several more
Swivel on my middle finger while I do the devil horns
A cape and costume made of stuff from mummy's knicker drawer
Latex is known to chafe, it may just make your nipples sore
We vigilantes, shift the ante
Shit hits the fan, poor Mr Hanky (hidey ho!)
You're gonna need a Christmas Plan B
You've been exposed, we've ripped your panties
This isn't a game now, it's Jumanji
So pick a faction that'll tickle your fancy
Then amp up the heat of the hell's kitchen
Kids curse more than a certain Mr Ramsey
Sex, pistols, Sids and Nancies
Rotten, Johnnies, filth and anarchy
Swindles, Banshees
And out of date pop culture references to antiques
Superhero v. reckless trolls
I'm a super cereal breakfast bowl
You're next on the checklist though
Getting cancelled like Kenny's Netflix show
Prove the theory on who's Mysterion
If you can't do it, you're a stupid idiot
Buckle up for a new experience
Like a boat full of homeless Syrians
I know this is serious
And it's gonna make motherfuckers furious
But I come from the school where the rule
Is that anything goes if it's hilarious
Mosquito, Toolshed, Tupperware
They'll do whatever they've got to do if it's a double dare
Mint Berry Crunch will punch you with sugar
'Til you crash so hard, people passing by rubberneck
Fucking heck, such swearing's needless
Like the port for Kinect or your penis
Bitch please, Twitch streamers
We're real heroes, you're just Dreamers
Sorry, that was a momentary lapse of control
You could say my state of mind is kind of fractured but whole
In that it's greater than the sum of its parts
Just like the culinary arts
Or the sight and sound and smell of a bum when it farts
That was a fart joke
Hilarious
Although there's dark smoke you can't toke
On it you might choke
Only a hard bloke can face Professor Chaos
Or he might rip out your heart as if you are an artichoke

Shit ending, don't care
Fuck you, Ubisoft
Pay me
Capitalism in action




 I'm not threatening you mate. It's beyond fucking words. I watched over you when you were asleep and I looked at your fucking neck and I was that far away from slicing it. You're fucking there mate! So get in that car... and fuck off

Hello David

Hello, how are you, Dan?

I'm okay. Um, I'm just recording the intro track to my mixtape "Bullmatic", which is a cover mixtape of, uh, Nas' Illmatic. And the first track is basically him talking to this friend. Um, and you're my friend so I thought I'd call you on Skype and talk to you

Okay. Is this it? Are we recording it now?

Yeah, this is it

Oh

And, um, let me see, we've got- we've got a little while longer before track 2 kicks in so... I dunno. Um, I don't- I don't- like in the original version I don't really know what they're talking about so, I guess we could talk about anything

Um, you thirsty?

I- I'm fairly thirsty

(chuckles) You want a cup of coffee, or something?

Um, yeah. After I've recorded this, I'll go and put the kettle on, and um... I mean, obviously the people listening will go on and listen to track 2 but we can have a chat while they're listening to track 2

Alright

See ya

Bye

Ok, this is Bullmatic




 Hello sir, good morning
Please answer the door
We’ve been knocking for an hour
And we’d really like your attention for a second
We’ve a message for you
Bless you
Yes, you need to hear the good news
Of our Saviour, our blessed destiny manifest
Let me tell you about our Lord and Saviour, Kanye West

Kanye loves you
And you should love Kanye
More importantly Kanye loves Kanye
Kanye is the brightest
The best and the boldest
And we know this
Because Kanye Told us

He wakes in the morning with his flawless skin
In an enormous four poster bed and he grins
Jawline to die for plus he’s married to Kim
In a gorgeous Fur coat that he’s already in
And you can forget cologne
Kanye farts pure pheromones
A full length mirror by the bog
Watch the Throne
See he makes the best cup of tea
He only uses half a sugar but it tastes like three
He steps out of his mansion if the skies are grey
Claps his hands and the fans come and brighten his day
He waves to the waiting paparazzi
Passes a tray of lemonade
And a plate of panda pasties
It’s not nasty
That he should make a tasty snack, see
They’re mating in his garden
And he’s bringing back the species
Then he sees and fistbumps the postman
Praise Yeezus!
More fanmail to open


When I say he’s from the street
I mean he’s on the street
Greeting everyone he meets
And it’s beyond belief
Knocked up my wife with a high five
The highlight of my life
Sired a child on my behalf
My, what a nice guy
I know right
But with genetics this miraculous
Why would he even need to remix his ejaculate?
When asexual eugenics is exceedingly spectacular
Erection?
Fabulous!
Conception?
Miraculous!
He sleeps with Kim for fun, but he really doesnt need to
When Kanye reproduces he splits like an amoeba
He’s the key to prevent humanity’s destruction
He can build IKEA flatpacks without the instructions
He transcends the proletariat’s class struggle
He can travel through time
And he can juggle


He visited the third world, made dirty water sanitized
Met an orphan girl and Autotuned her daddy back to life
Brought peace to the Middle East
And ceased global conflict
Manipulates the world so it’s just the way he wants it
Reiterates for all that he can silence the racists
Who are you to say he’s not the first black spaceship?
Leaps into the sky seeding life on other planets
The universe can’t even exist without him, can it?
What’s triggered this?
He’s shrieking his lungs out
He's talking gibberish and speaking in tongues
Wow




 I'm going to record your voice
And then play it back to you on the same machine
This is brilliance, lastest thing from America
I-I-I'm a royal who
T-T-T-T-Toils to
B-Be-B-Be the best rapper
To ever have a stammer
These amateur men are just imitators to the throne
But I'm the king of this thing, look at the bling on my dome
Who do you know that can r-rewind selecta
Without the D-D-D-DJ pressing rewind on the decks
I possess a p-p-p-p-p-particular enunciation
Mixed with a p-peculiar pronunciation
M-Make a joke of the way that I say things
I'll p-p-p-p-punch your face in!
I s-s-suffer from a
S-s-stammer, but it
D-Doesn't stop me d-d-doing what I can about it
I s-suffer from a
S-s-stammer but it
Doesn't stop me doing what I bloody well can about it!
Rap's a very good form of therapy for me
Because the r-rhythm provides precision preventing me from stalling
Like a propellor on a f-fighter plane
That's falling from the sky
In blazes, forming tighter phrases
All the time, amazing
All with my displays of
Tongue twisting, lung stretching
Bum clenching greatness I make you stop!
S-Stammer time!
Helpless. Helpless!




 We spoke unspoken things
We rode on broken wings
We wrote a symphony with broken bows and broken strings
We harmonized to bring each other simple hope from hymns
We spoke unspoken things
We rode on broken wings

I still remember the day that I met you
To begin with, I didn't quite get you
And I bet you didn't get me
When you sneezed and I said bless you
Remember the days of getting acquainted
We were chained together with pain
But yet its the same tether that made a friendship
That no oppressor could tame
We severed the chain
Shedding the weight
And made a clever escape
Through terrible weather and flame
Frayed fur and feathers never the same
Together we celebrate
Commiserate
Share treasure and blame
By any given measure you make
We're the best the better the best of mates
We spoke unspoken things
We rode on broken wings
We wrote a symphony with broken bows and broken strings
We harmonized to bring eachother simple hope from hymns
Akin to lowly folk and kings sharing a token drink
Opening a link once closed
To simply sit like bros and sing
We broke the mould
And showed the whole world what we both can bring
But a pin that's soaked in ink
And poked in skin can only sting
Like broken bones, broken oaths or broken wings

So just carry me and I'll lead you
Shelter me and I'll feed you
Hear me and I'll see you through
Together we do whatever we need to do

I still remember the day that I met you
To begin with, I didn't quite get you
And I bet you didn't get me
When I leaned in with an attempt to pet you
But with you I'm not scared to share the real me
Just knowing you care can heal me
I swear fealty
Can you feel me?
I'll be a sword if you shield me
Might never get a chance to say goodbye
When its too late you're gone
We two may be separated
But it's you that made me one
When I'm away please stay strong
Remember what it takes to break these bonds
Place oceans and seas between us
They'll seem like lakes and ponds
I care about your whereabouts
I'm bare without you
Share yourself with me
Feel free to dare to doubt
I swear I'm there to help
My prayers go out to thee
You're tearing down the scary towers
Bearing down
And staring out
And glaring down at me
There's no bounds to what were amounting to
To what you and a pal can do
Insurmountable mountains
Become minuscule mounds
When we meld as two
I keep the principles you held us to (always)
And they help us through
Still here when I'm out of view
That chill you felt I felt it too
That chill you felt I felt it too
So

Carry me and I'll lead you
Shelter me and I'll feed you
Hear me and I'll see you through
Together we do whatever we need to do
Together we do whatever we need to do




 The fungus' hunger
Has plundered and plummeted us
From the humdrum to the hunted
As the county crumbles to dust
The life of a surviver's living in quarantine
This isn't a holiday
This is military policy
There's a rift, as emboldened
We shift the balance of power
I'm just a citizen: Joel
Unwilling man of the hour
Cause all I want to do is end it
But my solitude depends
On whether I fulfill
An old promise to a friend
I've smuggled guns
I've smuggled diamonds and pearls
But I've never been entrusted
With the life of a girl
I must ride beside her to the Fireflies
Mind's in a whirl
They might as well reside
The other side of the world

THE LAST OF US
It's a new definition
Of the term "urban jungle"
THE LAST OF US
Shit hasn't gone viral
Its gone fungal

Infected detected
Tote the pistol, load clips
These filthy clothes show
That it's a twisted road trip
I'm ragged and smelly
Might as well act like a scally
And smack a chap's scalp in
With a bat in an alley
How many's that we've capped then
Captain O'Malley
It'd take an honor student graduate
Of math for the tally
In the past me and Ellie
For having massacred many
Would have made a prime time
Newscast on the telly
You bastards are jelly
You're just going to have to get ready
For us to blast brain matter
On the map like confetti
I school undead with tools
Combust them up efficiently
Like fuel unleaded
Leave the fools unheaded
And if they're dumb enough
To come up wrangling with me
Then I leave cadavers mangled
As they dangle from a tree
And on a planet this unglamorously bleak
You should probably be thankful to be free

THE LAST OF US
It's a new definition
Of the term "urban jungle"
THE LAST OF US
Shit hasn't gone viral
Its gone fungal




 It’s. The. Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test?
Going face, to face with the best of the best
In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test?
Based on your base, well I never would have guessed

Look, I was never a chap
To simply select between defend and attack
So if anyone asks for trouble
I’m going to be doubly sending them back
The throne is mine
I’m ending any pretender to that
I’m sensing a lack of courage
Such that you won’t even reach the end of the track
I’ve been training at dawn
Every day to be ready for the Great Big Battle
Evading traps all day while I’m raiding castles
And I’m aiming at fools with such deviousness
That it’s even leaving mages baffled
Debasers, Crabs or gelatinous walls
I’m hacking them all
Jabbing and brawling, having a ball
And sending them packing their bags in the hall
If Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
Then I probably hit him

It’s the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test?
Going face, to face with the best of the best
In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test?
Based on your base, well I never would have guessed
(Pay attention!)

I’m raiding your mates, and taking everything that they bought
I fought them in their forts, blood sport’s the way it’s paid for
And I’m a great sport, wielding a greatsword
Treat your face like I’m walloping a baseball
I drop the Painhammer, like my surname
And I certainly know to make the most of my fame
Man, I treat merchandising opportunities as prudently
As a morbidly obese Beastman would treat the food he eats
I’m a greedy bugger
Me and my money, we need each other
I’m bringing enough bling
To sting the vision of Stevie Wonder
I’m applying oceans, of potions
Like lotion, ‘til I’m not even trying
I’m just going through the motions

It’s the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test?
Going face, to face with the best of the best
In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test?
Based on your base, well I never would have guessed

The sight of my castle’s really something in the sky
Your is as useless as a Cyclops with something in its eye
And in particular, a chicken as vicious as this is ridiculous
I think an efficient and fitting prescription is if we could give them Barbiturates
I’m clad in heavy armour, you’re dressed like a belly dancer
Your smelly archers made me catch my breath, Kelly Clarkson
I lunge a lot at Hungerbots and snotty Snottinghams
And any funds they drop, well I’ll probably pocket them
I poke my sword at the Terroraptor Overlord
Quick, grab the stash, and throw ourselves overboard
It’s the only life I know, it’s how I do things
In Opulencia you get rich or die looting

It’s the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test?
Going face, to face with the best of the best
In the Mightiest Quest, are you ready for the test?
Based on your base, well I never would have guessed

It just keeps. Getting. Better!




 We came out of the nineties nicely
With our eyes on the prize, it was pipe dreams
But surprise, surprise, there were crises
And we learned that the world wasn't quite as sweet
As we'd have liked it to be, the price to be free
Skyrocketed and what we did was a sight to see
America, the nation that Westeners obey
In exchange for protection engaged in an election
It was famously contested so with baited breath
The world's gaze headed Westward
With the battle of the ballots hanging in the balance
There was a lack of ballast in who would inhabit the palace
And in Bush and Gore's manic rush to the door
There was a panic and all planning was pushed to the floor
The winner was a mystery, so it was handed to the courts
Who handed it to George and Bush was given victory
And in an instant, Clinton's stint
Of stability - well it was history
We met the neighbours, they made us get acquainted
With the daily dangers that they're facing
They took a plane and they made it change destination
To shake a great Western nation
And the pain of that day made the next generation
Of patriots praying for good or baying for blood
Terror attacks in America taxed
The president's head to the max, not yet to mention Iraq
The inevitable reaction in Afghanistan
Was the centre of a grander plan
And to spread democratic values
They sent in the tanks to get the fanatical Taliban radicals
The massive collateral damage
Was classed as manageable, act casual
And the militant killing of a million civilians
Is merely a stat on the graph on the manager's wall
So that was war number one
And it's all going on still but there's more to come
After the Taliban in Afghanistan
We attacked Saddam in Baghdad, Iraq
They said "trust, he's hiding weapons of mass destruction"
But it's come to light that that was a construction
There was a hurricane, too, and a tsunami
That harmed more humans than a crusading army
Or a Jihadi militant targeting Madrid
Ripping innocents apart in the name of Allah
In the Blitz Brits used to shelter in tube stations
Now there's a new danger and they're not too safe, but

Everything's going to be alright now
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright now
Everything's going to be alright

There's a new fellow in the White House
It was a momentous event 'cause he's light brown
I guess America should be quite proud
But he's already won the peace prize - how?
He needs to pull the peace pipe out
And have a draw before he can ease my doubts
But evidently the presidency can go to any man
Who reckons Yes He Can
It's a messy planet, full of stress and panic
We better learn from the lessons
Of the past and do better than it
There's many bad things we can prevent with action
So forget the distractions and accept the challenge
Darfur, Georgia, Iran, Palestine
Famine, Swine Flu, and Michael Jackson died
Global warming, CFCs, global war, WMDs
HDTV, DVDs, Blu-Ray, MP3s, PCs
IPods, laptops, Blackberries, flatscreen
Broadband, MySpace, Facebook, Twitter feeds
And there's still killings in the Middle East
We don't even see, on the BBC news stream
We're like the people in Korea, being decieved
The real world's hiding behind a screen of fear
Immediate media means that we're free to believe
Anything that we see or read in Wikipedia
We're in a different league to those a decade ago
Though it was only yesterday - no?
They brought back Die Hard, brought back Rambo
Rocky Balboa and Indiana Jones
Throwbacks to the days where we felt safe
That's why Take That are back again
The twelfth of May two thousand and eight
A hell of a day; a powerful mountainous quake
Killed thousands and razed the surroundings
Down in its wake, how can we take it?
Tell me it's fate 'cause I'm doubting my faith
But hope takes more than a foul thing to break
Trust, look around and there's faces counting on change
We've got the power to get out of the chains
Does it sound very strange right now that there's slaves
That are labouring eighteen hours a day?
We can help them to break out when we say
"Down with the pain," now we've found ourselves again
The smell, the taste, it's real, can you feel that?
Now, today; the people have a real chance

Everything's going to be alright now
Everything's going to be alright
Everything's going to be alright now
Everything's going to be alright

Well, that was the noughties
And not since the nineteen forties
Have we seen this much economic recession;
Have we seen this much aggression
But we're still going strong, still holding on tight
We're going to be alright
Because we're still going strong, still holding on tight
We're going to be alright




 Forget the Rancor, Daniel’s in the lion’s lair
I’m a starfighter, you’re flying Ryanair
I visited BioWare, dined on their chinaware
With a pipe, a pair of slippers and reclining chair
I’m aware my rare dialect’s more fluent than a protocol droid
With a rhyming flair
I’m getting quite a strain in my neck ok
‘cos I’ve got a bigger brain than a Twi’lek
Yep
I’m called Dan, I’m a Star Wars fan
Far more than you, I’m hardcore, man
From Korriban to Coruscant
Alderaan to Dromund Kaas
I drop the hottest raps
I am the top of the class
I’m a Jedi Knight, led by my skill
To kill whoever I like
I’m a murderer, you’re a nerf herder, bruh
I got ya coffin, I don’t mean tubercular
Ha!
I’m an Imperial Agent, you’re merely a vagrant
Look, Jabba the Hutt’s butt’s nearly as fragrant
I can take a track about the Old Republic
And make it so banging it becomes a club hit
I’m a bounty hunter about to plunder
The Senate for 100,000 Credits
So no doubt you wonder just how I get it
Bumping louder than the sound of thunder

You’re more annoying than a crowd of Gungans
A bloody Ewok could get you out your bunker
I’m a Sith Inquisitor
You’re nothing but a Gullipud Prannock
I’m a Planetary Governor
And I’m a smuggler, you’re ugly
Your balls haven’t dropped, you must be a juggler
Rub-a-dub, three dugs in a tub
Two of them are being buggered
So you must be the buggerer
Space hustler, straight huffing
And then puffing and then blowing
Your space station up
In a ball of flame, no ball and chain
‘cos I take no prisoners, I’m causing pain
A devout Sith, straight out the mythology
Taking out Colonies easy, you’re helpless
I easily leave each of you outlived, yeah
You should have a bad feeling about this

Dan Bull
I've got a massive collection of original Star Wars figures
Many in the original packaging
I've got Yakface. I've got YAKFACE
Type in 'Yakface action figure' on eBay
That's how I roll




 Order!
Order!
Let the right honourable gentleman speak
Ahhhhh

These dark streets creep with Half-Breeds
We can't see through the smog; the deep fog falls
We can't breathe
We can't seem to keep the peace, appease the beast
Police the streets easily, you see
We have been seemingly waging a war
Ceaselessly since the days of yore and ages before
We came from the court of King Arthur
And we've been battling happily ever after
Knights in shining armor never died; a timeless martyr
We ride from by the harbour to the heart of night and farther
So hide inside your parlour
Unless you'd like to try to find whose knives are sharper
I will slice you like a barber
But the demons of Fleet Street aren't Sweeney Todd
Barbarically to Half-Breeds, he's a teeny dot
It's like likening the hijabi to a bikini top
I know, these asynchronous references should really stop

The Order is heading for war
More important than ever before
The Order is heading for war
And I warn you, we'd better be Ready At Dawn

So, in no particular order, let me introduce the Order
First of all, there's me, Sir Percival
The author of this verse I rip with vicious flow
And then there's Isabeau
What's that? No realistic women in gaming? Is it though?
She's wicked, bro, I haven't met a classier lassie yet
And I'll bet you'll laugh at the banter with Lafayette
Sir Galahad's a gallant lad, so glad I had him gallop
Had I not, the team would be approximately
Three quarters as bad as that
Together, we're battling infestation of perverted termites
And instead of bug killer, we've thermite
Turing the searchlight on them 'til we hit the turnpike
And despite the dark, the lights in our hearts will burn bright
Like a burning zeppelin, and by my reckoning
We've earned the right to eternal life in Heaven
So God better let us in
And by my reckoning
We've earned the right to eternal life in Heaven
So God better let us in


Order
O-o-o-o-order
O-o-o-o-order
O-order




 There's a delicate line between a friend
And something else
And I've never been quite sure
How to tell

Heard words that weren't there in your body language
As a buddy I thought I had an advantage
I knew you, you knew me
And I briefly believed in the power of magic
Seeing you smile was the ultimate pleasure
Fishing for compliments, I was hunting for treasure
Summoned to heaven, platonic love becoming untethered
The way you'd comfort me when under the weather
And how we'd cuddle together under your umbrella
You must think I'm such a dumb fellow
I'd have done better leaving it alone
Even if I'd known we were going to grow; be with different folks
I was going to plant a seed and let it grow free
Then an oak tree develops slowly
Now the leaves on my future family tree
Are fruits imaginary
And I'm so lonely
Oh, me...


Tighten up your bowtie
'cause guys in your position don't cry
Do not be frightened - really you won't die
Your deeds and writings reveal you both sides
Lighting up on the roadside
Driving over the strobe light

It's the rise of defiant Dan; I'm a quiet man
But still spent time inside in a riot van
Blindsided without the benefit of hindsight
My eyes were as wide as a frying pan
You might summise I'm devising a higher plan
Redesigning my life with an iron hand
It's now or never
I've got to pull myself together
Can't waste days staying in the house forever
Come out to the desert
Now there's a westerly breeze
Please, I need help with the zephyr
You could knock me down with a feather
But I'll still be grinning with the mouth of a Cheshire
My last album was a hell of an effort
Daniel wrote the manual on how to endeavour
And if ever there was a doubt that I'm clever
It's down to the fact that my talent's without measure
I've found treasure now my business is pleasure
I can infinitely tessellate my lyrics at leisure
And any way you spin it, it just gets fresher
An intricately illustrating MC... Escher

The quiet viking is how I'm known, I
I'm strident in style, although shy
And I don't even know why
So I'm either enlightened or I'm just so high
I can see the lighting upon the roadside
Driving over the strobe light

The quiet viking
The quiet viking
(The quiet viking) (x4)




 I used to be trapped in the elevator
Waiting for fate to favour me
Then I realised that in real life
Nothing would be handed on a plate to me
Before I deserved dessert
I'd have to taste the savoury
Each and every flavour
Even when it'd make me heave
Remember to say your Ps and Qs
Please may I leave the table reasonably soon?
I'd stay for tea
But I've got faces to see, places to be
Basically I'm dedicated to chasing the dream
I've been making believe for so long
I was unable to see me go wrong

Step up
Step back
Step off
Step to it
(x2)

I used to be trapped in the elevator
Doors slammed together in my face
But I grabbed them and seperated them
'til my hands had gone red and aching
Then I made plans to elevate manually
Hand me a pen and paper
Now allow me to demonstrate
That even my acapella could make
The whole track collapse like there was a quake
I'm faster than any race car
They tagged me the devastor
It's a fact that I'll never give way
Til I'm dead or at number ten
Replacing David Cameron, Clegg
And named the greatest rapper to ever pave the way
Cos I made this staircase

[Verse 3
Step 1:
Learn your lessons and take criticism
It'll enable you to make it bigger
Step 2:
Keep it real, stay true to you
You don't need to be anyone else
Because you are you
Step 3:
Enjoy every syllable you deliver
Whether it's ignorant or lyrical
Whether it's simplistic or difficult
Step 4:
Always remember that everything you do is yours
And that should be the reason you do music for




 A cup of Fairy Ale isn’t much if not accompanied
By some bardic poems and songs

For a thousand years, the battle has been waged
But there’s strange tidings, the tides of war are sure to change
We live in sinister times, there’s an imminent fight
Bigger than Kyle’s mom, have you seen her behind?
A hero will rise, he needs to be wise
And Jews can’t be saviours, so it’s best he isn't circumcised
There’s whisperings around these parts of a new kid
There’s a house on Fuller Street that they say he moved in
I hear tell he’s a muteling, he doesn’t speak much
It has nothing to do with the game’s pre-release budget
We need a saviour greater than the Dragonborn
Let me consult my magic tome stashed away within this stack of porn
There’s Cartman, Grand Wizard ruling Kupa Keep
Where you can barter, buy some armour or just find some food to eat
This is the tent in which we kept the Stick of Truth but see
Clyde had one job, and he messed it up quite stupidly
And so now, new kid, it’s up to you to seek
And return the Stick to its place to break the losing streak
Let us proceed in this hour of darkness
With the courage of dragons, and the power of fart mist
Through towers and arches, we scour the territories
Whether showers or fire pits, disembowel our enemies
The sourest hardships will never defeat our people
We keep releasing lethal farts that are without equal
An ancient secret: the Nagasaki Fart
Leave you with a bleeding nose and looking like you party hard
With such an epic quest, you need a band of merry men
To dig up buried treasure chests and see you to the very end
Butters is a Paladin, Stan’s a Warrior with A.D
Kenny is a Princess, don’t ask why, that’s how he’s rolling lately
And Kyle finally acknowledges his true self
As he transmutes into the form of a High Jew Elf
So go forth now, blow the war horn
I will stay and guard the Keep and maybe look at more porn
Use your power shrewdly, or never see your enemy fall
Because one does not simply fart on anyone’s balls
Battle Underpants Gnomes, Goblins and Vampire Kids
The town relies on you to undo that which has been did
In you we trust, I've prophesied your destiny
Put an end to evil in the nuts like a vasectomy




 I've got this
I've got this
I've got this

I'm slowly roasting under the solar rays
Been stuck in this hole for days
What virtuoso made the oh-so great proposal
Of drones with blades
Hey, don't separate my nose and face
My looks will go to waste
I was low a moment ago
But pain's a way to motivate
I don't suppose they'll float away
So I'll make a new way to negotiate
I, turn over the page with no delay
I'm my own protege
I'm a dark soul with two hard shoulders
Known as the motorway
So don't you dare overtake
Or you'll need a new coat of paint
Severing extremities is a clever method
We use to lose a load of weight
Your tech's like your culture:
Free for me to go and appropriate
Those flows provoke debate
Blowing up at an explosive rate
So debased I won't associate with you
You're overrated
I'd prefer to go on a date
With a moldy plate of roast potatoes
Craving so voracious I could float in space
And won't be weightless
How the heck did I get so big?
Sticking tech to my exo rig
But it's never sufficient
I'm already getting ready for the next growth
So let's go dig

Never mind the gods and their schemes
We are the cogs in their machine
The wildest fighting dogs you've ever seen
Blood
Petrol
Metal
Sweat and dreams

Adapt to stress, disaster
Like a committed method actor
No happy ever after
A vicious metal raptor
With the extra X factor
Collecting tech scrap for
The aptitudes I have to yet master
Get faster
Test, you'll get your neck snapped
So It's messed up like It's Glen Baxter's sketchpad
That's drenched in alphabet pasta
Sepp blatter
Deceptive bastard
Fully fledged engine of vengeful havoc
A tragic ending's pending
When you're a drunk trying to enter traffic
Shrapnel spins severed limbs
Liquidating everything
From megaliths
To insignificant details we see the devil in
We go to the CREO party
Dismantle the demonarchy
Don't start when you can't complete
Or your arteries will receive no heartbeat

Never mind the gods and their schemes
We are the cogs in their machine
The wildest fighting dogs you've ever seen
Blood
Petrol
Metal
Sweat and dreams


I've got this
Someone call a doctor
I've got this
Doctor, I've got this urge
But I'm lost for words
Feel like I'm on the verge of popping off
Do not disturb
Call off the search
I've lost my nerve
Giving you just desserts
I'm kicking you off of the kerb
My golly gosh, that must have hurt

(Never mind!)
Never mind the gods and their schemes
We are the cogs in their machine
The wildest fighting dogs you've ever seen
Blood
Petrol
Metal
Sweat and dreams




 News is the tool that is abused to fool
You and to leave you scared and confused
Trews is like the news if the news was true
I want some trews! Let's have some trews!

(How'd you dooo?)
It's David unbiased v Goliath of liars
It's coming straight from the highest
Rapacious place of deniers
Who might just break in the face of defiance
Making alliance, spread like contagion and viruses
Violent fires and riots are not the way that we make them retire
Nah, we make it a science
Changing the minds of the nation
Break the supply and the chain should
Fade and then dry up, deny the paper Messiah
And face him straight in the eye
And I proclaim it a triumph (Elementary!)
You haven't got to be Sherlock to see
That Rupert Murdoch's obscene
A dude that murders the meaning
Of truth and turns it to green
They serve a political agenda
Take words and then stick them in a blender
Never give a shit on whether it'll offend you
Outing a gay politician as a bender
We discussed it, we're disgusted!
Given up on even trying to trust it
Step on up and get a better look
As I chuck a mega left hook at Rebekah Brooks
No punches pulled, don't pull the wool over Bull
You won't fool us all, we've no senses dulled
You, you've no sense at all

News is the tool that is abused to fool
You and to leave you scared and confused
Trews is like the news if the news was true
I want some trews! Let's have some trews!

I have more things to say

Newspapers use acres of trees to make us believe
There is a reason the name is "make believe"
Pied papers are plaguing the streets
Hate's a seed and when you plant it
It propagates like a weed 'til you stamp it
I hate to be so pedantic
But in the papers I see the semantics
Like I'm reading a pamphlet on ways
You can be sycophantic to media magnates
I'm not going to let you feed me a sandwich
Of the sneakiest devious language
To seize the advantage of people in grief
And in anguish seems underhanded
Consequently we feel disenchanted and rant at it
In the manner Russel Brand did
It's called not taking freedom for granted
It's the reason I'm free to be candid
To rap about deviant antics
Like taking my penis and wanking it
Hey! We lower the tone! Page 3, throw us a bone!
Tabloids make you sick for weeks
So stick broadsheets 'twixt your cheeks
Use them to brush the poo that's encrusted
Just like glue to the tuft of pubes on your nuts
We're wiping out bums, booties and butts with your views
And the loos have been flushed
There ain't no news you can trust:
All points of views are corrupt
Them, me, you and even Russ
To an extent we're all deluded and bluffed
But would you figure us to collude to corrupt
In a cruel and unjust and inhuman abuse
Of your customers' trust and deluge them with guff
Titillation, boobies and lust
Who's in a state with the booze and the drugs
Or their bruises and cuts and who's upper crust?
Clue: when you're stuck to deduce a spoof from the truth
It is prudent to look for proof in the fluff
It may take humour and guts but we refuse to give up
Even if we look kind of stupid and stuff
Who gives a fuck?!

News is the tool that is abused to fool
You and to leave you scared and confused
Trews is like the news if the news was true
I want some trews! Let's have some trews!




 Sometimes the lifeboat to which our hope is tethered
Is but a floating feather
Blown in zephyrs in the soaking weather
The mist and the smoke envelop
A mystery, a missed envelope
An unopened letter
Wrote instead of
Letting these emotions
Go through the motions, ever
Hope is a coping method
Is a mechanism
Letting us get rid of the foreboding peril
Say no to the Devil
To the toad in the hole
That we know can control
On a whole new level
Mill wheel turning
Fear will turn into cheer
Chilled, flowing in vessels
How long have we known each other?
Would you rather go alone instead of
Getting thrown together
With a ghost in a lonesome bed
I bet it goes through your head, huh?
If we won't keep our head up
And we don't keep ahead
I bet we won't keep our head above the ocean
Then and we'll recede to the seas
That are deep below these heavens
Knees trembling
He sees us... Jesus
For a hesitant moment there, I was froze in terror
With a phobic tremor
That stoic heroics never extinguish
Spoken in the most elegant English
Flash! Lightning, fires fade
Ash, rising, sky ablaze
Some of us die and raise to a higher place
Others just lie in wait in a hiding place
With a frightened face
Eyes agape and gazing vacant
Waiting patiently
Pacing aimlessly
To syncopated beats
We need to face the things we hate to see
Embrace the things we hate to say we need
And that's hard to do
How can we start anew?
When it feels like we're just half-way through
The last chapter, the last part, and now we're starting two
But in my heart of hearts I knew
That this is what I've got to do
True. And when I'm in the zone
I'll never be alone with you
You tenderly approach
Your presence is a glow
Put a hand on my shoulder, friend
And hold me, hold me, hold me close
Hold me close
Hold me close
Hold me close
Hold me close
Hold me close
Hold me close




 (Look, this is Fabletown)
The place where fables are found
Grimy roads replace the yellow bricks
Paved on the ground
(How many of them stay here?)
I’m unable to count
Because labelled as outcasts
They stay underground
(They keep themselves to themselves)
Invisible among these mundies
(They use a spell to repel)
Every community needs a way to keep in order
(Someone to police the place)
A sort of senior lawman
Formerly the Big Bad Wolf
They call him Bigby
(Went from eating kids to drinking neat whisky)
When lying alone at night
I don’t quite know why
He’s got the hots for Snow White
(I know, right?)
All it took to hook him long ago
Was a lone bite
It was so wrong (Yet so right)
In Fabletown they face a daily struggle
To escape the place they came from
And the range of ways
That they can raise up trouble
(Dark forces want to see this place
Razed to rubble but Bigby’s a razor blade
Erasing any trace of stubble)
Perhaps one too many close shaves
Check the mirror, see things a little clearer
The answer’s getting nearer
He needs to keep his fellow fables
Out of harm’s way
Be they in Bullfinch Street
Or at the farm, hey
Stop crying over spilt milk
(Pick up the dairy pail)
And dig up the truth
That’s hidden underneath this fairy tale

You better beware, for there’s a wolf among us
But the truth is the food for which he hungers




 I'm a dastardly master thief
The chance of you actually catching me
Is but minimal I've maximum mastery
Mastered each of my skills to the max, you see
That's the key
I treat combat as last and least
Because I vastly prefer sneaking past with ease
But if I have to, I'll attack from the back, crack
Snatch your key and stash that in my knapsack
This isn't the way the planet has to be
Handcrafted skills killed by factories
Fat cats are treating talent nastily
Somebody has to redress the balance and it's me

I'm a thief, a man upon a mission
I'm a shadow in the corner of your vision
Taking all your things with no need for permission
I'm a man upon a mission, I'm a thief
(2x)

Freedom lies where I hide in the shadows
I desire to strike into the light
Like the flight of an arrow
I creep through the narrow streets
And the breeze sends a shiver through my marrow, see
I haven't much left in the war chest
So I best make a quick trip, visit Baron Northcrest
There's a right tyrant
So I might have to end my silence
And get a mite violent
Cause if I don't
Then Orion'll be vying for a fight
And his style and aggressiveness
In Rhetoric are quite diametrical to mine
He'd rather break a window
I tend to pull the blinds


I lived in a realm that I doubt was jocund
But this new town's nought but rotten
Greed and disease and the sound of coughing
Drowned out by the crowd in the House of Blossoms
We could recrown it in the House of Sodom
There's a sea of people out need help but sod them
Leave it long enough it'll be no doubt forgotten
Like the time Xiao Xiao said I felt her bottom
I hear the tick tock of the tower clock and
It means I better nip off out for shopping
Prowl atop inns, the crippled burrick pub
Down I drop into the city that I love
The pinnacle of criminals; I slip in from above
A night owl with the philosophic mission of a dove
When there's no one left to police the streets
And keep the peace
You best leave it to me
The thief
Peace




 Dear David Cameron

You want us to admit if porn's something we're interested in?
I've never heard a more intrusive line of questioning
There's a lot of chaps with no-one to put their erection in
You've put the onus on their boners to come and confess the thing
Despite its popularity, the silence will be deafening
Censorship is not the method to mop up the mess we're in
Next you'll be suggesting police kettling
Any people sending text messages with three Xs in
Will I still be free to see 'The Exorcist'?
Cause there's a crucifix in that and a tween having sex with it
If not, what's the difference between an adult actress
And a thespian in a sexually-packed script?
You plan to block pages with a blacklist
So if I say "rape", does it mean I can't rap this?
In terms of sexual deviance, the Tories have had practice
Dave, I've seen the stains on your Brasenose mattress
And it's ironic you're proposing a porn ban, cause
You're considered one of Britain's biggest wankers

Human rights are universal
Cultural differences are not an excuse to water down human rights
Nor can the exploitation of digital networks by criminals or terrorists
Be a justification for states to censor their citizens

"But think of the children! Think of the children!
A free and open internet's probably gonna kill them!
Think of the children! Think of the children!
A free and open internet's probably gonna kill them!"

Mate, rape fantasies are a common obsession
But actually being a rapist is not a logical progression
To beat abuse, you should use a new weapon
Like battling the stigma for people when confessing
That they've been molested, or beaten senseless
The way that they're treated by police is horrendous
Some of us understand, Louise Mensch does
The consensus is that your dumb plan's defenseless
Tories are all about family responsibility
So your proposal seems silly to me
Serious criminals don't use Bing
They use P2P and darknet webrings
China's blacklist accuracy couldn't be lower
It's like trying to trim your 'fro with a mower
When has censorship ever fixed a problem?
Yeah, it's not like North Korea's got them
But if that's the kind of thing for which you're clamouring
Do you mind if I refer to you as Kim-Jong Cameron?


If you can't say "fuck", you can't say
"FUCK DAVID CAMERON WITH A PIECE OF SLIGHTLY UNDERCOOKED BROCCOLI!"




 The 1980s was a time of strife
The Falklands War, the miners' strikes
The poor got poorer
While all of the fat cats had the time of their life
Now Shaun was a troubled lad
Who could have had a family, could have had a mum and dad
But his dad went away and wasn't coming back
And he just wanted someone to understand that fact
And that's exactly what happened one day in a dank underpass
It'd come to pass that some cunts were laughing
At his mum's fashion and he'd had enough of that
He come across a couple of lads
Having a chuckle that asked him what was up? What's the matter?
So he told them the answer
And they brightened him right up with their banter
Til Gadget come back with a grudge and some cans and demanded
"budge or I'll batter you"
So Shaun goes home alone
He knows the ropes of the fuckery that's happening
He roams the lonely roads and knows there's no-one to trust and be happy with
But next day there's a tap on the pane of his glass
It came from the path and it's Gadget
He's asking if Shaun wants to play
But Shaun isn't sure what to say
Woody wants to know would he want to go because he's sorry for the other day
Boys will be boys, buildings destroyed with military toys
The voiceless youth amused by noise, abuse
Let Loose, an excuse to avoid the truth
Loosen the noose for a moment
'til they have to go home to a home that's hopeless
New shoes just won't cut it
You want to let your hair down? go and cut it
A new suit, boots and braces, new mates to play with, share the pain with
Parents hate it, scared of changes
And letting their little tearaways get away with it
They're at an age where they'll go to parties
And be exposed to the harsh things
It's hard being dark seeing as the friends of your friends are incredibly right wing
He can't mean what he says, he's a mate but
He's asking you whether you're Jamaican or English
Because your skin's different to his
He considers you insidious
Then shit begins to get serious
How did we get here to this?
Giving a talk on the British and forces
Being killed in the war in the Falklands
Then Shaun took a swing at him all because this was the war where he nearly was orphaned
Awful things happen, you have to draw a line, with a choice to walk away or stay behind
Combo saw what the naked eye couldn't
The pain inside Shaun that made him ripe
For the patriots' fight for the land
So he made them shake hands and say goodbye
Sad, but it must be. It was time to take a drive, and travel the country
And after the National Front meet
Sean got moved from the back to the front seat
Truly one of the gang and a thug, see
That's when things really began to get ugly
Tagging profanities in backstreets
Bashing Pakistanis and black peeps
Threatening to slash cheeks
A new flag and a tat on the back of the hand, That's for keeps
Our protagonist seems to have forgotten how to ask for sweets
These acts in the past were petty
But who can backchat to a machete
Brandished by an angry fascist heavy?
"put that away Meggy, your ass is sweaty"
Gadge and the lads grabbed fags and bevvies, cans of Pepsi
Ran back Through the entry, left the shop totally messy
Adrenaline sent Combo in a frenzy
Head red, heart hopeless and empty
It's a headwreck why folks are unfriendly
To people of a different origin
Cos what has skin got to do with it, we're all wandering
Through the shit
The human condition is truly a mission for a lunatic to live in
So we stick to wishing each other well
As long as we think that they're wishing it as well
That's why they gave the Asian living hell
Before baking a cake now they're giving it to Smell
Skins have relationship issues as well
And given the days he's been living in a cell
Can you blame Combo for his difficulties now?
There isn't much to dwell on for prisoners but how long
Until they're coming out
But I tell you this, getting blitzed isn't really gonna help...
Sitting in a flat getting fried with a black guy
Issues in the back of your mind as he acts like
He's got everything you never had and wish you did
Rubbing it in your face, who is this kid
Immigrant from another race taking British priviliges
A nigga, ripping the piss
Gonna give him a kick in the face
A bit of discipline'll stick him in his place, a sickening disgrace
Beat him senseless; he's defenceless
Leave your friend bleeding, please just end this
Immediately the grief and regret sets in
Left one of your best friends with his head Decked in
You better get checked in to the A and E
Lock yourself up, chuck away the Key
When the world's on your shoulders you've got to be a soldier because
Real men don't cry
Real men don't cry




 Another day
Another spin of the Atlas
Another day
Another calendar page stacked up
Pull myself up off the mattress
Get changed
Then make a cup of the black staff
I've had enough practise
Practically captive
A lab rat running laps, hapless
Red eyed like rastas
I'm either very tired
Or something's happened disastrous
The redder the sclera
The bigger the terror
I regret
There's been a bit of clerical error
I've been subjected to medical tests
That have hyper-developed my genitals
Jealous?!
It's the genesis, fellas
Neuromods
To ride the punany
Here me now
Wish I had this earlier
It's criminal
I can have lived as long with a willy this minimal
Now I'm enhancing my chances
Of dancing with phantoms
That haven't had a man that's as handsome
Holding their sanctum
The mansion to ransom
While humming the national anthem
A panther run rampant
From aft to foredeck
Don't ask whats before Dec
It's "Ant and"
Put on a londoner accent
And you can rhyme it with pj and duncan
Danke schon
Gang star
Tailing prey
Transtar
Bailey jay
Moby dick on a mobius strip
No whaling this way
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away
Sail away...
Talos one
Floating in space
Ballast gone
No hope in this place
Phallus, dong
Stop Joking
It's taking any remaining pathos
Out of the song
What a shameful waste
I told them to make it
And they made it
Probably nothing to do with me
But never mind I'll take it
Never mind I'll take it
Never mind I...
Never mind, I'm Morgan Yu
Who you talking to?
Don't mind me
I'm just sorting through resources
To recycle a knife fork and spoon
And I might leave you covered all in gloo
With shimmering shine like a morning dew
You've been sleeping, haven't you?
Dormez vous
Dark harvest
Marvellous
I'm a bastard
My style is fatherless
Shout to Osiris, Joe bananas
Far from harmless when I go banans
Mad scientist, I'm not clothed in armor
Do it Bruno Mars style
No pyjamas
I'm that bloke in dramas
Fulfilling the trope:
Hero protagonist
Forcing rhymes in broken english
Like I'm twiddling the dial on a broken wireless
Psychotronic science is quite horrid
Take a typhon and a siphon the life from it
Now we're surprised that they want to fight for it?
It's an eye for an eye, and mines bollocksed
So now I'm a fightoholic
Ready to bounce like a lowrider's hydraulics




 The dystopia
Gets slowly worse
Over the years
We're going to burn
And I'm sorry for making you scared
But it's a sorry state of affairs
When man's a virus with shoes, a violent abuser
Of the planet he resides on and relies on it too
I want to do something to change it
But I'm afraid it's inside us, entwined in our nature
You and I should face it - the primary trait that
Unites the races is the way we use nature and rape it
I'm trying to find pride in my nation
But I'll die waiting for higher civilisation
Sorry for making you scared
But it's a sorry state of affairs when

The dystopia
Gets slowly worse
Over the years
We're going to burn
The dystopia
Gets slowly worse
Over the years
We're going to burn
And I'm sorry for making you scared
But it's a sorry state of affairs - listen
The class system of a past Britain
That still runs fast and thick through the innards of every last citizen
If you're from Pakistan, black-skinned, or just act different
You'll be asked questions and blacklisted
The fact is we're attached umbilically
To a fetid capitalist trap full of misery
But that isn't what gets me, the ignorant hegemony
But the fact that we're happy to live with it
The disaffected youth are in effect living proof
That respect is reduced to a reckless abuse
Of the ends where they grew through the stem to the roots
They will step on your shoes then expect you to move
Flipping heck, next thing they'll do's
Have you hanging in a hood, neck through a noose
So whether you accept or you're scared of the truth
Say your prayers cos we're due for a desolate future

The dystopia
Gets slowly worse
Over the years
We're going to burn
The dystopia
Gets slowly worse
Over the years
We're going to burn




 When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate

This morning somebody asked me for
My thoughts on porn in aural form
So I thought and thought
Until I was ethically caught in an awful storm
What does triple X stand for?
Is it having sex to get cash for your landlord?
If this is the case then what makes
Women who've done porn different than whores?
Is it a grand form of liberation
Helping women get away from the kitchen basin?
Being stripped from aprons has lit the way for them
To whip their tits out for the titillation
Of the internation, so whether you think it's great
Or a disgrace, jump into the debate
I ain't made my mind up if I'm honest
So I'd like to find out what you're writing in the comments

When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate

At the push of a button
You'll come across something to push your buttons
You could look at the butts of a Russian couple
That's rutting under the covers or something
It brings in billions in revenue
More than censorship could ever do
As well as huge fees Kleenex collects
Whenever their tissue is issued your residue
And yes it's true, that's an unethical view
To present on a semi-human petting zoo
But it's evident you, can never be a true
Economic liberal unless you let it be viewed
I regret to be rude, but, when you get in the nude
Who the heck else is it that says what you can do?
When someone puts their boobs on Yuvutu
Is it different to a student mooning on YouTube?

When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate

Porn creates an unrealistic expectation of females
So? My vids create an unrealistic expectation of emails
Do you think we should ban them or live with the fact
That fiction and fact are different matters?
How are you wagging the fingers you fap with
At that while you sit at the back of the cinema
Laughing at at Jennifer Aniston kissing a man
It's a bit of a hypocritical act
And people have equal rights
Not to be treated as pieces of meat for the pie
To receive the meagrest slice
With the notable exception of cream pie
There's umpteen types of erotica
So knocking the lot is illogical
That's what Mr Spock'd be calling
If all of the porn was put onto the bonfire
And the rest of the men'd be stressing out
Like Spock when it's Pon farr

When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate

Anyway, they only do it to pay the bills
But you could say that for any tradesman's skills
I'm sure a builder doesn't lay bricks
Just for the kicks
So what the fuck is the difference with sucking some dicks?
Oh, it must be the typically patriarchal
Chauvinist hegemonic culture of repression
Expressing contempt for those with different chromosomes than someone with a prick
I dunno, it doesn't quite stick
Cos if it's an amateur stripping for cameras
And still acting similarly amarous
Is it as scandalous?
If the answer is different, your opinion is ripped into tatters
You don't need to finger an abacus
To put two twos together, the digit's apparent, thus:
Zero, nada, zilch, nothing
Yet still people wanna be filmed fucking
Whether or not there's a lorry load of cheddar
The junk in the trunk wants to keep on trucking

When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate




 Hello, everybody
Today, we're going to be talking all about clothes

They say clothes maketh the man
And I'm rough around the edges, so I get them second hand
I'm a Dapper Dan, mon capitan
But I can hardly afford food, it might as well be Ramadan
Not an Islamic man, but I believe in charity
And that's the reason I need my meagre salary to feed me calories
I could eat a bag of sweets
Until my teeth have cavities and I'm in bleeding agony (aah!)
The reason for this allegory; cuisine-themed analogy
Is so you can see there's really not much cash left for vanity
My malady's a lack of Pounds and Ps
As an impoverished musician, food isn't guaranteed, apparently
So my apparel needs value
Unlike the brands' TV ads try and sell you
I don't wanna be a walking billboard
That's not what the reason that I walk this world's for

I'd go out tonight
But I simply can't decide what to wear
Yes, I'd go out tonight
But I simply can't decide what to wear
I've just got too many nice clothes...

Stuff from Oxfam? I've got lots, fam
Enough to fill up a rather large box
Pantaloons to top hats and shoes to socks
Dan's the dude to rock that used luminous jockstrap (eugh!)
Perusing the hotpants and choosing them off racks
I don't mean to be rude, but God damn, I'm hot, man (woo!)
I've got a bit of a tummy, so this is fitting funny
But I don't give a shit 'cause of how sick I'm spitting, dunny (brah)
See me, I'm a thrifty beatnik
I got this whole outfit for fifty three quid (hahah)
So if you need kit for a minimal fee
It's as simple as one (click), two (click), three (click)
Fork out a little bit of moolah for new garms (di-ding)
If anybody says it's not enough, they're chatting rhubard (ah)
Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah, Zip-a-Dee-Ay
You want a dead fellow's wardrobe? Bid on eBay

I'd go out tonight
But I simply can't decide what to wear
Yes, I'd go out tonight
But I simply can't decide what to wear

I'm low on cheddar and so I'm going second hand
'Til I compose a better plan for dressing, man (ah)
Wearing a garish tracksuit (yeah) with a pair of jackboots
Family staring, thinking "Dan, where... is that you?" (what?)
I put myself on eBay, but the winner didn't pay me though
I'm nearly at the stage that I'll be broke and made to sew
I'd make my own clothes, but I'm a lazybones, given my own way
I'd stay in my baby grow until I weigh like eighty stone (wehehegh)
So whether you like eighties clothes or ladies' coats
Get them second hand, they're fresher than the Daily Show
So get your daily dose of an amazing change of clothes
You'll be smooth and razor sharp like using shaving foam
I say stay away from those mainstream label trading posts
Once I saw a tie twice the price of a stately home
If you aren't on the gravy train, so can't pour the gravy boat
All over the pastry dough, you know the place to go

I'd go out tonight
But I simply can't decide what to wear
Yes, I'd go out tonight
But I simply can't decide what to wear




 Can't seem to find the words but I'll try
I can't seem to find the words but I'll try
The words never seem to come
Is it me?
Is it something that I've done?
Is it me?
Is it something that I've done?
Please let me know
Please, will you let me know?




 Hop in the titan
With the aim of stopping them striking
I'm not going to lie
It'll probably get properly violent
You should eat your greens
Because you're lacking in iron, man
I don't mean to talk beanstalks
But I'm jacking your giant
I've seen gore beyond belief
War machines torn up like magazines
Fragged to smithereens with C4
Rock you like a see-saw
Rucking's what I breath for
Drop you into free fall
And pop you when you respawn
Free running and free gunning
Among the debris, becoming elite
Keep running your mouth
I'll separate your gum and your teeth
I find it funny you keep
Coming back for more
Like Oliver Twist did
When he risked it
Cause he really wanted something to eat

Are you big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Reckon you're big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?

You're talking all that
While I'm ignoring, walking tall
While I'm taking great strides
You were barely taught to crawl
I'm a fighter personified
Warts and all
You've never fought a war
In all your life
Why, we all can brawl
You've not got the balls
To drop and fall
Hop from wall to wall
Adrenaline is setting in
A veritable smorgasboard
Of fluids running through you
Like a sewer or a waterfall
You're short of all the gall you need
And so you're sure to fall
Check my vortex blocker
It could more or less stop a chopper
While I take a break to make a mocha
Make a mockery of you
You can't refuse
I made an offer
Leave you shaking, quaking
Mate, you need to take your beta blockers

Are you big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Reckon you're big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?

Yeah, I think you're rather justified
In feeling mugged off
Every attack you tactically attacked with
Atlas shrugged off
So spray me with de-Ogre-ant
That stuff just rubs off
I stride up in my Stryder
And tear your lugs off
My smart pistol is ripping
And pulling apart gristle
Leave a dark ripple in your chest
You need kevlar nipples
I blast missiles at trolls
For laughs, giggles and lulz
So I wouldn't advise getting involved
If you're not MLG
MGL
A shower of empty shells
As everyone around me's
Shredded into bits
And sent to hell
No one's ever started something with me
That ever ended well
Whatever pilot or titan tried it
In the end they fell

Are you big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Reckon you're big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Are you big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Reckon you're big enough?
Come and have a go, I'll knock you off your feet




 Ah
Greetings, young soldier
Come, join me by the fire
And let me regale you with tales of what the fuck is cracking

We're in an ancient time
We face an ancient threat
Civilisation's never dreamt this kind of danger yet
Historians are self-assured
But they forget the daily tribulations
Of the cases from the place and age who met
Mythological creatures
With the oddest of features
At this moment there's no place
Fricking horrid as Greece is
Until I cross the seas to Egypt
And see that
When they say they've got a problem
They really mean it
For Prometheus
It seems that getting me's the easiest
Way they could alleviate the evil that is bleeding us
But I'm one of leagues of heroes
You best believe in us
It takes every drop of faith to battle evil thus
I tackled hell fire
To travel to Delphi
And fight what I find
From Jackalmen to Telkines
I leave at least ten beastmen deceased, dead
Each second
'Cause I reckon they don't really even need breath
I cleave heads like a watermelon
Before telling a merchant
Whatever he still hasn't bought, I'm selling
I've got to get the loot
The best produced
So I look fricking godlike
Whenever I'm next to you
From Greece to China
You'll never see a finer sort
I keep a pile of horns of Minotaurs
And Gorgon Queens' vaginal walls
Purely for the reason
That I could arrive at home
And write and then recite this vile rhyme for y'all
I never meant to babble on
But when I get to Babylon
I'm still only part way
On the hard path I travel on
You won't find a travelodge
Here in the wilderness
The plains are just as dangerous
As every building is
Filled with a selection of enemies to be killed
And it's down to you how you choose skills
That you will kill them with
Are you built like a brick shit house
Or is using spells more a soothing sound?
Ensure you're choosing well
I'm felling skeletons
As if I'm an elephant
Then a second later
I'm repelling them with elegance
They're in the closet
And I'm burying the evidence
I call the force of nature
Every one of the four elements
I've been through countless winters
Heat that'd burn hell to cinders
Just to lead me now
To the heaving mound at Mount Olympus
I climb and shout
Oi
Come out now and fight the best
Mortal to walk tall
The final bout of Titan Quest

Bards
Now you may just think these are the
Ramblings of a drunken old soldier
And you'd probably be right
But when the shit hits the fan
Whatever a fan is
Don't say I didn't warn you




 Her name's Lara Croft and this
Is the way that she started off
She hits land, stranded
In the wreck of the Endurance
She probably should have got better insurance
The challenges ahead are gonna test her performance
So endurance is of the utmost importance
Limited ordnance, she'll really have to use her wits
Now the developers appear to have reduced her tits
Dragon's Triangle, here's a house of lunatics
Darker than the night sky during a lunar eclipse
No clips to put into the gun, you know and
No gun, so it's a good job she brung her bow
Unarmed, not locked, loaded
Lara Croft going hard with a longbow, depart you with one blow
Prognosis: a disarmament pronto
Shots popping off as if there was a lock-in
In the bar with the Cointreau, top row combo
From the coast of the Arctic to the heart of the Congo
Lara's banging heads harder than Bongo's
And angering her enemies, like a mom joke

Tomb Raider's a tune that'll invade your brain
Get in her way and she'll make you taste the pain
(2x)

Shh. This is the bit of the track
In which I kill it with triplet raps
It doesn't particularly add to the narrative
But it's a blast
There isn't a faster Brit on the map
Who's spitting as wicked as that
So I suggest you give it a clap
Or I'll give you a slap
An aristocrat whose bars are hotter than ovens
Did I tell you the fact that Lara Croft is my cousin?
I'm dropping a dozen hip-hoppy productions a week
To leave you properly buzzing, and it's costing you nothing
I'm pretty sure than Nishimura should be hitting the record button
Soon as I walk up and talk upon Tomb Raider
Like a doomsdaying saber-toothed soothsayer
'Til then I'll see you dudes later
Touché, huh?

Tomb Raider's a tune that'll invade your brain
Get in her way and she'll make you taste the pain
(2x)

While Lara's raiding tombs
I'm sitting on my arse and making tunes
(2x)




 My favourite politician died today
And I've written these words in his honour

Rest in peace Tony Benn, one of the only men
To keep integrity through parliament, right to his lowly end
Held steadfast inside that phony den
So if you know a more honest MP, show me then
And I don't give a damn how you feel on socialism
When it comes to his integrity there's clearly no decision
Came from a privileged background just like our leaders did
Oxford PPE graduate, but kept it real and shit
So it's only fair that we should note
That between Tony Blair and Tony Benn
Benn was a loner in the cronies' lair
New Labour alienated him, made him marginalised
Pulled hard on the ties, wouldn't be part of the lies
Man, the way the political game has since changed
Cameron, Miliband and Clegg should look at him and feel ashamed
They'll keep their arse in line, just to toe the party line
Part of a mindstate that's hardly yours and hardly mine
When he became an MP 64 years ago
Who'd have thought he'd have over 60 more years to go
He was never ready to be a hereditary peer
Spearheaded a campaign to ditch the champagne for regular beer
He didn't want to be a lord, didn't want to be awarded
For things he never achieved, these should be ignored
What are we here for if not to assist
Our sisters and brothers cross the bridge across the distance from others
Blew through these damn walls like a human cannonball
His compassion was such that he refused to eat animals
Amnesty for striking miners unite in kindness
Fighting violence decry the loss of life in Palestine and Ireland
Writing diaries, spiking trident
If you like that kind of line up, grab a light and light your pipes up
He lost his title, but he kept on climbing
Lost government, but he kept on grinding
He lost the mines, but he kept on striking
He lost his seat, but he kept on riding
He lost his teeth, but he kept on biting
Lost mobility, but kept on writing
He lost his wife, but he kept on driving
Now he's lost his life but we will keep on fighting
Rest in peace, Tony Benn
Your legacy lives on

I do not share the general view that market forces are the basis of political liberty
Every time I see a person in a cardboard box in London, I say
"That person is a victim of market forces"
Every time I see a pensioner who can't manage:
A victim of market forces
The sick, who are waiting for medical treatment that they could accelerate by private insurance
They are the victims of market forces
If you can find money to kill people
You can find money to help people
Democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world
Far more revolutionary than socialist ideas, anybody else's idea
Because if you have power, you use it
When I was young, my dad said to me:
"The basis of political work is very simple
Always say what you mean, mean what you say
Do what you said you'd do if you have a chance
And don't "
And when I look back, I think that was good advice




 I'm basking in the sunlight, hi-hat sizzling
Snare cracking like it's blasting in a gun fight
The pattern of the drum's tight, kick pumping in your stomach
Something like the aftermath of a drunk night
Daft cunt, see I like music that has spunk
Thrash, pop, rap, punk, drazz-wop, jazz, funk
I'm beginning a vinyl collection
Thinking of buying all the decks and equipment then hitting the nightlife with a vengeance
But I've got a penchant for sitting in silence
Headphones hugging my noggin, I'm nodding my head to the said tones
I might be flesh and bones, but when I do a verse
My vibrations disperse through the universe
We can see the frequency, percieve them through the channels
I need a deeper feeling please, leave me with the ammo
White noise, clean my teeth, weaken the enamel
Street life's a squeeze like a needle to a camel
Please, I would leave in peace, retreating with the mammals
While leaves of trees are green at least, creeping in my camo
But a bee could see through these with ease, keys of a piano
Basked in light from black to white, from BC to Anno

Domini

There's no questioning Ben as an artist
My musical palette's not like yours
So the same brush I'll never be tarred with
I'm a sucker for a Hendrix guitar lick
But not a purist though, Kendrick Lamar's sick
Mate, head to the bar quick
And fetch me a large drink
I'm ready to get this cigar lit
Beer garden, start a party for the neighbours like
No sympathy, Marley and the Wailers, and Bacardi with a chaser
It's getting late so it's time to slip something a little harder in the shaker
Bit of Marvin on the playlist, then The Temptations
Followed by Smokey Robinson, we marvel at the greatness
I'm Syd Barrett on Interstellar Overdrive
I'm John Bonham in a hotel on a motorbike
I'm Ray Davies on a sunny afternoon
I'm Ian Curtis, I'm John Lennon, Bob Dylan and Keith Moon
Music helped me get through all I've been through
When just me, you, and the beat loop, how can I feel blue?
I've got videos and photographs if you need proof
I've lived, though I gave my plot away in the theme tune
Beit Nun up in your iPod docking station
Feel free to get up and leave if you're not relating
But if you are, take a seat, I'm down for the long awaited conversation
Two bonding strangers have when they're off their faces

Domini




 I'm in the dungeon under torchlight, hunting for some more fights
Lunging at these monsters with a hundred different sword types
Sorry chum, this one just isn't your night
I'm plundering your undergarments, but they feel all tight
I collect the sets of armour, check my rare pajamas
I slot the buttonhole with ember for some extra mana
My hotbar's rock hard, I'm rough like a dog bark
You're taking a beating, I've got heart
Drop bars like a bard practising a lost art
Rap battling a path to the boss part
On hard
To ensure I've done the job I employ a wondrous wand
You just can't get the staff these days
Go on, jog on
Waving my piece at dangerous beasts, aim and then squeeze
Flaming and making them bleed, draining their veins
Changing their brain to debris, savour the pain and release
When I slay 'em and the game says:
"Your fame has increased" (Abracadabra)
Open up a portal, get back to town
Trade resources at the stores and then head back down
Lay the smack down on an smorgasbord of organisms
If you've got an issue with it, soz, it isn't your decision
This is an important mission, and in your position
I'd put a cork in it, stop talking all this squawk and listen
Or I'll leave you in a poor condition, call a mortician
There's nothing more that we can do for you
The lore's been written
Feed my pet a couple of fishes, delicious
Please grant my wishes when I enchant my britches
When I'm battling with a Mycon, see a Tu'tara pick a fight
See a Ratlin get a fight on while I'm sparring with a Bittersprite
Look
I'm not the fickle type, never discriminated
If it exists, then it begs to be eliminated
Immolated
And if I spring a Mimic imitating anything
You better believe that I'll obliterate it
With a vicious uppercut, call it a facelift
If you faith, pray 'cause your fate's writ
Gadzooks, look in my hands, loot gathered up to transmute
The money that I earn gets burned like a damn Zoot
I'm overloading on potions and just hoping
I can go in on the next boss without overdosing
All this alchemy is probably not healthy, meaning
If I use it on my enemies it'll be helping me

Light the torches
And get down




 Yo, yo, yo
...yo-yo

I knew I was a fully grown man, a true bloke
The moment I moved over to LEGO from DUPLO
I was beautifully naive, a little Rousseau
I didn't follow instructions, to this day I rarely do so
It's true, bro, back then I never had a Cluedo
That I was musical, I didn't do sports, I was too slow
There was no sudoku, I did lots of crosswords
Wordsearches, Where's Wally and dot to dots
No aerial in the TV, so there wasn't a lot to watch
My parents played with me, in a way to please Doctor Spock
To my mom and my dad I'm honoured to have, I want to just thank you
With your support I'm rolling on top of the track like Thomas the Tank do

Man I love my toys
From action figures to puzzles, cards, stickers and games
Man I love my toys
If I hadn't played, my imagination wouldn't be the same

Before I could pour liquor, or buy cigarettes in a shop
I had football stickers in a nice little deck that I swapped
Collecting the Pogs and I had loads of Tazos
No notion it was only a passing fad though
Nothing could distract me from the task in hand
Racking all my little cars up into one massive traffic jam
I wasn't a massive fan of Action Man
That lacked the tactics Dan was after
Tasks with grand strategy and a battle plan
See the scene, a sea of green plastic army men
Amassed on a carpet desert, the three piece suite was sweeping scenery
No need to make a Tracy Island, I had one in the first place
And that was F.A.B
A fucking awesome birthday!

Man I love my toys
From action figures to puzzles, cards, stickers and games
Man I love my toys
If I hadn't played my imagination wouldn't be the same

I'm in a stupid mood, the rudest dude
My language is that colourful, I twist it like a Rubik's Cube
I made a bandana from my dad's tie, I think was purple
Can't recall the name of that specific Ninja Turtle
Me, I'm on that line of Brio kinda steelo
I roll it out then bring it sliding right back just like a Whee-lo
I write these raps to open up your mind like Mighty Max
Stacking rhymes like Jenga bricks until you hear a mighty crash
Flows crush you like the Stay Puft from Ghostbusters
As I transform a simple sentence into one of those punches
Some kids had a Happy Meal for most lunches
Let's just say they won't be in Olympic host countries

Man I love my toys
From action figures to puzzles, cards, stickers and games
Man I love my toys
If I hadn't played my imagination wouldn't be the same

I had a Golliwog, to which I was a bit hostile
The way I played could make behaviourists watchful
Maybe I'm racist, don't what I got so pissed off for
Regarding races, racing cars, I had a big boxful
I used to burn them over candles with Chris Cottrill
And once I got a LEGO cannonball stuck in my nostril
I love cyber pets of either sex, my Tamagotchi
Got treated, spoilt and overfed, he was hella podgy
Felt godly, I was the one to whom AI would look up
But I couldn't get my Furby to shut the fuck up
Kids, advertisers sell you shit they cook up
If you want a nostalgic trip, hit me up, I've got the hook up
I've got He-Man and She-Ra, I've got Trolls
They're called poseable action figurines, not dolls
It's a shame that toys are frowned upon for adults cause there's
Nothing much for us except the rubber stuff at Ann Summers

Man I love my toys
From action figures to puzzles, cards, stickers and games
Man I love my toys
If I hadn't played my imagination wouldn't be the same
Man I love my toys

I'm just playing!
Just toying with you
I was really jealous of my friend at... at first school, 'cause he had this
Beetlejuice toy
And it was... it was a coffin, or something
And you put... put a little model of Beetlejuice inside
Closed it and opened it and he was gone!
Missing!
Black magic
I wanted that shit so bad




 When I was a young boy, I wanted to be a film star
I wanted to star in my own action film called "Motorbike Man 12"
I don't know why specifically twelve, it just sounded cool!
But anyway, needless to say "Motorbike Man 12" never actually materialized
But instead, I have this

Check out my motorbike, I hope you like it
I'm a mix of a fighter pilot and a cyclist
Never mind physics, because I find it a little inapplicable
Right when I fly, limits never apply
And it's evident I'm not going to be the first daredevil to die
My hell is a temperate climate, So I'm revving on the engine
Just to get the frickin' temperature rising, never mind driving
I get my high riding, spinning my tires as I'm descending and climbin'
Livin' the high life, I'm literally high, pour me a Mai Tai
With a little lemon and lime in
All I need to eat is three square meals
And all I need to move is two round wheels
And when I nail a perfect landing I can't find the words
To describe 'dem feels', I lack an equal, a mix of man and eagle
Savagely ravaging people, Leave them wobbling like a weebel
I take a track and leave a battle scene
Gravity, hasn't been, something that particularly hassled me
People are chatting "See, well I imagine he's been to NASA's astronaut academy"
"Hasn't he?", You're lagging, keep up! All but forgotten
Stand like a man or you'll be falling on your bottom!
Rag doll rolling on the floor, you're performance is really rather poor
If you're struggling to keep up anymore
I'd really like for you to tell me what the hell you're here for!
I wield more balls than tournaments in snooker
A super duper loop-the-looper
The manner in which I'm shooting through the hoops
Is moving you into a stupor!
Face full of smoke like the user of a hookah
I'll leave you newbies trying to reach the new bit
Finding each solution and can finally be moving
From motorcycle riding to writing decent music
My old style's miles higher
It's Trials Evolution!

"Motorbike Man 12".. in very very very selective cinemas too. When I say selective
It doesn't even exist. I still want to do the film "Motorbike Man 12". Please
Hahaha




 Dan Bull's back in the saddle
(ohh, yeah, eeighh)
(vroom)

I'm sitting on the saddle of my motorcycle
Kicking up the gravel that'll poke your eyeball
Making roads though only sidewards
Go to the right 'til I pwn my rivals
My bike can fly, I'm rising skyward
You wouldn't like to try this but I would
Go higher, no wires
'Til my bones are broke like plywood
Two wheels and a health care policy
When I ride, there's a health scare, honestly
With the hospital costs that I've got
Every Third World debt could be dropped and forgot
Look, chum, between me and you (yeah?)
There must be an easier route (yeah!)
But if I took a bus for an easy commute (yeah?)
Then I wouldn't see the scenery too
My team is a beat (mwah)
Fifty nifty people who
Can easily do maneuvres
That need to be seen to believe to be true (woo!)
We'll leave it to you
To see a futuristic mystic misfit
Do the sickest fliptrick in the district (shit)
'Til I break stuff like the dude that's in Limp Bizkit (hah)
You're too simplistic to risk it
(Hah) You could sit and sift through statistics
And never see another human who's sadistic (brah)
Masochistic, through ballistics (bang)
Kick in the ignition 'til my boots are twisted (ah)
True persistence and brutal quickness
Rips through resistance of stupid nitwits
It's a twist of the wrist and the gears are shifted (vroom)
Give me a kiss, oops, I smeared your lipstick (whoops)
Clearly gifted, considerably
We're here to get lifted, literally
If you're in my vision even peripherally
I'll rip you to little pieces deliberately
Plenty more fish in the sea, I'm throwing nets out (splash)
Picking a team, only the best, wow
Collectively we're going to leave you stressed out
'Til evidently you gonna need a rest
Pow!
I apologise for my intrusion
But I want to fight with Isaac Newton (hugh)
When I ride my bike disproving his life's delusion
I'd confuse him
Sir, gravity is a trite illusion
That tries reducing my skyward movement
But my conclusion is I'm going to fly
It's Trials Fusion

I float through the air like a cloud
Shaped like a motorbike
And made from pieces of a motorbike
Indistinguishable in fact from an actual motorbike!
With me on it
Flying
Like a cloud
That's shaped like a motorbike (laughs)




 In the past they called me Harry
Tabloid bad boy
The rawkest lad of the royal family
But now I'm on my way to the war in Iraq
No more newspapers all on my back
Calling me a slacker
A right royal embarrassment
I am the son of the heir to all of Britannia
I wanna be there for all of the action
Backin' up my boys on the battlegrounds
And Dad'll be proud
Now his roudy youngest son's grown up
And knows how to hold a gun
I wasn't born as the oldest son
So of course I've become the disposable one
But I'll show you all
I'm cut from the same cloth
As every monarch that's ever fought, gained and lost
I've taken on the job of commanding
The greatest squad on the force and I'm on it
Honest to God, I cross my heart with my sword
And I promise, I wanna assure you all
It's not a task all my advice has made me do
The last royal that saw battle was 1982
I was over the moon when I found
I was chosen to take the troops deployed now
I'm going to make the Blues and royals proud
And if I break this oath, you can shoot me right down
You can put an arrow in my eye
Like the last herald when he died
But this time I'm on the winning side
With the scimitars we'll deliver in Iraq
To the limits of  we win at last
'Cause in the past the last time Britain didn't win a war
Was when we fought our current brothers in arms
I'm doing this for all the others in our country
But most of all for my mother




 Did you know that in the world
There are nearly half a million facts?
But the average person only knows about a quarter of them
So, like some sort of gay conversion therapist DJ
I'm going to try set the record straight

Ladies and gentledudes (Hi)
May you consent, approve and let me choose
A few selected truths
With which to lecture you and set to music
I was sent to do this by Skull and Pat
A couple of lovely chaps who produce some other nerdy rap
Fact: Michael Jackson wasn't actually black
He was Latvian and just happened to look like that
Fact: The planet isn't flat or round, it's a rugby ball
In feet and inches Peter Dinklage is bloody tall
Vikings never wore helmets with horns
They never even wore pants or trousers at all

Arranged by periodic maids and periodic butlers
Each chemical element is the size of a pelican
That's so tiny that it defies any measurement

Was a hundred and eleven, someone left it in a cupboard

Their biggest ever hit was Hotel Rwanda
A motown anthem about smoking ganja
Fact: A goat's antlers are made out of bone cancer
"Hello, ho" is the phrase you'd say when the phone answered
I'm so proud of everything I get right
There's no doubt 'cause I read it on a website
There are five directions: North, south, left, right (yeah)
And I'm only as good at rapping as the next guy (hah)

You need to move back (why?)
'Cause these are true facts
I've never found it too taxing to remove a screw cap (hah)
You need to move back (why?)
'Cause these are true facts
Catholic priests haven't been accused of doing lewd acts
You need to move back (why?)

Dr. Dre basically invented Boom Bap (?)
You need to move back (why?)
'Cause these are true facts (look)
Rest in peace to Big Narstie and 2Pac

Both killed in a hit and run, a different one
By the same bullet fired out of this specific gun
There isn't such a thing as an effective vaccination
You'll definitely go deaf from excessive masturbation (fact)
The human foreskin can be stretched enough to be a sleeping bag
Keeping tabs on eating habits guarantees a decent shag
This track's a live performance, but there's some streaming lag
Poland stole and revolved the pole that holds the Indonesian flag
Youtubers who do pranks are humorous and need thanks
The reason being there's huge demand for even deeper cheeky bants
It's ethical and legal, there's nothing they leave to chance
I'm not rapping this track while wearing geeky pants
Each grand piano has just a hundred keys
Eighty eight above and then another dozen underneath
It plays a special scale that only the deaf can tell
And the letters of the notes are engraved and etched in braille
Gucci and Chanel used to be free 'cause they wouldn't sell
People used to have to fetch their internet from a well
A wooden bucket full of someone else's e-mail
Encrypted hieroglyphically to hide the detail
Fact: The Egyptians were the first to use emojis (fact)
Filthy Frank plays a new character, this dude Joji (fact)
Each Disney movie's rooted in a true story (fact)

It's against the law to misinform, I assure you
The core use of a Tide pod's for food
Disagree? No need to call me, I'll call you (uh)

You need to move back (why?)
'Cause these are true facts
A screwdriver to the ear will remove the loose wax (chllp)
You need to move back (why?)
'Cause these are true facts
No hispanic person's ever take afternoon naps (hola)
You need to move back (why?)
'Cause these are true facts
A sort of faded shade of puce is the new black (oh)
You need to move back (why?)
'Cause these are true facts
Don't bother trying to improve, it doesn't do jack

And that's the truth (the truth)
You know it's the truth (the truth)
Because I spelled the word "truth" with a capital T




 There now follows a party political gangster rap
On behalf of the UK Independence Party

Hello
I'm Nigel Farage
Also known as Nigel Farage
Nigel Farage
So step back, Nicki Minaj
Cause I'm a wicked politician at large
With a vision of Britain
With no immigrant barges
Barging in
Causing arguments and argy-bargy
The Falklands is ours
We barred it from the Argies
Don't mess with the UK Independence Party
Cause we've a tendency to get nasty
Each time I gave a splendid speech
We gained momentum, speed
Faraging with a vengeance
We are in the ascendancy
A swing of the pendulum
And we will gain a bench of seats
Unrepentantly pro-Independence
See, my ideal ending scene
Is a never-ending referendum
On foreign bureaucrats
And where the heck we're going to send them
Next on the agenda?
Bloody hell, I can't remember
I'm too busy thinking
Of becoming an honourable member
I'm that friendly MEP
Aiming for an MBE
The Lib Dems and the BNP
They envy me
They know what I'm going to be
So they're poking fun at me
I've no fear
Bring your smears
Sling your mud at me
But bugger bringing in a single currency
What's the problem
With the monetary system we've got currently?
Great Britain is an excellent island
Significantly better than Ireland
I learned not
To be outnumbered by a bunch of Scots
Cause they've a tendency
To pile in and get violent
But I'm a man of great class
Make you look a straight ass
I carry on my campaign
Straight after a plane crash
Tell these champagne Socialists
I'm here to gatecrash
I'll Moët to your Babycham
And I can't wait to break glass
Rah
I dedicate this ungodly tune
To an MEP gone too soon
In memory of Godfrey Bloom

Rest in peace, Godfrey
What?
I know he's not actually dead
But it's better than saying he was forced to leave
For calling a group of women at the conference a bunch of sluts
Anyway, I digress
The point of the message that I'm trying to convey today
Is that voting for UKIP would be a splendid idea
The fighting bull strikes again
God save the Queen
Penelope Keith
Dennis the Menace
Roger the Dodger
Tintin
What?
Tintin's Belgian?
Why wasn't I informed of this?
Why did nobody tell that Tintin is Belgian?!
Get his literature out of my office now!




 YES!
Great…drumming…sample. I think it's time to move on to the next part of the song now, the --t-t-the…bring some bass -- bass it. Bass. Oooh. Oooh! Makin' me feel a bit wobbly! OK now, bring the filter up a little bit so we can hear some more of the piano sound…and I think that'll be great for a…a bit of rapping!
Uh!

Rappers I'm binning because I like to keep the streets clean
I'm really healthy cause my mommy made me eat greens
I'm like Popeye, nomming spinach and cursin'
The difference is when I'm finished my Olive Oil isn't virgin!
Hey, who on Earth's this British kid emergin'
From the murky depths of the web like a little critter lurkin'?
I've been observing from a distance -- I don't tread streets
But I'm controlling every block in all my spreadsheets
I'm your favorite rapper's favorite rapper's stalker
No need to hustle, I get paid vacations in Majorca
I'm an Ewok, the rap scene's a chicken walker!
I like my vindaloo, you've never had a chicken korma
Will an American even get that? I'm not hopeful
Indian cuisine options over there are woeful
Baltis are from Birmingham, I recommend you hop along --
If you're lucky, you might get some complimentary poppadoms
I couldn't even count the times that I've been offered one
I've been observing the game like a soccer mom
So I know who's deserving the fame and earning a name for burning the flame and who just blatantly is not the one
A lot of you are hating me because I dropped a bomb
To demonstrate the feeling of a blatant geek having just fucked your mom
I'll invade your scene full speed spitting and running, leaving you praying, screaming, "The British are coming!"
Rap's pickled onion -- bitter with a little honey, and
Spread it -- with that Philadelphia it's always sunny in
For every fan of yours I've got a awkward dork in a fedora that's willing to blow your bloody doors off!
I adore my fanbase, I'd give 'em all a handshake
But I'm quite keen on hygiene, and I've seen some hands, mate
That aren't in any damn state to even grab the handbrake
While rolling down a San Francisco route during a damn quake!
I've hit the front of DatPiff like a fricken' ram-raid
And taken advantage of my privilege as if it's gang rape
"Dan, mate, there's certain things you can and can't say!"
I'm tempted to become an MRA with all this man-hate
I'm scared to talk to women…it makes my hand shake!
I stay away inside my shell and then I miss the clam bake
I never flirt, cause flirtin' is the cousin of the sex
And I get nervous at the mention of it…God, I miss my ex

(York State of Mind)
(York State of Mind)

I dream that I'm a gangsta, mastermind, breaking out of Shawshank
Then I wake up and I'm just lying there in my Asda George pants
By the way, where I'm from, 'pants' means underwear
And I'll bet ya didn't know that, cause you don't come from there
And what's Asda? Come on, tell me what you think it is
No answer? Duh! It's Wal*Mart for the British-s!
Fuck grammar! Man, I'm the viciousestest British lyricist to rip literature to bits!
What country did your language come from? Isn't that telling?
Cause too many of you like British spelling
Can you believe that this is selling?
That I can rap anything I want, broccoli -- and people buy the track
I seem to have devised a knack to write the raps
That straddle the fine line either side of crap and tight as craps
I'll wreck the record like a vinyl scratch
Make your mind collapse like a building
Into which an airline flight has crashed
Oh. Have I just overstepped a line? I might just dash;
I think that the game that I'm downloading from online has patched
65 gigabytes, look at the size of that!
I'm going to need to delete some of my private stash
I spend my rap money on fibre-optic broadband
And LiveJasmin passes to catch up with your nan!
Now consequently I've got a very sore hand
So everybody, all together now: "Poor Dan!"
I'm taking rappers to a new plateau
And topping them in an extravagant fashion: gateau!
So you can reach for your biscuits, bitch please!
I'll reach for my biscuits -- Rich Teas
Come 'ere, gimme a hug, let's have a big squeeze!
I'm not letting go until I'm ready, you dick tease
I'm acting queer, and rappers react with fear
But I don't believe their distaste is that sincere
Pull off the hypermasculine mask and see
Another fragile human being who knows that feeling to collapse in tears
I've got throwaway lines enough to last for years
No limit, you already passed it like Master Piers

(York State of Mind)
Most rappers aren’t as good as me. That's not even a quote. That's a fact. I got it from Wikipedia
(York State of Mind)
Right. Right, I think we'll…we'll fade out for a bit, then move on to the next track




 Ladies and Gentlemen
Welcome to the start of the greatest album of all time
The Life of Pablo
(a one, a two, a one, two, three, four)

Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
Ultra, ultra, ultralight beam
Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
An ultralight beam ain't what it seems
And if you're not down in my team then you're leem
And by leem I mean lame but it didn't quite rame
It didn't quite rhyme, I'm in the right frame of mind
Eh




 An eagle soars as the streets all crawl
With people, stores and debris on the floor
We sweep up in awe at the cathedral walls
This city's laws are in need of rehaul
Freedom calls
Soldiers amassing and stacking their ammunition deep in the courts
Stand in a rank v. tattered banners and flags enacting a massacre
The assassins see this and leap from the walls unsure what the August Decrees did at all
Are you sure the Bastille couldn't fall?
We should rally morale and proceed with the war
Locks are chopped
The drawbridge drops
The raucus flock 'til they're reaching the courts ignoring the shots meat for the slaughter bleed on the floor just reeking of gore
Thanks a lot to the sans-culottes for yanking off the breeches they wore
Breaching the walls and windows leap to the floor and the smokescreen it before defeating the bourgeoisie with a claw
I'm sure we've seen this before
Better catch and dispatch him or that matchstick'll blast this bastion to ashes
That sort of action's a burning mistake
Chat to my back cause I'm turning away
The earliest grave is the turn of your fate courtesy of the dear Third Estate

The blade of the guillotine drops
I look at my watch then put it in my pocket and hurry, I've got to run in and stop my unlucky target succumbing to harm and crumbling under the chopping block while onlookers watch in numbness and shock
Back to the backstreets and the cobble
No palace these chaps dream of a hovel
Run around the action
Gunpowder blasting
Push past the crowds and leap up a shop wall
Two hops and I'm on the rooftop
Move to a new spot and then I'll soon drop
Assess the scene eagle-eyed who needs to bleed who needs to die you need to read between the lines and move the bleating sheep aside
This is the reason why
I made the decision to leave Versailles
Grim Reaper, unsheathe my scythe then cleave and leave deprived of the need to breathe or even be alive, at least
You see, I need to find Elise cause she gives me a reason to be a lease on life as we unite

Oi gisborne
You're in the midst of a big storm
The rich fawn while the poor can't keep the their kids warm
So you can attack me, hack me and block me
But you'll never stop me from following loxley
Just watch me
I'm one in a million merry men and women in your citizenship
Who are seriously sick of it
So we declare your leadership
To be a little bit illegitimate
It's chilling isn't it?
Your men we give them stick
Like it's a piece of cake
Fight for everything at stake
Uniting the three estates
Ay, the smallest of viruses
Can cause the fall of the taullest of tyrants quick
We're
Using the volumes to contradict their intended purpose
Rising up from the underground 'til we enter th surface
We are not asking for a world thatss incredibly perfect
We just want to live in a state that's fair enough to be worth it
For an amateur that's brandashing a camera
Well he's a heavy hammerer
That'll dash up and damage you
Loxley's a kid with big bloody balls
He'll rob from the rich and give to the poor
This is a war (it's a war)
This is a war (it's a war)

 Who developed the vuvuzela, what a stupid fella
I'm sure musically that you and me could do it better
By amassing the the larynxes of a thousand
Japanese pornstars and attaching that to an extractor fan
I know that's a clumsy example but damn
It's absurd trying to put in words a clamor this bad
I don't intend to offend the south african fans
But I'd be more than happy for this crappy toy to be banned
It's gotta be one of the most annoying of fads
I wonder what'll be the next annoying noise from the stands
Can we expect a cat strangling boy band
Or perhaps a pack of orangutans enjoying a shag
They say it's atmosphere but it doesn't sound like that to me
It's like a massive accident happened in a brass instrument factory
Actually, look if I had to be honest
I'd probly prefer somone to stamp on my bollocks
Than listen to this infinite din, I'm finding it hard to stay calm
I think I'd rather listen to a rape alarm and amputate an arm
I'd even maybe go as far as to say that I would rather
Be serenaded by John Barnes

Maybe
Up yours, Vuvuzela
Or uh Voovoozeyla, Vuvoozela
Voovusela, Vuvoozela
Voovoozela, Vuvuzeela
Vuvuzella
I don't mean to be culturally intolerant
I've got just a headache




 (Wall Street Spirit)

From all of us who couldn't be there in person
We're there in spirit through the words in this verse. Listen:
New York cops are arresting the wrong people
Peaceful protesters are not evil
But the love for money is
The bloody buggers pulled the rug from under yours
These days the actual news is
Just as funny as stuff from The Onion
The bulletins are full of things
That are full of more bull than my surname could have been
You could put 'em in a jail cell 'til they're bailed out (hah)
Bailed out
But you're only gonna fail now
Because we're staying around 'til we prevail
The crowd's not going away
They're standing their ground
'Til an answer is found
This is for everyone that's been busted
I don't wanna rhyme "banker" with "wanker"
But I just did

All streets lead to Wall Street
So we all need to make them feel the force and heat
All streets lead to Wall Street
So we all need to make them feel the force and heat

Is it reckless speculation
To suggest that reckless speculation
Went and made a mess of this situation
Taking everything except for the kitchen basin
Then when you're sitting on the pavement to make this statement
The feds kick your face in
It's flagrant, it's blatant
It's amazing the way they shamelessly raped us
Statesmen are too craven
To take us away from the days of Reagan
And raise regulation to a state
Where the stakes are less dangerous
But now the alarm clock's ringing
The nation awakens and can't stop singing
Now the alarm clock's ringing
The nation awakens and can't stop singing

All streets lead to Wall Street
So we all need to make them feel the force and heat
All streets lead to Wall Street
So we all need to make them feel the force and heat

And thanks to Lupe Fiasco for the tents
Cheers, matey




 I'm smacking a man with a baton in hand
That is the plan
Blasting a gat at a gang
(Quick) Bang (Bang bang)
No matter how fast they ran
I'm packing the baddest of backup plans
Attackers, I hack them and transfer the data then
Crack with the elbow the prat has just fell over
Blast 'til the last man stands
Click
The flick of a switch
The sprinkler spits
An image of somebody nibbling fish using a chick as a dish
This is ridiculous shit
(Haah) Call it tomfoolery
Who's the girl? The one with the jewellery
I'm sneaking up on any fool that be
Foolish enough to believe he's as cool as me
Popping a shot in his noggin and holding a hostage
Who folded and told so I hold off from offing him dead
One shot in the leg and walk off as he begs
Now the coppers have entered the scene
I've left them and fled as I head to the street
Thinking they got me but I'm not backing down
Stop the clock and the city is blacking out
Lagging out
I'll grab you now
You panic as I ram a police man into the ground
And now they've gone and found the human trafficker
The Superman with the computer
Is after you pursuing and hacking you

Wherever you go I own every zone
Heavily loaded with loads of the cleverest pro kit
Wrecking the road with my tech as my phone
#9litcHes# *Glitches*
A second of code into the system
And I'm dressed up as a regular Joe
In regular clothes
And nobody could ever expose it
Oh sh*t
I'm ready to just rev and then go
Begin
Ever so slow then wait to accelerate whenever the moment is..
(Go) wait...
Wait...
Wait...
I'm ready I'm going in

Picking up a ticket for the method of my driving?
Nah, I'm skiving
I am wickeder than wicked
And I take it into hiding
Quicker than a whippet (Where?)
In west riding
Whipping out the whip
It's hide and seek
Quick, let's whip inside and see
If I can divine a unique
Design that'll silently peek
Behind every blind
So I can provide
Any enemy with a violent surprise
Survey the scene it's Aiden Pearce
Don't care who your agency is
You're facing the meanest surveillance genius
Leave an imprint of your face in the street
Just DDoSing
CtOS
And tossing them in the sea
Cause I'm an MC
Constantly watching and seeking
So watch what you're speaking
Stopping a chopper from dropping a spot
In the spot that I be in
Got to be leaving
Pealing off on my feet like socks on a hot day
Leaping off of the bar
Ah
Good evening, officer I just need to see the bars
I've got on my phone and leave you lot in the dark
Now the city's power is ours
And I'm devouring it stopping the heart
I'm on a boat
It's obvious I'm a boss hog
Watch Dog
Watching the watchers I've got to log off

 This is a tribute Aaron Swartz, I'm just showing my respect
So let's have a short moment to reflect

Was it cybercrime or fighting for rights ?
I admit it's a fine line so might I present this:
A track record you might find distinguished
The highlights of which are quite trying to list
This bright mind extinguished died trying
To bring this Brave New World To life
CYBER-GENESIS
Computer-literate, like-mind linguist;
The lines in his script are my kind of English
And hindsight provides quite the image of an activist
Hacktivist dying like he lived in the firing line
Of online rights traditionalists, politicists
Quick to stick his digits on the hit list
A lifetime in prison can drive minds to sickness
So why am I surprised he did this ?
Fighting insurmountable odds handed down from the gods
Because David is a risk when Goliath runs a business

We're all Aaron Swartz in a manner of speaking
We'll carry on his work that still needs completing
We're all Aaron Swartz in a manner of speaking
We'll finish every mission that still needs completing...




 Let me tell the story of Ezio Auditore
Adolescent, Rowdy, Brawny
Exceptionally hella horny
He's the sort of lout that's surely doubtless purely out for glory
But something out of the ordinary happened to make his tale more gory
When a man's family is taken away
Anguish and hatred can make him change his aims
In the space of a day
He went from causing heartbreak to causing heartbreak
Literally, Requiescat in Pace

We are Assassins
We work in the dark to serve the light
We are Assassins
Facilitate the fate of those who deserve to die
We are Assassins
Committed to the Creed to which we have submitted
Nothing is true
Everything is permitted

See your death throes
When I broke your brains like an egg yolk
And throw them on the wall
Like I'm painting a Fresco
Techno Retro
So let's go get those Codex Notes
Is the next bloke better than me
Yep, Nope
He's lacking intelligence
While I'm actively elegant
Rapidly getting even more Machiavellian
Even though my armour's a thin sheet like pyjamas
It'd simply need an army to lynch me
With half an inch each of yarn
I would nimbly fight my way out of the bondage
It's kinky
And since he's the father of ingenuity
Leonardo Da Vinci's partly responsible
For the hard to believe half of your eulogy
So let me take this opportunity
To fluently and lucidly
Produce a piece of music
For the Creed to keep in Unity
Now please do excuse me
I need some promiscuity
It's been too long for me
It's been like 2 mins since I've seen some nudity
 x2
We are Assassins
We work in the dark to serve the light
We are Assassins
Facilitate the fate of those who deserve to die
We are Assassins
Committed to the Creed to which we have submitted
Nothing is true
Everything is permitted

Pimping out the Villa
Til it's as big as a Basilica
Villagers bringing in bigger income
In unlimited integers
Injurious extrajudicial inquisitor
Instant criminal conviction distributor
There isn't a bit of room in this system for prisoners
I whip out the scimitar
And administer a sinister signature finisher
So you're dead in the middle of the original Italy
From city to city
I'm an invisible visitor
My mission is to sit and listen
As the conspiracy thickens
I'm within your perimeter
But without parameters
My rapping is advanced a bit
Past Iambic Pentameter
Fricking amateurs
There's an assassin in the Vatican
Attacking from the battlements
A man with an axe in his back?
It has to be an accident
A bloody baptism
Standing in for the sacrament
That randomly occurs
Until it's happened to the last of them

We are Assassins
We work in the dark to serve the light
We are Assassins
Facilitate the fate of those who deserve to die
We are Assassins
Committed to the Creed to which we have submitted
Nothing is true
Everything is permitted
We are Assassin's 




 You're looking at the biggest beast in Warcraft
Armour way stronger than the steel that your sword has
Sharper than the claws of every demon you've encountered
And I'm known for burning legions, since no one matches my power
Blood spills, I get the taste for fun
Pop flyer than a Harpy you'll be leaving as a faceless one
Will I rule this world no doubt one day
Cos I'm way sicker than the Corrupted Blood Plague
Planetary burner, igniting all your servers
The bull's running with me, your only options to serve us
The moment players heard us, they've bowed at the auras
Without the need of combat, and honestly it bores us
Cos no one comes close to a smidgen of my strength
No race no faction, no ones shortening the length
Of time I'll be sitting on my throne, try? I'll split you
You'll be swimming with the fishes, floating with the Jinyu's
You're nothing but a gnome, what's a Dwarf to a Dragon?
Nothing but an insect, a fly I'll get to smackin'
Standing twice as tall as a Magantaur, savage boss
The biggest threat to ever be spawned in Azeroth
The more that I reign, the more I get colder
Executing everything from Imps to Ogres
Voidwalkers, Trolls, every part of the Forsaken
Every treasure in the world is mine for the taking
Every human in the game and those at their computer screen
Better take note that tyranny ain't new to me
A demigod but I'm far from Cenarius
The Dryads took note of that, and so they stay far from us
My only alliance is with Dan, get in line
For the slaughter that we're bringing forth, it worsens as time
Goes by, so say your goodbyes, no matter the amount
Cos after this moment, you're losing you account

Welcome to the World of Warcraft (x4)

Thank you, Shizzy
Holla!
I'm the Asher Roth of Azeroth
Watch a man with Valor mock you
To abyssal depths amid the hellfire I ran amok
I live on got it on lock mode
Dan's hit a crossroads
I take a dollar and change it to a million
I've got loads
I go hard
I'm not just rock hard, I'm stone hard
Flow hard
Oh no, there are more blowhards
I'm a bard that's assured to make you laugh
Ask Mike Tyson what type of fuel you put in a car?
"Gath"
While other stars rest in Beverly Hills
Brad Pitt's polar opposite sites developing skills
You're acting silly, thus I spit with venom, spite
And more vocal gadgets than Iron Man while you're a Mennonite
Eminem consults me for advice
I'm Marshall's refuge
Point in case: I told him if he'd get rude
He'd get huge
I said a clever song would sell when beats are banging
Man, I love giant sub basslines and a grand piano
And I sure watch a lot of twerk clips on YouTube today
I love thunder-clapping buns
Show me that booty bay!
But when the storm peaks don't let the thunder mar
The wrinkles of grimmer things
Swinging in your bra's underwire
With all those ratchet hoes acting gross
Don't they actually know
About Venereal Disease?
They could be catching loads
I roll with practice
The fact is it makes a tighter joint
I don't vote for UKIP but I see Nijel's point
Listen chum, I come from brum, a panned area
But It's brill, and is where Tolkien lived, man, where are you?
So take your gangsta clichés and all that junk back
I don't own a single gun to necessitate a gun rack
But after my hammer falls
You'll feel the sword of vengeance
Landing on you like a thousand needles
String you up and left you hanging by a thread
See the blood, watch it trickle down
Amidst the mist, I've buried more bears than a fricking triple town
My rhymes are dark, sure
Well out of the suns reach
To the point where the dusk would be some relief
I'll do a thirty two bar verse on thumping beats
But some of you don't ever look and see the puns beneath
I've never let a failed conquest hold me under see
My domination points to genius with every tumbling leaf
Rap's lumberjack, I fell wood but when I splinter tree
Post traumatic stress flows into me
Cold and fresh as a winter spring
What can I do for a song?
I'm sure by now you've got an inkling
I've got to win, to hold the honor, grasp it tight
I grow old and see the west fall before I waive control of the mic

Welcome to the World of Warcraft (x2)




 When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they ignore, and it's painful to see (such a shame to see)
You're a wannabe (baby)
Nobody wants you (nobody wants you)
Danny Boy, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

Slim Shady's been making
The same gimmicky single ever since his debut
And Doctor Dre? God you've aged
Have you not been replaced yet? Watch this space
It's Dan Bull and I'm on the case
Heckling the a-list like the gossip pages
And now Lady Sov's washed her face
And looks vaguely posh, she's maybe hot to date
I should maybe stop taking pops
In case the cops come and raid my place unwarranted;
I mean they came in Damien Green's office
Having not asked Jacquie Smith
What would she say if Ian Tomlinson asked if
The police state actually exists?
It's okay cos she's Happy with a Saturday in
A pack of tissues and some tacky vids

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they ignore, and it's painful to see (such a shame to see)
You're a wannabe (baby)
Nobody wants you (nobody wants you)
Danny Boy, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

You'll need the hospital
When you read the cost that the arena wants off you
To see the paed... er, king of pop
Can we believe that Johnson'll be responsible
When he's previously offered to beat up on someone?
Once up on a time, we were sensible;
Would choose an MP whose policies were credible
But the time Brown went to the White House
His friend Mister President sent him on time out
Man I'd love to hire out Alan Sugar right now
Just so I could tell him "Look, you're fired, out!"
I would pass the buck to Captain Crunch
But I've had enough financial advice now
Hasn't The Sun enough to lie about
Without another patronising accountant flying round?
'Cause our darling Alistair cried out
Times ahead are as dark as the black of his eyebrows

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they ignore, and it's painful to see (such a shame to see)
You're a wannabe (baby)
Nobody wants you (nobody wants you)
Danny Boy, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

This is a promotional track for my album
And it isn't relevant but you should check it out
And if you want you can give me money too
Come on and help to give the world economy a boost
Has no-one ever told Cheryl Cole she could never hold a note
Let alone tell whether someone else is better?
Oh yeah - by the way, Simon's waistline
Is way higher than Jade's final age
I shouldn't have made that statement
Because if the papers are to be believed she's an angel
Forget the race issues, they were yesterday's news
And today sales are huge
Madonna's a media concoction too:
If she's Jesus' mom, why the need for adoption?
Madge, aren't you getting on a bit? You're like fifty
No wonder you got ditched by Guy Ritchie
Nah, you're alright, still - oh, Hi Lily
How's your guy, is there still life in his willy?
I feel silly, 'cause I like you all really
Sorry everyone, I want a bit of nice publicity

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they ignore, and it's painful to see (such a shame to see)
You're a wannabe (baby)
Nobody wants you (nobody wants you)
Danny Boy, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

Mate you should download my debut album now

 My full name's Cheltenham D.G.L.B. Digby
My diet consists strictly of single malt whisky
I'm particularly sesquipedalian
I've not published a single literary failure
And I'd speculate that's mainly thanks to the fact
That I don't even write books, I just rap
Trust that I'm a distinguished linguist
Whose voice's weapon of choice is English
A rhythm wrecking rhetorician, getting recognition
For the fact that I'm swagger's dictionary definition
On first look, you're ready for a second listen
I took your sister to third base, cherry picking
Heavy hitting, yet with incredible erudition
It's a travesty you haven't seen me rapping on your television

I'm Cheltenham "Douglby" Digby
My witty words make your willy feel all wiggly
I'm Cheltenham "Douglby" Digby
If folk don't dig me, they don't know diddly

Allow the grime scene for the time being
I turn the G into a C: crime scene
I'm the nightmare to come and wreck your nice dream
I'll open up your top like a double decker sightseeing
I ripped the Rolex off of Wiley
And now I wear it in my jacket pocket by my tie, see?
I'm the reason that your wife's seen the dry cleaner
Imbibing my seed like Ribena
I'll livestream it widescreen
As she lies, semen smeared on her cheeks like a child eating ice cream
She might need a new dress; Lewinsky
I'm going mental on your crew's set; Klaus Kinski
I'll kick your mumsy in the mimsy with an air of whimsy
Then throw her down the stairs like a slinky

I'm Cheltenham "Douglby" Digby
My witty words make your willy feel all wiggly
I'm Cheltenham "Douglby" Digby
If folk don't dig me, they don't know diddly

Give me a mo, bro; Digby
Will make your ho go giggly, oh so quickly
The po-po tried to photofit me
I simply did this and they let me go: victory
I don't have any history, lathered in mystery
Someone phone Agatha Christie
My breath smells of a packet of Wrigley's
Mixed with whatever the hell my tobacconist gives me
I'll piggyback on the back of a pygmy
Screaming "quickly, quickly" while I'm jabbing his kidneys
From the Indies to Sydney and in between
A Cold War submarine is my limousine
A libertine with the sympathy of Mr Bean
A prick that means to to be inflammatory so bring your antihistamines
I'm Mister Meanness, I bring a list of misdemeanours
Bigger than your sister's penis; how pissed the scene is
Just switch your speakers off if you're squeamish
I've completed treatises and theses on faeces
I'm the bee's knees; pollenating on the daily
I leave seeds upon a range of lovely ladies
I ram raided Hades with a Mercedes
Camera in the deceased's faces: "say cheese"
I'm from a place of make believe, and now I'm real
Slightly hallucinatory is how I feel
Thou art kneeling before me; raw meat
Ready to be churned and then turned into corned beef
Balls deep in the rhythm like a porn scene
And jisming, it's beginning to get a bit like Wall Street
With all the greed I'm growing taller than a broad bean
Drag you to the park folded in half like a lawn seat

I'm Cheltenham "Douglby" Digby
My witty words make your willy feel all wiggly
I'm Cheltenham "Douglby" Digby
If folk don't dig me, they don't know diddly




 It's been said that the first casualty of war is truth
And I'm inclined to agree
Listen:

We live in an age of instant information
So isn't it strange that things have been hidden away from us
Governments think we need to gain their trust
But it's the other way around, just take a look
Nothing tells us more than raw data does
So it's important it's all available to us
Plus put up for debate
And looked at by the public's gaze
Because there's a lot more to be gained from taking off the ball and the chain
And the blinkers that have been causing us pain in more than one way
Power to the people? We've fallen away from it
There's a formal name for this, it's called a dictatorship
And censorship's not restoring our faith for shit
So let's rip away the red tape and paperclips
It's a shame that it's come to this for freedom of speech
That we need a safe haven for people that leak
But you see, we speak what we seek
And we just seek what we speak, and that's the truth that's keeping us free

The truth will set you free
The truth will set you free

The issue's prickly when it comes to WikiLeaks
Different people see it differently and disagree
Does it pillory the bigotry of ministries of tyranny
Or is it merely hindering the coalition's victory?
It's a mystery to me, but look at history
You'll see that liberty is eager to face up to inquiry
We learnt a heap from Bradley Manning, didn't we?
We saw conspiracy hidden beneath the sheet of anonymity
This military intelligence is giving me the evidence
We really need to step up and declare that we're fed up of it
Why should we trust you when everything that does come through
Shows we shouldn't trust you as far as we could chuck you
Try to silence something, it'll become amplified
Magnified by wires, waves and satellite
We won't be pacified by the fact it's classified
You need a mandate from the people to be ratified
So on their behalf I shall provide this battle cry
To tell the powers that be that we're clearly unsatisfied
And if you ignore my reasonable plea
That's just fine by me, 'cause all the media's seen
The cause and reason for leaks is more than freedom of speech
It's also people's belief that we all need to be briefed
In order to keep all the peace, we ought to police the police
And that takes much more than just the formal PR release
So all in all you see, we speak what we seek
And we just seek what we speak, it's the truth that's keeping us free

The truth will set you free
The truth will set you free

Should we listen to the whistleblowers? Of course
Even if it'll throw us off course?
Of course, 'cause if you need to suppress the truth
Then I expect that you've got some regretful news
But it's best that you confess and soon
Before we end up less than destitute
Civilian deaths and executions are routine
While billions are spent on weapon producing
Do you think you can reduce the terror threat
By inflicting terror on an infant that's never witnessed terror yet
Look, if Americans had taken my parents away
I'd never forget my vendetta 'til I'd settled the debt
It'd take more than an open letter to let you know
That what we see's obviously not democracy, it's puppetry
This jungle's burning and we can't see the wood for trees
Sky's keeping us dry, so we need someone to leak
Because you see, we speak what we seek
And we just seek what we speak, it's the truth that's keeping us free

The truth will set you free
The truth will set you free
The truth will set you free
The truth will set you free

Thanks to WikiLeaks - one of the most important websites ever
And thanks to everyone who's put their personal safety on the line
In order to expose something that they feel needs to be known
The truth will set you free

Don't you know you’ve seen a ghost
Cause were supposed to be nobody
No relief
Under cover canopies we go beneath
Okeley dokeley
Shipping coca leaf overseas
Isn’t supposed to be so easy
So were blowing the boat into pieces
Jesus
A landslides just enough pebbles
To ruffle feathers
I stand by as the dust settles
A gunmetal nettle in a meadow full of buttercups
A shark fin cutting through a slew of rubber ducks
Pull up in a grubby truck
Covered in mud and muck
The stuff is shut up in a wooden hut
Motherfuck it up
A sudden rush of blood
A warm buzz, a blush
Rubbing a sore bloody raw with a scrubbing brush
Hush
Even if we must stand here for hours
A rush and a push
And the land that we stand on is ours
The Santa Blanca gangs a contraband extravaganza
We deliver packets to the planet like a phantom Santa
Stuffing our pockets with narcotics
You can’t stop it
Far from it
The harder you try, the larger is our profit
Our wallets are swollen up from the hard product
Bars solid
This is real crack music
Harmonic

We are Passengers
We are Drivers
We are Travelers
We are Survivors
We are Hunters
We are Judges
Administer Justice Swift
Without grudges

Freezing or blazing all seems to be the same up in here
We're all-terrain warriors razing reigns in Bolivia
Heartfelt alarm bells ring heavier than bar bells
Money m-m-multiplying like a fertilized cell
Cartel giving a hard sell to clientele
No "voulez-vous de la cocaine
S'il vous plait, madamoiselle?"
This is life or death, we do not require a locked cell
No one else is qualified, we're dealing with it ourselves
Dark realms, doubts
You can't help the cards dealt
But if you've a large mouth
You’re in the dog house
I've witnessed horrors upon the likes of which I shan't dwell
But hang around and you might well find out
The Wildlands is no climate for a mild man
But my old man said I should climb up as high as I can
You better be nice
Every time
When we're behind
Enemy lines
‘Cause otherwise
It'll be like
The time when Kennedy died
Sniping time
Deadly as cyanide
Your head in the firing line
Violent, dynamite your mind
You're dead as a trilobite
And by the by
I'm flying by to foil your vile plans
So try your hand, I am the trial of the Wildlands

 Sleep through nuclear winter
And rest
Heal, reinforce, hold on
And rise
Welcome to your kingdom
Your paradi**
Welcome to your kingdom
Your paradi**
Bye bye bye
In heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine
You got your good things
And you got mine
In heaven everything is fine




 My wisdom teeth are causing me trouble
Forming a huddle in the back of my mouth
And now to talk is a struggle
So I trade the punchlines for more of a subtle approach
And just hope you decode more than all of the puzzle
'Cause of course I've gone pop, I wasn't born in a bubble
Fuck my kingdom for a horse, I'd give my horse for a cuddle
And I'm bored of all the posturing a lot of hip hoppers bring
Sincerity's like love: it doesn't cost a thing
So always check the pocket of your jeans
Before you set the rinse on the washing machine
Buy a stack of birthday cards and presents
So you can use them in the event that you forget them
Then throw away fifty things you haven't used lately
Ideally you'd only keep what you use daily
Make the phone call that you've been putting off for months
It's a load off your mind and you'll be done in time for lunch

Pull out my wisdom teeth
To give to each of you
Who never will admit defeat
And I think I'll be A-OK
If I live to see the day
My wisdom teeth decay
Pull out my wisdom teeth
To give to each of you
Who never will admit defeat
And I think I'll be A-OK
Yeah, I'll be A-OK

I see and hear quotes everywhere
Proverbs and advice from experts, sages and inspirational figures
But it's not particularly useful in comparison to the wisdom I've acquired
Simply through living my day to day, mundane life
And with these abilities, I'm on a Steve Miller steez
We hear so much deep advice
Philosophical insight on the way we should lead our lives
But you don't really need to be Jesus Christ
Just read between the lines and then you'll be just fine
You don't need a preacher to teach or guide
You through the maze, each day leads you deep inside
So keep an eye out, see the lighthouse
Watch for the rocks and just reach for high ground
Patiently wait for the breeze to die down
Now I believe that we need a lie down
So I relax in the dentist's massive chair
Puffing on a heady mix of gas and air
The psychedelicism's elegance is evident
As black satin patterns pass and past passions flare
Yeah, and now there's plasma everywhere

Pull out my wisdom teeth
To give to each of you
Who never will admit defeat
And I think I'll be A-OK
If I live to see the day
My wisdom teeth decay
Pull out my wisdom teeth
To give to each of you
Who never will admit defeat
And I think I'll be A-OK
Yeah, I'll be A-OK

I never had such fun in my entire life
I'm feeling like Tenguy right now
Shoutout to Tenguy
He's out there
Somewhere
I hope
Shoutout to you too




 Have you ever been so hung over
That you don't know whether you just woke from a coma?
But you're teetotal
You're totally sober
So it's gotta be your body's bones that are broken
A global explosion
A tyrannical virus
Nearly as bad as writing in comic sans
And papyrus
Luckily there's something that we can prescribe
It's a man that'll fight
To dismantle the Reich
Blond haired, blue eyed
But he doesn't subscribe
To the doctrine that it makes him higher than another guy
He doesn't like taking credit without merit
He's ready to demonstrate it
To anyone that doesn't get it
He brought a big bag of bloody guns to the party
'Cause what's the point in just punching a nazi?
Never mind a sucker punch
Off someone you can't see
I'll bring a tank to the demolition derby
Leaving nothing but a bit of charred meat
In the car seat
Can't be doing with that parlay malarkey
Says "shoot first, ask questions never"
"to anyone claiming to be the best, I'm better"
Meet BJ Blazkowicz
A one man natural disaster risk
He's hurting to hurt
And he'll scratch that itch
By tracking down a nazi
To blast to bits
No small prints, caveats or asterisks
Won't bow to the master
That cracks the whip
He'll be standing on the back
Of the basilisk
And hacking at its scalp
With a bloody battered fist
Takes pain like a masochist
But he'll never self inflict
Never slash his wrist
The only manner in which he'll ever go down's
Whenever he throws down
With the last nazi bitch

The best you got?
Your best won't do
Now you are the weak
And this is your doom
You are among wolves now
And these
Are our woods, our howls, and our feast
There when the smoke clears
And the flames
And all's laid to waste
One man remains
Frau, can you feel it, can you see?
No army left
It's just you and me

Imagine being accused of as subhuman
Because you are another hue
From the dude who is ruling
Imagine overnight losing all you loved ones
No goodbyes, no hugs they're just gone
Imagine the sixties without love and peace
A big apple with jackboots out on the streets
Imagine America controlled by a despot
Turning everything he holds to a cesspit
Death to the death's head moth
The totenkopf
We won't stop 'til it's totally broken off
Throw hands with the oberkommando
Chuck a bone at the panzerhund
Hand over
Power to the people and allow them to be equal
Well at least 'til they announce another sequel
But for now we'll assist the resistance
In opposition to a system
Insisting we're ripped from existence
Frau Engel
A frown on her brow
That'll make a man tremble
Break a man's mettle like the end of a pencil
Pressed on a page and proclaiming your death
Your witness
To a harsh harsh mistress
But BJ'll get the last laugh yet
Yes
Get the cat to chase the mouse
Set the trap, eradicate the Frau
Where's the master race now
And what is a new colossus
When they want to nuke the lot of us?
This is the start of an insurrection
Giving protection from unhinged infection
But we ditch the syringe and medicine
For a big metal thing that lead is in
So let us in
Most of us have never been beheaded
Let alone at the Lincoln thing and on the telly
'Tis but a scratch, an itch
Who dares to spill the blood of Blazkowicz
A last ditch attempt to tempt fate and escape
But it's too late for that you nazi bitch

The best you got?
Your best won't do
Now you are the weak
And this is your doom
You are among wolves now
And these
Are our woods, our howls, and our feast
There, when the smoke clears
And the flames
And all's laid to waste
One man remains
Frau, can you feel it, can you see?
No army left
It's just you and me
X2




 I'm driving a titan without a licence
These mean beasts begin at like five tons
It's a cypher like no other
Tough mudder got you frightened
You're no object
Though you claim you're heavyweight like Tyson
Nah, sure, now let me change your mind
BYE SON, go away
Because i say so, k ho?
And stay in focus
Or you'll face a plague of locusts
Crusading over your terrain 'til you're run over
The rain is soaking us making progress slow as a tortoise
Time to revise on what our training courses taught us
You're in dangerous waters
So call a priest, it's actually urgent
Observe a pattern emerging
And learn the lesson Kaiser Franz Ferdinand didn't learn
I'm a hellcat, a mashup of a panther
And Samuel L Jackson in shaft with a birch gun
I'm the real deal though, not just a nice actor
Typecast to plough up the ground
Like tractors

Tanks are big!
Big are tanks!
Would you like a normal sized car?
No thanks!

I'm a tiger you're a mouse
All up in my grill
So if you don't want to be killed
Then you best get out
I drive a wespe
You ride a vespa
When i tell you to be my valentine
You reply "Yes Sir!"
I bet that you can't even invent a pun for hetzer
Well nor can but i don't care
Cause i am still the best at world of tanks
And it's a fact, i'm absolutely sure, man
Whether you're a yank
Jap, Chinese, frog, russian or german
I'm churchill meets cromwell
With a dash of wolverine
Smash and pulverise you into smithereens jauntily
Chin up, keep a cheery demeanour
Follow the covenant
I am a leopard, you're a cheetah
Without the cunning
I'ma hun a lullaby, put out your lights
You're out of luck, son
You're an alpha prototype
I am the GOTY, uh uh!
I got more ram too
Use it to ram you
You dick, i maxed out my contraption can do
You're stuart little
I'm bigger, i'm better, i'm harder too
You're cruising for a bruising, sport
There's nothing your side can do
My team are bishops
Yours are weedy vicards
I'm a combat cardinal conquering comet
Aw bless, you peed your knickers

Tanks are big!
Big are tanks!
Would you like a normal sized car?
No thanks!




 Welcome to the next generation…


Man, I feel like a superstar
In a high powered supercar
Shoot for the stars, no stopping me
I’m revving up a cacophony
Doesn’t matter whatever you offer me
Won’t swap it for anything, honestly
The road ahead of me’s calling
And pole position is where I’ve just got to be
I’m an ace in a race, set a pace
That’ll take you to a range of places
Make you say “Ooh, great, amazing”
A trail in my wake as I blaze away
‘cause it’s the way that I make my paper
Do me a favour: Get out of my way, bruh
Boy racer with places to be
So it’s safe to say I’ll see you later

Forza Motorsport
Will open doors to a sort of ocean port
That’ll flow a course from coast to shores
The poetry of motion’s yours
Saddle up, we’re going on tour
You’ll ride astride your chosen horse
Through a load of applause
Such force
You were only supposed to blow the doors
Horsepower, galloping gallantly
Shoot for the stars, Galileo Galilei
Hey! Don’t prang my McClaren, geez
The tab to patch up the damage
Is grand as your annual salary
And apparently you just cannot handle me
So hand me the keys as I shoot for the stars
Blasting these supercars
To a brand new galaxy
Let’s go!


There's dead on every street
The city's a cemetery
So evidently, you better believe
It's better to get up and leave
If that's something you'll ever achieve
Well then you will need to get a bit mean
With the endless sea of horrendous beings
That'll see your flesh as a delicacy
They want to find out how your meat tastes
One bite is all it takes
Should you make a small mistake
They'll make you their next gourmet steak
The stakes have been raised, son
Can you stave the invasion?
From the cradle, to the grave, you'll save
All walks of life and death when you slay them

I'll make tools, then I slay fools
Though I break rules, stay faithful
To the label of a fellow cutting straight through you
From the nape of the neck to the navel
Maybe it's painful, maybe it's not
I don’t know, your brains are all rotten
And though you may have forgotten the way that it was
I won't let you forget when I take you to God
With a homemade blade aimed straight at your schnoz
I don't suppose there'll be that much tissue left
To let you blow your nose
And so it goes on
The contagion continues
It'll blatantly take
Every grain of the patience
And latent frustration
That's waiting within you
Skill…
Let's take it back!


Rome, the place I name as my home
Made it my own and I’ll die before I see it overthrown
I’m one of the most valiant fighters
I’m known as Marius Titus
This city’s in my blood
As valuable as my life is
With all of the troops, Legions at hand
We’re ruling a huge region of land
Reaching through France and even Britannia
And for that, we’ve Caesar to thank
For seizing it and I think of the man
When I’m leading a siege and I see that the ranks
Are in need of command, eager to mangle
A people as weak as we are grand
Ryse...

This isn’t my kind of war
The thing that I’m fighting for
Gibbon’s Decline and Fall
Didn’t begin describing all
The wicked things that Titus saw
His sight is raw, his eyes are sore
Lives withdrawn with violent force
Civilian killing with knives and swords
Now my kids and wife are torn asunder
Souls all but plundered
I hunger for vengeance on the men responsible
I’ve called their number
I’m a lord of thunder
Striding right in with the force and might
Of lightning strikes, I will never bore or tire
Of war or fighting
RYSE!
Welcome to the next generation!




 Following total atomic annihilation
It may fall to you to save the great nation
That's why Vault-Tec have made extra preparation
And are proud to present you a special education
Regarding aptitude
You are an absolutely
Unique amalgamation of attributes
Now it's time to find out in which you excel
What makes you S.P.E.C.I.A.L.?

You're special! (3x)
Oh so special!
S.P.E.C.I.A.L
Spells out that you're quite swell!

Strength!
Supplies are sparse
So on seeing something sweet
Be sure to scavenge, or starve
The stronger you aren't, the smaller the stack
Of scrap, storage and snacks
That you can haul on your back
But do be sure to stay on track of the numbers
Or a savage could suddenly strike as you're over-encumbered
And should your special self have such a regrettable incident
You'd better get swinging any suitable weapon or implement
Perception!
Post-nuclear places
Are pretty prearranged
To put you through your paces
Pinpoint the parts of predators that plan to prey
With the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System
Hooray!
You may need to pickpocket
Pinching for your own protection
Practicing your pilfering
Purloining to perfection
If your preferential predilection's
Petty theft of peoples' possessions
You'll be protected by perception


Endurance!
Epidemics are endemic everywhere
Infection, amputation, radiation, never rare
End the negative effects, refresh your energy
By eating everything
Even extra limbs and enemies
Your belly's not ever empty
There's endless entrées
Extend the length of time you exercise
Eons, days
Escape encounters with louts and rowdy hooligans
Or environments ensure you'll eventually be food again
Charisma!
Communists conquered this clean continent
And concomitantly, corruption was the consequence
As such, you must be confident
And cognizant of compliments
Confirming that commercially you're consummately competent
Convert companions to confidantes
Convincing them to change a cuddly toy
For cutlery and condiments
Swallow down countless cups of cocktails
And charm your way from harm, chum
Combat curtailed


Intelligence!
Is idiocy inverted
Innate instinct
Take information and interpret it
The inner intuition and initiative
To impliment inventive ideas
To be inquisitive
It is indicative of ingrained imagination
To take an inspiration and create an innovation
Insure against injury through investigation
Because ignorance induces incapacitation
Agility!
After all the aggro
Antagonists are all too available
There's no ASBOs
Accelerate your acts of accurate aim
And have any angry adversaries aptly aflame
Avoid adverse assaults from automatics
Avert or annul their action with acrobatics
Agility!
Amazing adaptability
Awesome!
What an absolutely ace ability


Luck!
The lady
That lowers the likelihood of life's lotto's loss for the lazy
When you're larking with lice
That are larger than life
At least you'll have the lethal last laugh and the like
The lie of the land's less than lavish and lovely
But when looking for loot you'll locate lots of luxury
Loads of little lowlifes leering at your luggage?
A lone laddy's liable to let them learn what luck is
Congratulations, you've passed the test
Yes!
From everyone at Vault-Tec
Splendid work on your success
Give yourself a pat on the back
And maybe shake hands
Then perambulate into the haze of the wasteland
War
War never changes
Look at the history book's torn up pages
Cause when the dust settles after all out war
You'll be glad we taught you what to deal with fallout for
 x2
