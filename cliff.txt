And bless the Lord for love again
Bring peace on earth goodwill to men
It's the future not the past
Lets have a:
First night

Child is born
Safe and warm

For blessing you and me
Sometimes we watch and wonder
Has Christmas lost its touch?
Can a world beyond the money
Be worth that much?
And tonight as we thank Bethlehem
And bless the Lord for love again
Bring peace on earth, goodwill to men
The future is the past
We'll have a:
First night
Star bright

 This couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never, again
Again, this couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever




 Angel face, we just met
Well, just how lucky can one boy get
There's a light in your eyes
I know it's love and I know that I could be happy
With a girl like you, umm-umm
Tell your ma, tell your pa
And tell your favorite old wishing star
We're in love, just by chance
I ask of you, would you like to dance
Fancy dancing, with a girl like you
*Funny how love can come to a lonely heart
I'm a boy, you're a girl
I guess that's a pretty good start
1. Here I am, there you are (2. Here am I, there you are)
Together baby we should go far
A girl like you, a boy like me
Two hearts together like they ought to be (last time to Coda)
Can't believe, I've got a girl like you, (umm-umm)
(Repeat from *)
Coda:
Can't believe, I've got a girl like you
Got a girl like you, got a girl like you......
(Fade Out)




 I'm better off without you
I'm better off you know
We're nothing more than strangers
With nowhere else to go
But like a fool I'll stay by your side
Knowing that you won't believe me
When I say I've tried
A heart will break tonight
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight
A heart will break and I won't feel the same
Cause you stay just the same as you are
And a heart will break tonight
We made no commitment
We made only words
It's no consolation that we're free like the birds
Cause who needs to fly like they do
There's only one reason I'm staying
It's cause I love you... I do
A heart will break tonight
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight
A heart will break and I won't feel the same
Cause you stay just the same as you are
And a heart will break tonight
A heart will break tonight
Make no mistake I'll lie awake tonight
A heart will break and I won't feel the same
Cause you stay just the same as you are
And a heart will break tonight
Tonight it's gonna break
Don't know if I'll make it
Thru' the night... Oh oh oh oh...

 All at once, it's you, it's you for me
And all at once, there's blossom on each tree
It's so thrilling and so new to me
This enchantment that you do to me
And forever in your spell I'll be
All at once, my doubts and fears are past
I feel as though I've come back home at last
I thought I was fancy-free, till I felt this magic glow
Now, it's you for me and all at once I know
All at once, my doubts and fears are past
I feel as though I've come back home at last
I thought I was fancy-free, till I felt this magic glow
Now, it's you for me and all at once I know




 No more talk of darkness
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
My words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom
Let daylight dry your tears
I'm here, with you, beside you
To guard you and to guide you

Say you love me
Every waking moment
Turn my head
With talk of summertime
Say you need me
With you now and always
Promise me
That all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you

All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you, always beside me
To hold me and to hide me

Then say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
Let me lead you
From you solitude
Say you want me with you
Here beside you
Anywhere you go
Let me go too
That's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me
One love, one lifetime
 Say the word
And I will follow you
Share each day with me
Each night, each morning

Say you love me

You know I do

Love me
That's all I ask of you
Love me
That's all I ask of you




 All my love came to nothing at all my love
When I woke up to find
You were no longer mine
All my love thrown away after all this time
Now there's no place for me in the future
You see
I don't understand you
I've done all I can do
Tell me how could I give you more
More than all my love




 All my love came to nothing at all my love
When I woke up to find
You were no longer mine
All my love thrown away after all the time
Now there's no place for me in the future
You see
I don't understand you
I've done all I can do
Tell me how could I give you more
More than all my love




 Now there's only one thing that money can't buy
True love - that will never die....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten
Carefree lovers down country lane
Don't know my grief, can't feel the pain....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten
But it's too late, my love - too late - but never mind....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten
Now there's one more thing that troubles my mind
My love has gone - left me behind....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten
But it's too late, my love - too late - but never mind....
All my sorrows - soon forgotten
All my sorrows - soon forgotten
All my sorrows - soon forgotten (fade out)




 I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile and my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it, too
Does the feeling seem, oh, so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I just can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please, love me or I'll be gone
'Cause I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
And though you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong, so wrong
Oh, what are you thinking of?
I'm thinking about you're gone
What are you thinking of?
How do we go so wrong?
Ooh, I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
It can't be too late to say that I was so wrong
Oh, here I'm all out of love
Nothing without you
And I know it was so wrong, so wrong, so wrong




 The love in you and the love in me
Is all that matters
All the rest is just vanity that time will shatter
The only treasure in the life we live
Is on the measure of the love we give
All that matters in the end will be
The love in you and the love in me
It's all that matters
Every heart must change its shape
To fit the space that a lifetime makes
Some regrets and some mistakes
We touch happiness but we can't hold her
Feelings come and disappear
I've known the laughter I've cried those tears
I should know better after all these years
But I'm no wiser I'm just older
The love in you and the love in me
Is all that matters
All the rest is just vanity that time will shatter
The only treasure in the life we live
Is on the measure of the love we give
All that matters in the end will be
The love in you and the love in me
It's all that matters
Love is the treasure
It's all a question of priority
We've got some much that we just don't need
If it ain't got love then it's a luxury
We can learn to live without it
The love in you and the love in me
Is all that matters
All the rest is just vanity that time will shatter
It's all that matters
It's all that matters
Oh...
The love in you and the love in me
It's all that matters
All the rest is vanity that time will shatter
The love in you and the love in me
Is all that matters...




 You say that I'll survive
That I'll get over you
But if you walk away that door
Then what am I gonna 'do
They say you don't appreciate love
Until it's gone
Well I guess I'll love you more
Since I've known what was goin' on
It's so easy to say
That I'll miss you when you're gone
But if this is the end
Then the damage has been done
Where did I go wrong
How could I believe that we are history, my love
Even though you give yourself to someone else
I will give you all the time you need to work things out
When all of the excitement gone
And you're wondering where you went wrong
Please remember me
I guess I've got to learn to give you room to breathe
When all I really want to do is love you close to me
They say that I have got to be tough
That God will see me through
And though I know you love me
I'm confused, 'cos he wants me to be with you
I have never felt so very much alone
But if this is the end oh then I guess I'll carry on
No matter what you've done
How could I believe that we are history, my love
Even though you give yourself to someone else
I will give you all the time you need to work things out
When all of the excitement gone
And you're wondering where you went wrong
Please remember me
I will give you all the time you need to work things out
When all of the excitement gone
And you're wondering where you went wrong
Please, remember me
Please, won't you remember me
I'll be waiting here, got nowhere to go
I'll be waiting
Remember me
Remember, remember
Please remember me
Remember, remember, remember me
Remember, remember, remember me
Remember, remember, remember me
I'll be waiting




 Some people, they tease one another
Take pride in themselves, keeping the other one down
Well, I'm not like that at all
Some people, they hurt one another
They love to see hurt in the other one's eyes
Well, I'm not like that at all
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one's hand
They always understand
Some people cry
Some people know why
Some people, they use one another so aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well, I'm not like that at all
Some people they long for each other
They love to talk holding the other one's hand
They always understand
Some people cry
Some people know why
With a word unspoken with a voice unheard
When a word is broken by a tender word
When a heart is moved, when a heart is thrown
The silence tells you, you're not alone
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk holding the other one
Holding the other one
Holding each other




 In a matter of moments, in a matter of moments
In a matter of moments, in a matter of moments
I fell in love in a matter of moments
And the world was mine
And the world was mine
My dreams came true in a matter of moments
And my world was you
Yes my world was you
Oh! bird of paradise you open up your wings
You showed me all the things
That I wanted to see
So if love calls in a matter of moments
Then the world is yours
Then the world is yours
Oh bird of paradise you open up your wings
And you showed me all the things
That I wanted to see
So if love calls in matter of moments
Then the world is yours
Then the world is yours




 Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures;
He will be my shield and portion be
As long as life endures
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess, within the veil
A life of joy and peace
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun




 The story is a famous one
Now worshiped, now dismissed
Rehearsed and trawled for meanings
That may well not exist
The demon at the story's heart
The cuckoo in the nest
Gives little of himself away
Which is of course why you will stay
In case he falters, should betray
By whom or what possessed
These are the facts of the matter
These are the names in the case
This is the story, the passion
The time and the place
They're laid here before you
So judge if you can
The devil incarnate or
A misunderstood man
His origins, his way of life
His motives they're all news
No shortage of detractors
To air their noisy views
The man inspires a thousand lies
The lover takes his choice
Remaining coldly in control
Aware that sadly, on the whole
It is the fool who bares his soul
I'll give the man a voice
These are the facts of the matter
These are the names in the case
This is the story, the passion
The time and the place
They're laid here before you
So judge if you can
The devil incarnate or
A misunderstood man




 I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her




 Angel, with those angel eyes
Come and take this earth boy
Up to paradise
Angel, may I hold you tight?
I never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight
If I said "I love you"
Would I be speaking out of turn?
I'm only human
But I'm willing to learn
Angel, make my wish come true
Let me be in heaven
Here on earth with you

 Well, it's good to be free, I don't want to breeze
They come and they go, whenever I please
Well honey, your love is good for my wings
'Cause I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
I kiss you goodnight, and what do I do?
I hurry on home and I dream about you
It's crazy I know, but it's just one of those things
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
Well, you hold my hand and that burn like a fire
You kiss my lips and the flame goes higher
Such a lucky devil to find a little lady like you
Well, I'm crossing my heart and telling no lies
So hold me real close and close your eyes
I think you're real close, like I need to cling
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
Well, I kiss you goodnight, and what do I do?
Well, I hurry on home and I dream about you
Well, it's crazy I know, but it's just one of those things
Well, I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
Well, you hold my hand and I burn like a fire
You kiss my lips and the flame goes higher
Such a lucky devil to find a little lady like you
Well, I'm crossing my heart and telling no lies
So hold me real close and close your eyes
Well, I think you're real close, like I need to cling
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings
I wanna be tied, tied, tied, tied, tied to your apron strings




 You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by




 My heart was so heavy with longin' for you
My arms were so lonely, lonesome and blue
Alone in my sorrow, I heard a voice cry
A voice in the wilderness, a voice from the sky
Have faith in your darlin', the voice seemed to say
Be true to her memory, she'll come back one day
And though there was no one, nobody to see
A voice in the wilderness brought comfort to me
We had a quarrel, I was unkind
Why did you leave me? Love made me blind
My darlin', forgive me, I yearn for your touch
Have pity, come back now, I need you so much
Believe me and you'll hear it
That voice from above
A voice in the wilderness
The voice of true love
Believe me and you'll hear it
That voice from above
A voice in the wilderness
The voice of true love




 It’s not the way you smile
That touched my heart, no-no
It’s not the way you kiss
That tears my apart
Oh-oh, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do?
I can’t help myself
‘Cause baby it’s you
You should hear what they say about you
They say, they say you’ve never, never
Never ever been true, cheat
It doesn’t matter what they say
I know I’m gonna love you any old way
What can I do?
When it’s true
I don’t want nobody, nobody
‘Cause baby it’s you
Oh-oh, It doesn’t matter what they say
I know I’m gonna love you any old way
What can I do?
When it’s true
I don’t want nobody, nobody baby
‘Cause baby it’s you
Baby just you, baby it’s you, baby it’s you




 Explosive Situation
I got no explanation
Love has shout out of the blue - hitting me, and you
It isn't just attraction
It's more a chain reaction
Our love is no ricochet - won't go astray

Love's got me in it's line of fire

You're dynamite
Your lips are so inviting

You've got the power of thunder and lightning-
You're dynamite
I can't light the fuse and then retire
Love's got me in it's line of fire

Oo baby it's dynamite
You've got the power of thunder and lightning-
You're dynamite




 When I was young, my father said
"Son, I've got something to say."
And what he told me I'll never forget until my dying day
He said, "Son, you'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you'll be a bachelor boy until your dying day."
When I was sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as can be
But I remembered just in time what my daddy said to me
He said, "Son, you'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you'll be a bachelor boy until your dying day."
As time goes by, I probably will meet a girl and fall in love
Then, I'll get married, have A-wife and A-child
And they'll be my turtle dove
But until then, I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay-yay-yay
Happy to be a bachelor boy until my dying day
Yeah, I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay-yay-yay
Happy to be a bachelor boy until my dying day

But until then, I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay-yay-yay
Happy to be a bachelor boy until my dying day
Yeah, I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay-yay-yay
Happy to be a bachelor boy until my dying day




 When I was young, my father said
"Son, I've got something to say."
And what he told me I'll never forget until my dying day
He said, "Son, you'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you'll be a bachelor boy until your dying day."
When I was sixteen I fell in love
With a girl as sweet as can be
But I remembered just in time what my daddy said to me
He said, "Son, you'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way to stay
Son, you'll be a bachelor boy until your dying day."
As time goes by, I probably will meet a girl and fall in love
Then, I'll get married, have A-wife and A-child
And they'll be my turtle dove
But until then, I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay-yay-yay
Happy to be a bachelor boy until my dying day
Yeah, I'll be a bachelor boy
And that's the way I'll stay-yay-yay
Happy to be a bachelor boy until my dying day




 What did I ever do for you, that you should die for me
And what did I ever give to you, that you should live in me
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way
As I was, I am and always will be, will be
Be in my heart, be in my head
Be in my soul tonight
Live in my words, let it be said
Live in my life tonight
Pray that I never take in vain, the name I hold most dear
His love in very heart of me, casts out all doubt and fear
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way
As I was, I am and always will be, will be
Be in my heart, be in my head
Be in my soul tonight
Live in my words, let it be said
Live in my life tonight
Tonight we shall sweetly sleep
Tonight by still waters deep
Tonight for my soul to keep, still waters lead me to your
Still waters, I need to drink of your still waters
Now that I know the kind of love that comes to fill me up
Fill me anew with love from you and overflow my cup
Now and forever and always true, your love has found a way
As I was, I am and always will be, will be
Be in my heart, be in my head
Be in my soul tonight
Live in my words, let it be said
Live in my life tonight
Still waters, running deep
Still waters, my soul to keep
Still waters, it's your love flowing over me




 I've sailed an ocean
I've sailed an ocean before you
Thought I was free
Thought that I was free before I met you
Now I'm no longer the same
I've found the dream that
I have been waiting for
I'm always calling your name
Feeling joy that I never knew before
Let's celebrate this better day
I've climbed a mountain
I've climbed a mountain before you
Thought I was wise
Thought I was wise before I met you
Now everything is so clear
I want to be beside you
Won't ever leave you
And I am so lost in love
That every day I'm waiting for you
I just want to here with you
Just want to be with you
Just want to be where you are
It's all I need
And we'll celebrate this better day
This destiny
Has been designed for me by someone
This mystery
Has all the signs to make me hold on
There'll come a day I know now
A better day when we will belong together
It's just a touch away now
Just a kiss and we will be there
I just want to here with you
Just want to be with you
Just want to be where you are
It's all I need
And we'll celebrate this better day
It's just a touch away now
Just a kiss and we will be there
I just want to here with you
Just want to be with you
Just want to be where you are
It's all I need
And we'll celebrate this better day
This better day
This better day




 You were there - at the moment I began
When the child became a man
Saw my future in the making - saw the path my life was taking
You saw a million things I'll never understand
You know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Time after time you've shown it to be true
That no one loves me like you
You are here so let it rain or let it shine
You are with me all the time
When I'm waking - When I'm sleeping
In the secret thoughts I'm keeping
You know everything about this heart of mine
You know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Time after time you've shown it to be true
That no one loves me like you
You'll be there - when the end of time has come
And I know you'll take me home
So I thank you for tomorrow
All my joys and all my sorrows
And I thank you for the greatest thing I've known
You know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Time after time you've shown it to be true
That no one loves me like you




 REFRAIN
I'm wild again
Beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
Couldn't sleep
And wouldn't sleep
Until I could sleep where I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
Lost my heart but what of it?
My mistake I agree
He's a laugh, but I like it
Because the laugh's on me




 May she wake in torment
Never to find
Any kind of comfort
In death
May her lies satanic
That corrupt even now
Bring her back to confront
Me again
These are words of hatred
Words of contempt
Only one who suffered
At the hands and the heart
Of a woman who stole
Both his life and soul
Be with me always
Possess me and haunt me
Take any form
Or take none
Be with me always
In flesh or as a ghost
And you'll learn as the ages run
Learn what your sin has done
Who is my protector?
Whence comes my help?
Who is there to calm me
But she
God shall be my witness
That I pray she will know
Not one moment of rest
In the cold cold ground
Be with me always
Consume and invade me
Take any shape or disguise
Be with me always
To share all my despair
And to learn nothing justifies
Reckless inhuman lies
Here comes the night
The abyss unrelenting
Casting all reason aside
And I see in myself
All the things I see in you
Hear the savage I am crying
Be with me always...

 I was at a dance when he caught my eye
Standin' all alone lookin' sad and shy
We began to dance, swaying' to and fro
And soon I knew I'd never let him go
Blame it on the bossa nova with its magic spell
Blame it on the bossa nova that he did so well
Oh, it all began with just one little dance
But then it ended up a big romance
Blame it on the bossa nova
The dance of love
(Now was it the moon?)
No, no, the bossa nova
(Or the stars above?)
No, no, the bossa nova
(Now was it the tune?)
Yeah, yeah, the bossa nova
(The dance of love)
Now I'm glad to say I'm his bride to be
And we're gonna raise a family
And when our kids ask how it came about
I'm gonna say to them without a doubt
Blame it on the bossa nova with its magic spell
Blame it on the bossa nova that he did so well
Oh, it all began with just one little dance
But then it ended up a big romance
Blame it on the bossa nova
The dance of love
(Now was it the moon?)
No, no, the bossa nova
(Or the stars above?)
No, no, the bossa nova
(Now was it the tune? )
Yeah, yeah, the bossa nova
(The dance of love)
(Now was it the moon?)
No, no, the bossa nova
(Or the stars above ?)
No, no, the bossa nova




 I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill where I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered till my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Tho' we're apart you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill




 Blue Moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me,"
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own




 Blue moon

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper "please adore me,"

 Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off
Of my blue suede shoes
Well, you can knock me down, step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off
Of my blue suede shoes
You can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruitjar
Do anything that you want to do, but uh-uh
Honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off
Of my blue suede shoes




 Well, now that she is gone
You won't feel bad for long
For maybe just an hour
Or just a moment of the day
Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
And you don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her
Find her, find her
You think you'll have a ball
And you won't hurt at all
You'll find another girl
Or maybe more to pass the time away
Then blue turns grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
And you don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her
Find her, find her
And you know that
You must find her
Find her, find her
She's not home when you call
So you then go to all
All the places where she likes to be
But she has gone away
Then blue turns to grey
And try as you may
You just don't feel good
And you don't feel alright
And you know that you must find her
Find her, find her
Blue turns to grey
Blue turns to grey
Blue turns to grey




 Ooh she's just a broken doll - she ain't no
Use at all - since you've been gone
Ooh she's just a broken toy - she's no ones
Pride and joy - look what you've done
You had her on a string
You made a fool of her
And that's an awful thing
She thought she'd paid her fare
Now you've gone and you just don't care
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll
You can't wind her up - altough the key fits
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll
Someone's thrown away all the pieces
Now you've played your wicked game
Don't you feel no shame
Look what you've done!
Now she's just a broken girl while you're
All around the world - having your fun
She had you in her heart
You made a fool of her right from the very start
She thought she'd paid her fare
Now you've gone and you just don't care
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll
You can't wind her up - altough the key fits
You can't wind her up - she's a broken doll
Someone's thrown away all the pieces
Ooh she's just a broken toy - she's no ones
Pride and joy - look what you've done
You had her on a string
You made a fool of her
And that's an awful thing
She thought she'd paid her fare
Now you've gone and you just don't care




 Brother to brother, heart to heart
There's something I've been trying to tell you
No matter where you are
From cradle to shining star
You're someone to look up to
Brother to brother worlds apart
One day I'll promise I'll be with you
Always I'll love you
Now just a memory
A lifetime of rivalry
I couldn't have a better friend than you
I used to criticize the way you used to be
The child that had the look that dreams are made of
A window to the past looks onto everything I see
The fire went out the flame just dies
I couldn't have a better friend than you
Brother to brother, when we meet again
There'll be no differences between us
Free from the darkest night, free till we see the light
Burning ever after
Time is a healer, calming our fears
A thousand questions left unanswered
Oh I believe in you
Brother of mine
Have you ever had somebody you were close to
Become a memory that's larger than life
Have you ever felt there's beauty in distortion
If faiths a crime give me a clue
And if it is then brother it's still you




 There's two things I know for sure
She was sent here from heaven, and she's daddy's little girl
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus, and I close my eyes
And I thank God for all the joy in my life, But most of all...
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
"Walk beside the pony daddy, it's my first ride."
"I know the cake looks funny, daddy, but I sure tried."
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses at night
Sweet sixteen today
She's looking like her momma a little more every day
One part woman, the other part girl
To perfume and makeup, from ribbons and curls
Trying her wings in a great big world. But I remember...
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
"You know how much I love you daddy, but if you don't mind
I'm only going to kiss you on cheek this time."
With all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses at night
All the precise time
Like the wind, the years go by
Precious butterfly, spread your wings and fly
She'll change her name today
She'll make a promise, and I'll give her away
Standing in the bride room just staring at her
She asked me what I'm thinking, and I said, "I'm not sure
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl."
Then she leaned over... and gave me...
Butterfly kisses, with her mama there
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
"Walk me down the aisle daddy, it's just about time."
"Does my wedding gown look pretty daddy?" "Daddy don't cry."
With all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right
To deserve a hug every morning, and butterfly kisses
I couldn't ask God for more, man, this is what love is
I know I've gotta let her go, but I'll always remember
Every hug in the morning, and butterfly kisses...




 I just got to tell someone about the way I feel
Shout it from the rooftop to the street
And if I spread the word please tell me
Who's it gonna hurt?
I'm in love with you girl
Let me talk to the world
I feel like I'm up there riding a rocket to the moon
And I'm gonna tell them where I've been
Can't keep this feelin' in, not for another minute
I can't hold it back, you know I'm trying to
I just gotta count the ways, you bless my days
Baby, I can't keep this feelin' in
Some things should be private
Just between the two of us
Trust me when I say my lips are sealed
My god it's no big secret that I'm crazy for your love
Want to put up a sign that the lady is mine
If you're superstitious I'm gonna try to hold it down
But I'm going out there on a limb
Can't keep this feelin' in, not for another minute
I can't hold it back, you know I'm trying to
I just gotta count the ways, you bless my days
Baby, I can't keep this feelin' in
I know it's better if we take it slow
That's when the hours feel like years
I've gotta tell somebody that's all I know
If I've gotta whisper, whisper in their ears
Can't keep this feelin' in, not for another minute
I can't hold it back, you know I'm trying to
I just gotta count the ways, you bless my days
Baby, I can't keep this feelin' in




 Now that the past has ended
My life's an open door
I know that we could have been mended
Oh but I can't take the hurt anymore
Can't take the hurt anymore
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore
The rainbow's over
But I've seen it leave before
A love that's been left in the corner
Ooh cos I can't take the hurt anymore
Can't take the hurt anymore
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore
Lady of my lady's
Can't we find the right
And leave behind the sorrow
Lady of my lady's
Can't we find the light
Bright enough to guide us
Can't take the hurt anymore
Ooh ooh can't take the hurt anymore
This love grows older
But I've felt it all before
Yesterday's over my shoulder
Ooh cos I can't take the hurt anymore
Can't take the hurt anymore
Ah ah can't take the hurt anymore
My love I found has lost it's crown
But I just can't leave it die
I fool myself and no one else
Cos I would if I could and I try
Can't take the hurt anymore etc....




 Sorry to disturb you
But I was in the neighbourhood
About a friend, I've her picture
Could you take a look?
Oh, I appreciate you're busy
And time is not your own
Yeah, maybe it would be better
If I telephoned
Carrie doesn't live here anymore
Carrie used to room on the second floor
Sorry that she left no forwarding address
That was known to me
Carrie doesn't live here anymore
You could always ask at the corner store
Carrie had a date with her own kind of fate
It's plain to see
Another missing person
One of many we assume
The young wear their freedom
Like cheap perfume
(It's useless information) Returning my call
(To help the situation) They've nothing at all
You're just another message
On a payphone wall
Carrie doesn't live here anymore
Carrie used to room on the second floor
Sorry that she left no forwarding address
That was known to me
Carrie doesn't live here anymore
You could always ask at the corner store
Carrie had a date with her own kind of fate
It's plain to see
Carrie doesn't live here anymore
Carrie used to room on the second floor
Sorry that she left no forwarding address
That was known to me
Carrie doesn't live here anymore
You could always ask at the corner store
Carrie had a date with her own kind of fate
It's plain to see




 (Catch me) I'm fallin' for you x 3
What was in that kiss you gave me?
Never felt like this, please save me
Catch me in your arms I'm fallin' for you little girl
Someone fooled around and let me
Always in her heart you set me
Catch me in your arms I'm fallin' for you little girl
I never thought I'd tumble
Head over heels on my face
But here I go tumbling all over the place
Make my tipsy heart go crazy
Kiss me once again, what's a daisy
Catch me in your arms
I'm fallin'for you little girl
(Catch me) I'm faliin' for you......
I never thought I'd tumble....... ( repeat)
Catch me, I'm fallin' for you ..........




 I've tried to ignore
All the stench of your life
Only holding back
For my wife
Even she has seen
Your poisoned soul displayed
Seen each move you've made
Contaminate, degrade
Who's this juvenile?
Who's this infantile clown?
He's not ever worth
Knocking down
Stamp your tiny foot
My precious little lamb
Bleat ad nauseam
But i don't give a damn
Where to go? heart ever hounded
Coward? no - spirit confounded
Always hoping belief will bring release
God alone can give me peace
Watching me scream and hate
Only choosing when it's too late
May this imbecile
Cause your heart to feel joy
You did after all
Choose the toy
Do you now suppose
I'll leave with no reply?
Basic laws apply
An eye demands an eye
Where to go? heart ever hounded
Coward? no - spirit confounded
Always hoping belief will bring release
God alone can give peace
Watching me scream and hate
Only choosing when it's too late

M is for the misletoe where everyone is kissed
A is for the angels who make up the christmas list

Be good and he'll bring you everything in your Christmas Alphabet!

 Talk about the heart of Christmas
Talk about the reason and the rhyme
Talk about the sentimental feelings
Talk about the candlelight and wine
Talk about the children
Listen to the voices singing
Listen to the laughter as they play
But listen to the whisper of a heartbeat
Whose loneliness is never far away

In some hearts it's never Christmas
But it's winter all the time
All our lives spent waiting for the sun
Children of tomorrow
How they need a star to follow
In some hearts it's always winter
For some hearts it seems
That Christmas never comes
Don't forget the winter's children
Shadows on a star that never shines
Looking for the love that never happened
Looking for the Chris in Christmas time
The lonely voice
That can't rejoice
That has no choice

In some hearts it's never Christmas
But it's winter all the time
All our lives spent waiting for the sun
Children of tomorrow
How they need a star to follow
In some hearts it's always winter
For some hearts it seems
That Christmas never comes

In some hearts it's never Christmas
But it's winter all the time
All our lives spent waiting for the sun
Children of tomorrow
How they need a star to follow
In some hearts it's always winter
For some hearts it seems
That Christmas never comes




 The city in defeat
With no one left to beat
There's still a fading desire
To burn a naked light
Just to defy the night
Come on and call me a liar
A crumble tumble down
In fumble bumble town
Our lives a ruin
We reconstruct a bit
And pretty up a bit
We hardly know what we're doing
Chorus:
But me and my baby
Make the best of this world
She's like a diamond
Innocent girl
We watch the sign of the times
Writing on the wall-Cities may fall
Back through the city fog
I was another cog
For the machinery there
Now the machines have gone
The silence hanging on
I sit, I stare
Chorus Repeated
Come on and take your aim
I feel the mildest pain
Protecting something so rare
Cause there's a gem or two
Inside the human zoo
If only you are aware
Chorus Repeated




 I got you
I got you
I got you
I got you and clear blue skies
Never cold
Never snow
Nobody nobody
Ever knows
I got you
I got you
I got you
I got you and clear blue skies
I see you and
I see you and
I see you and
I see you and clear blue skies
Keep me warm
Summer time
Nobody nobody
Be so kind
I got you
I got you
I got you
I got you and clear blue skies




 Out of time, out of luck
Thought I was just dreamin' then I woke up
You said it was over, the end of the line
I'm telling everybody I'm fine but I'm just
Climbing up Mount Everest
I swear it's like crawling from here to Memphis
Knocked senseless, like
Digging a hole to China to find
You don't love me no more
Night after night, I come home
Watch it on the news who else was overthrown
I don't understand it, as hard as I try
But I keep crossing over the great divide and it's like
Climbing up Mount Everest
I swear it's like crawling from here to Memphis
Knocked senseless, like
Digging a hole to China to find
You don't love me no more
Shine the light, ring the bell
I guess you don't love me, well
Well, I'll go on, I'll survive
I don't know how but I'll try
It's just like
Digging a hole to China to find
You don't love me no more
It's just like
Digging a hole to China to find
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
You don't love me no more
No more




 Congratulations and celebrations
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me
Congratulations and jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
Who could believe that I could be happy and contented
I used to think that happiness hadn't been invented
But that was in the bad old days before I met you
When I let you walk into my heart
Congratulations and celebrations
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me
Congratulations and jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
I was afraid that maybe you thought you were above me
That I was only fooling myself to think you loved me
But then tonight you said you couldn't live without me
That round about me you wanted to stay
Congratulations and celebrations
When I tell everyone that you're in love with me
Congratulations and jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
Congratulations and jubilations
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be




 All day I'm walking in a dream
I think about you constantly
Just like an ever flowing stream
Your memory haunts me constantly
Shadows fall and I try to drive you from my mind
So you're no longer near to me
But my heart sees you there with me
Every sunset you share with me
The rain that patterns through the tree
Reminds me of you constantly
Your name is whispered by the breeze
And love birds bring your song to me
Just as sure as the stars keeps burning in the sky
Your love will stay a flame in me
A flame that burns so bright
Not only through the night but constantly
Just as sure as each star keeps burning in the sky
Your love will stay a flame in me
A flame that burns so bright
Not only through the night but constantly
Though we may be far apart
You're constantly deep in my heart




 You're my love, you're my angel
You're the girl of my dreams
And I'd like to thank you for waiting patiently
Daddy's home
Daddy's home to stay
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friends wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
Daddy's home
Daddy's home to stay
It wasn't on a Sunday
Monday and Tuesday went by
It wasn't on a Tuesday afternoon
All I could do was cry
But I made a promise that you treasure
And I made it back home to you
How I've waited for this moment
To be by your side
Your best friend wrote and told me
You had teardrops in your eyes
Daddy's home
Daddy's home to stay
Daddy's home to stay
I'm not a thousand miles away




 You must've heard of a-little Bo Peep
She was the gal with all the sheep
A woa one day it's a-sad to say
The sheep all ran away
She was lonely and she was blue
She was sad and a-crying too
So I told her what to do
I said "Put on your dancin' shoes"
Put on your dancing shoes
Put on your dancing shoes
Put on your dancing shoes
And dance away your blues
Mmm...
Yeah...
A friend of mine had an accident
Laughed so hard off a wall he went
A-Humpty Dumpty was his name
I guess you've all heard the same
He was lying on the ground
A-bits and pieces all around
So I told him what to do
I said "Put on your dancing shoes"
Put on your dancing shoes
Put on your dancing shoes
Put on your dancing shoes
And dance away your blues
Mmm...
Yeah...
I'm sure you know about Jack and Jill
They're the ones that went up the hill
A-Jack fell down and a-broke his crown
And Jill came tumbling after
What a noise their crying made
It was a-ringing through the glade
So I told them what to do
And I changed their tears to laughter
Put on your dancing shoes
Put on your dancing shoes
Put on your dancing shoes
And dance away your blues
Mmm put on your dancing shoes
Put on your dancing shoes
Put on your dancing shoes




 I've had nothing but bad luck
Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you, sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind
Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me, a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned
I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked in those big green eyes
And I wondered what I came there for
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you from behind
Stay away
Look out
If you're out on a moonlit night
Be careful of them neighbourhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair
Tryin' to win you with her feminine ways
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future, the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
You'd better get out of there fast
She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman
She's gonna get you
(repeats)

 Now you say you belong to me
Do you ever take the time to ask me
If I want to be more involved in your life
It's so sad
You don't realise
What I can do for you
It's so sad
You won't spend more time alone with me
When you could be discovering my love
Can't you see just how much you're hurting me
When you say one thing and then do another
I forgive you
But still you take me for granted
It's so sad
You don't realise
What I can do for you
It's so sad
You won't spend more time alone with me
When you could be discovering my love
You know there are times
When nothing else takes my place
And those times
Mean more to you than anything else
But still you need more of me
And I need more of you - give me more of you
It's so sad
You don't realise
What I can do for you
It's so sad
You won't spend more time alone with me
When you could be discovering my love

 Don't feel bad, don't feel good
Feel alright cause I'm doing as I should
Don't look back, no I don't have the time
I guess I'm doing fine
Got no bags to slow me down
Travelling light but my feet are on the ground
Got no message, I ain't got a dime
I guess I'm doing fine
Don't need no paper telling me bad news
No politician giving their views
Don't need no doctor to tell me I'm well
I feel like heaven and I've been through hell
Talking straight I don't feel confused
Don't want nothing, I've got nothing more to lose
Don't need no credit, don't show me where to sign
I guess I'm doing fine
I guess I'm doing fine
I guess I'm doing fine
Don't come looking for me
Cause I'm doing fine
No missing persons
Cause I'm doing fine
Don't go home
Cause I'm doing fine




 Oh Donna
Oh Doonna
Oh Donna
Oh Donna
I had a girl Donna was her name
Since she left me
Well I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl
Donna where can you be
And now that you're gone
I'm left here all alone
All by myself to wander and roam
How I love my girl
Donna where can you be
Oh Donna
Now that you're gone
I don't know what to do
All my love and all my kisses
Were for you, you just you
I had a girl Donna was her name
Since she's been gone
I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl
Donna where can you be
Oh Donna
Now that you're gone
I don't know what to do
All my love and all my kisses
Were for you
I had a girl Donna was her name
Since she's been gone
I've never been the same
I love my girl
Donna where, where can you be
Oh Donna, Oh Donna, Oh Donna, Oh Donna




 Used to think that life was sweet
Used to think we were so complete
I can't believe you'd throw it away
Used to feel we had it made
Used to feel we could sail away
Can you imagine how I feel today?
Well, it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done?
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny, why we don't talk anymore?
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Oh, we don't talk, ooh
Well, it really doesn't matter to me
I guess your leaving was meant to be
It's down to you now, you wanna be free
Well, I hope you know which way to go
You're on your own again
Don't come crying to me when you're the lonely one
Remember what you've done
Oh, it's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny, why we don't talk anymore?
But I ain't losing sleep and I ain't counting sheep
No, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore, anymore
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Ooh, we don't talk anymore
But I ain't, no, losing sleep
No, I ain't counting sheep
No, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore, anymore
Oh, we don't talk, oh, we don't talk




 Don’t forget to catch me when I fall in love with you
And don’t forget to patch my heart, if it should break in two
It’s just a dream, but a dream that might come true
Don’t forget to catch me when I fall in love with you
Don’t forget to be around in case I need you near
And don’t forget to listen when I whisper in your ear
I think you know, that’s the way it’s gonna be
When I fall in love with you and you with me
Now we could be happy, you know I mean happy
Doing the things you do
I’d sit and talk with you
And maybe steal a little kiss or two from you
Don’t forget to catch me when I fall in love with you
And don’t forget to patch my heart, if it should break in two
It’s just a dream, but a dream that might come true
Don’t forget to catch me when I fall in love with you
I said, don’t forget to catch me when I fall in love with you
Ooh, don’t forget to catch me when I fall in love with you
I said, don’t forget to catch me when I fall in love with you




 Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
Couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore
Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore
Oh, Darling I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, I still have those memories
Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore




 It seems the songs we’re singing
Are all about tomorrow
Tunes of promises you can’t keep
Every moment bringing
The love I could only borrow
You’re telling me lies in your sleep
Do you think I’m not aware?
Of what you’re saying
Or why you’re saying it?
Is it hard to keep me where
You want me staying?
Don’t go on betraying it
Don’t make promises you can’t keep
We had a chance to find it
Our time was now or never
You promised me things that I need
Yeah, but then the things behind it
Took away the chance forever
You’re telling me lies in your sleep
Do you think I’m not aware?
Of what you’re saying
Or why you’re saying it?
Is it hard to keep me where
You want me staying?
Don’t go on betraying it
Don’t make promises you can’t keep
Do you think I’m not aware?
Of what you’re saying
Or why you’re saying it?
Hey, is it hard to keep me where
You want me staying?
Don’t go on betraying it
Don’t make promises you can’t keep
Hey, don’t make promises you can’t keep
Don’t make promises baby, you can’t keep
Hey, don’t make promises baby, that you can’t keep
Oh, don’t make promises baby, you can’t keep




 If some guy tells you, I don't care
And tells you lies while I'm not there
Don't talk to him
If he tells you, I'm untrue
Then darling, here what you must do
Don't talk to him
And if he tells you I've been seen
Walking 'round with Sue and Jean
He's lying again (lying again)
Do anything that you want to
But darling, this I beg of you
Don't talk to him
If you hear the words he has to say
He'll break your heart
Let your love for me prove strong
While we are far apart
So just remember what'd I say
(And) Trust in me while I'm away for I'll be true
And just remember my true love is
Brighter than the moon above for only you
And if this guy should try to say
My love for you is only plain
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)
Just close your eyes and count to ten
And think of me again
But don't you talk to him
And if this guy should try to say
My love for you is only plain
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)
Just close your eyes and count to ten
And think of me again
But don't you talk to him
If you hear the words he has to say
He'll break your heart
Let your love for me prove strong
While we are far apart
So just remember what'd I say
Trust in me while I'm away for I'll be true
And just remember my true love is
Brighter than the moon above for only you
And if this guy should try to say
My love for you is only plain
Nearly a wind (nearly a wind)
Just close your eyes, count to ten
And think of me again
But don't you talk to him




 On my way home I met an
Old friend of mine
We walked and we talked an' shared
A bottle of wine
We started to dance
My intentions were good
How could I know I'd be misunderstood
I promised to call before the weekend
Was thru
We'd all get together so she could
Meet you
I was just being friendly, I met her
By chance
You gotta believe me - it's not a romance
Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out..... Don't turn out the light
You gotta see it from my point
Of view
The same situation could
Happen to you
I said it was over before she left
Town
I can't believe that you're putting me down
Aaahh, It would be easy if you'd lighten up
Do it to please me, enough is enough
All that we've been thru, how can you doubt
The ups an' the downs are what loving's about
Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out..... Don't turn out the light
Mmm, don't turn the light out
Ooohhh, don't turn the light out
Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out..... Don't turn out the light




 Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Men are tied in chains of silence
I look on violence, up, down, left and right
Is there no hope of light
The peaceful hand that once caressed me
Hurts like the rest, because it’s turned to stone
Talons of steel have grown
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Yeah, oh help me, yeah
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
See the moon, it’s getting nearer
But no more clearer than the earth below
What do we really know
I feel the stab of pain returning
Despair is burning in my heart again
Why don’t they see the end, ooooh
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Yeah, throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s drowning in the stormy sea
Yeah, throw down a line, help a poor boy
Who’s hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me




 Do you remember
The first time threat we kiss
Do you remember
It was on a night like this
Stars were up above
A boy and a girl in love
Sudden in your lover's mist
Planning, scheming, hoping and dreaming
From the first time that we kiss
Yes I remember
As you true to me
Yes I remember
That whispers in your ear
I say I love you true
You say you love me too
Sudden in your lover's mist
Planning, scheming, hoping and dreaming
From the first time that we kiss
Yes we'll remember
When we're old and grey
Yes we'll remember
The words we use to say
We'll go back in time, till the day sublime
Sudden in your lover's mist
Planning, scheming, hoping and dreaming
From the first time that we kiss
Mm..................




 Four o'clock, I've been walking all night

If you could only see through my eyes
Then you'd know just what I'm going through
Here am I, I'm taking a chance
In running around with stars in my eyes

4:00 I've been walkin' all night
It's the time I always think of you
If you could only see through my eyes
Then you'd know just what I'm going through
Here am I, I'm takin' a chance
In runnin' around with stars in my eyes
Here am I, I'm lookin' for you
Wonderin' why do I feel so blue
Chorus:
(I'm) I'm dreamin'
Dreamin' of me and you, oh

Dreamin' will see me through
Never letting chances pass me by
I'm gonna dream you right into my life
Yeah, dream you right into my life
(Dreamin', dreamin' will see me through)
Woman you better believe that I'm
Dreamin' you into my life
5:00 still walkin' around
I call you up but you just bring me down
I guess you'd say I'm gettin' nowhere
But in my dreams you always come around
Here am I, I'm takin' a chance
Walkin' on air, flyin' so high
Here am I, I'm facin' the truth
There's no other way I'll ever make you mine

Woman, you got to believe me woman
Oh woman, you got to believe me woman

You got to believe me woman

 You know I need someone
Someone I can call my own
You know I need somebody, need somebody
'Cause I don't want to be alone
Every night I hope and pray a dream lover will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms and know the magic of her charms
'cause I want a girl to call my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
Dream lover, where are you with a love, oh, so true?
And I hand that can hold, to feel you near as I grow old?
'cause I want a girl to call my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
Well, someday, I don't know how, I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way, and I don't know how, she'll bring her love to me
Dream lover, until then, I'll go to sleep and dream again
That's the only thing to do, till my lover's dreams come true
'cause I want a girl (a girl) to call (to call) my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
'cause I want a girl (a girl) to call (to call) my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
Please don't make me dream alone
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone
Don't make me dream alone
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone




 I shall think it a dream tomorrow
I won't believe you returned
That once again I saw and touched you
And you're so unconserned, unconcerned
You must have known that your cruel silence
Would be so hard to bear
And yet you let me wait, you let me wait and
Wonder
Neither here nor there, here nor there
I came back with just one intention
For one last look, one last taste of you
Revenge on those who still despise me
And take my own life too
But there's a long and twisted journey
Between this callous thought and deed
And you're a sweeter way to give me
All the things I need
Two ambitions coincidind
Will only happen now and then
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again
How I hope it's no dream tomorrow
But I'm scared the light will fade
And today will be a vague recollection
Just a fool's escapade, escapade
I never cared much about the future
Yesterday was always there
So when you give me hope, hope or a promise
It just isn't fair, isn't fair
Any plan, any calculation
Any plot or device at all
Runs into another's dream
Runs into a wall
No matter what premeditation
In our three score years and ten
There are only fractured moments
We'd want to live again
Two ambitions coinciding
Will only happen now and then
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore your faith again
Never hope or dream tomorrow
Will restore you faith again




 Well send me love in a package labelled dynamite
I wanna feel an explosion when I hold you tight
I got a powerhouse reception waiting for you
When you come back to your loving baby's arms again
Come back I'm dynamite
Come back I'm dynamite
Well give me kisses that explode before my very eyes
I know the sight of you could generate a million sighs
I'm all set for detonation baby don't you know
Three two one zero there I go
I'm dynamite
I'm dynamite set to explode
Come back I'm dynamite
Come back I'm dynamite
Sail across the stars and to a silvery moon
If you wanna know what heaven's like you'll be there soon
Come back I'm dynamite
Come back I'm dynamite
Well give me kisses that explode before my very eyes
I know the sight of you could generate a million sighs
I'm all set for detonation baby don't you know
Three two one zero there I go
Come back come back 'cos I'm dynamite to be with
Come back to your loving baby's arms again
Come back I'm dynamite
Come back I'm dynamite
Sail across the stars and to a silvery moon
If you wanna know what heaven's like you'll be there soon
Come back I'm a time bomb
Come back my fuse is lit
Come back I'm dynamite
Come back if you don't come back to me
Come back I'm going to self-destruct
Come back I'm dynamite




 Nothing can be permanent
Nothing set in stone
Never try to fool yourself
That you are not alone
Know your place don't chance your arm
Your secrets are all known
Never cross the great divide
Each to his own
Don't misunderstand me, don't be hurt, don't take offence
But what I am about to tell you makes a lot of sense
I've been more than happy with you, loved you as you are
But being happy only takes a restless heart so far
Be thankful for the past but know those times won't come again
I found you quite diverting, even tender now and then
Remember I will always be the first to sing your praise
But I must close the book on our adolescent days
Nothing can be permanent
Nothing set in stone
Never try to fool yourself
That you are not alone
Know your place don't chance your arm
Your secrets are all known
Never cross the great divide
Each to his own
Did you really think we'd never drift apart?
That we'd decay together in some endless heart to heart
Did you never realise that we are not the same?
We are made what we are made - you are not to blame
Nothing can be permanent
Nothing set in stone
Never try to fool yourself
That you are not alone
Know your place don't chance your arm
Your secrets are all known
Never cross the great divide
Each to his own




 Evening is the time of day
I find nothing much to say
Don't know what to do
But I come to
When it's early in the morning
Over by the windows day is dawning
When I feel the air
I feel that life is very good to me, you know
In the sun there's so much yellow
Something in the early morning meadow
Tells me that today you're on your way
And you'll be coming home, home to me
Night time isn't clear to me
I find nothing near to me
Don't know what to do
But I come to
When it's early in the morning
Very, very early without warning
I can feel a newly born vibration
Sneaking up on me again
There's a songbird on my pillow
I can see the fun in weeping willow
I can see the sun
You're on your way
You'll be coming home
When it's early in the morning
Over by the windows day is dawning
When I feel the air
I feel that life is very good to me, you know
In the sun there's so much yellow
Something in the early morning meadow
Tells me that today you're on your way
And you'll be coming home
When it's early in the morning
Very, very early without warning
I can feel a newly born vibration
Sneaking up on me again...




 Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!
Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!
I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you!
Don't be a naughty baby
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!




 It was three o'clock in the afternoon, we were in a cafe
You ordered what you usually do
I looked in your eyes you looked down in that moment
What you couldn't say, baby I already knew
It's either you or me and I don't wanna be
The one who makes believe for too long
I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart
No, I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart
I gave all I had, everything I had needed you to give it back
Tell me was that too much to ask
Felt it on your lips, empty kisses, have a story all their own
How I wish it wasn't so
True love often dies and someone always tries
To keep it alive for too long
I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart
No, I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart
Lord, knows I've tried so hard standing in front of you
Knowing that this is goodbye
I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart
I don't wanna let you go
How can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart
I don't wanna be the one this time
I don't wanna watch us fall apart
Gonna have to leave it all behind
Even if it breaks my heart
No, I don't wanna watch us fade
But how can we remain the way we are
Guess I'll have to turn and walk away
Even if it breaks my heart
Even if it breaks my heart, oh no
Even if it breaks my heart
I gotta walk away
Yeah, yeah it's gonna break my heart




 Oh darling, will our love be like an evergreen tree
Stay ever green and young as the seasons go
Your kisses could make love grow like an evergreen tree
Bloom in the summer's sun and the winter's snow
On every branch will blossom, dreams for me and you
Our tree of love will stay ever green, if our hearts stay ever true
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree
On every branch will blossom, dreams for me and you
Our tree of love will stay ever green, if our hearts stay ever true
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree
On the evergreen tree, on the evergreen tree




 Everybody needs to cry some
Everybody can't be wise
Everybody needs some understanding
Understanding when you cry
Everybody knows
Love doesn't always begin like this
Everybody knows
Love doesn't always end with a kiss
See I've been in love and I know
And now you've been in love and you know
Anyone who's ever hurt you
Anyone who's ever tried
Will only love you then desert you
Won't believe you when you cry
Everybody knows
Love doesn't always begin like this
Everybody knows
Love doesn't always end with a kiss
See I've been in love and I know
And now you've been in love and you know
(Guitar Solo)
Everybody knows
Love doesn't always begin like this
Everybody knows
Love doesn't always end with a kiss
See I've been in love and I know

And now you've been in love and you know
Everybody needs to cry some
Everybody can't be wise
Everybody needs some understanding
Understanding when you cry
Everybody knows
Love doesn't always end like this




 Look at the man in the corner, he's sitting all alone
His blankets are made out of cardboard
And his pillows are made out of stone
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie
See the man walking on the water, see the light in his eyes
He came into the world with a message to tell
He came into the world to die
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie
You're always telling stories, you're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories, why?
So think of yourself in the water, seeing your days flashing by
It's too late to see what you wanted to be
You've spent all your time, you must die
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie
Every face tells a story it never tells a lie, oh
You're always telling stories, you're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories, why?
Why don't you step down
And make it work out right
I'm trying to get to you with my warning
Been here
For nearly half the night
Look it's nearly four in the morning.......

 Well I always knew, I was crazy for you
But now I know you’d thrill me so?
If this is love, well it’s fabulous
Your lips close to mine, I get chills up my spine
And when we touch, I thrill so much
If this is love, well it’s fabulous
I read in a book about love and it’s charms
But I, I never knew until I held you in my arms
When I held you tight, I know, I know I am right
Cause only you can do what you do
If this is love, well it’s fabulous
Well I always knew, I was crazy for you
But now I know you’d thrill me so?
If this is love, well it’s fabulous
I read in a book about love and it’s charms
But I, I never knew until I held you in my arms
When I held you tight, I know, I know I am right
Cause only you can do what you do
If this is love, well it’s fabulous
If this is love, it’s fabulous
If this is love, well it’s fabulous




 I find now hope within to call my own
For I am frail of heart, my strength is gone
Here in the comfort of the faithful One
I walk a narrow road through valleys deep
In search of higher ground on mountains steep
And with feet unsure I still keep pressing on
For I am guided by the faithful One
I see your wounded hands, I touch your side
With thorns upon your brow you bled and died
But there's an empty tomb, a love for all who come
And give their hearts to You, the faithful One
Faithful, faithful to the end
My true and precious friend
You have been faithful, faithful
So faithful to me
And from the starry sky there shines on me
An everlasting hope of liberty
And when the day is done and when the race is run
I will bow down before God's only Son
And I will lift my hands in praise for all You've done
And I will worship You my faithful One




 Me and my baby we're just going round
Not getting on luv,not puting it down
We had the kind of sweet affair
We both felt we needed
No psychic fusion,just a steady date
No grand illusions of the romantic fates
She looked for her,I looked for me
Don't know why we conceded
CHORUS:
'Cos we were high,now we're low
Tell me why did we go
Falling in luv
Falling in luv
Under pressure from family and friends
They seem to treasure a storybook end
One look at them I realise luv is real overated
CHORUS Repeated




 Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with you
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with you
Fallin in love again, fallin in love again
Why couldn't I, why shouldn't I fall in love with you
Why must you lead your heart and keep we two apart
Why couldn't I, why shouldn't I fall in love with you
Mm mm, mm mm
Don't tell me, I know
Its late, our date
Is almost over, its time to go
Please, give me one more chance, this is my first romance
Why couldn't I, why shouldn't I fall in love with you
(Fall, Fall, Fall)
Mm mm, mm mm
Don't tell me, I know
Its late, our date
Is almost over, its time to go
Please, give me one more chance, this is my first romance
Why couldn't I, why shouldn't I fall in love with you
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with you
Fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with you




 When I was young I took an oath
To fight for love and faith and hope
But how was I to have known
I would have to face myself, my cover blown
Yeah I was shaken by what I saw
Something in you breaks when you watch your comrades fall
Even now I suppose the battle's not yet over
And I'm just another soldier
On the field of love
Marching blind through the dark
Somehow it fell on me to lead the charge
I was wounded, I bear the scar
And wear it like a badge of courage on my heart
So sound the bugle and beat the drums
The sky has turned blood-red at the setting of the sun
Even now, heaven knows, the battle's not yet over
And I'm just another soldier
On the field of love
Should I go down on this hallowed ground
Surely more of us are willing to try for love
Willing to die
So sound the bugle and beat the drums
The night is coming on at the sinking of the sun
Even now I suppose the battle's never over
As long as there's a soldier
On the field of love




 My eyes may see the coming King in all His majesty
In company all dressed in white
But meanwhile here at the world's dark end
The dragon draws the iron curtain round against the Light
And souls grow weary in this war of Love
And seek their solace strolling down sweet civilian ways
But meanwhile back at the world's dark end
The nations see no future waiting for the serpent to strike
Where have all the Christian soldiers gone
Where is the resistance, will no-one be strong
When will we stand up tall and straight
Rise up and storm the gate
How can we fail to get excited
The battle is ours why don't we fight it
Battalions of darkness rise above me
But God put a fighter in me, put a fighter in me
We will sing songs of victory
We will arise and set men free
We will applaud Your Majesty
We will proclaim Your Kingdom come
We will announce the battle done
We will lift up the Righteous One
I could talk for hours but you wouldn't hear a word
Your own opinions make you blind
There will come a morning when the sand has all run out
And there will be no time to change your mind
Like a thief in the night He will come
There will be nowhere left you can run
You can fall with the night, or you can rise
With the Sun
Like a thief in the night He will come
There will be nowhere left you can run
You can fall with the night, or you can rise
With the Sun




 Whatever happened
To the teenage romance
Is it hidden in a tacky magazine
Everybody's talking
Saying trash is neat
You think it's good fun
But it's never that free
Who is the man of the moment
Does his image stand ten feet tall
Or is he just a cardboard hero
Staring down at you from your wall
You can dream but you can't touch
You can dream but not too much
You can dream but you can't touch
You can dream but not too much
Friday night
Out on the town
It's a special date
First time around
You read all about the story book romance
He stands there waiting
And you want to hold his hand
Saturday
You're broken down
Your heart is lying somewhere
Is it lost or found
You can dream but you can't touch
You can dream but not too much
You can dream but you can't touch
If this is love it's not enough
You can dream but you can't touch
You can dream but not too much
You can dream but you can't touch
You want a love that costs too much
You can dream but you can't touch
If this is love it's not enough
You can dream of tender touch
Don't let your heart be lost to love




 Lonely guy, tears are falling
Can’t you hear, my heart is calling
I just had my first lesson in love
Such should be ever true
Turn right ‘round and sit we’re through
I just had my first lesson in love
People say that love’s for fools
And I agree
For my first lesson
In turn out for me
Maybe someday I’ll find out
What this love game all about
But I just had my first lesson in love
People say that love’s for fools
And I agree
For my first lesson
In turn out for me
Maybe someday I’ll find out
What this love game all about
But I just had my first lesson in love
My first lesson in love
My first lesson in love
My first lesson in love




 When the weather is fine
And the clouds have gone by
I go up in the air
Waving people goodbye
In my flying machine
I go up, I go down, I go round and round
I can race with the birds
I can fight with the wind
I can fly on my head
I can dance in a spin
In my flying machine
I go up, I go down, I go round and round and round
People on the ground
They gathered all around to admire
There's a feeling inside me
That gives me the urge to go higher
Well, I know what goes up
Will eventually fall
So I won't take no chances
While I'm having a ball
In my flying machine
I go up, I go down, I go round and round and round and round
Higher and higher!
People on the ground
They gathered all around to admire
There's a feeling inside me
That gives me the urge to go higher,aaahhh
But I know what goes up
Will eventually fall
So I won't take no chances
While I'm having a ball
In my flying machine
I go up, I go down, I go round and round and round and round, yeah
Higher and higher!
Higher and higher!
Higher and higher!




 Poet of the music many words
To say a simple thing
But it takes thought and time and rhyme
To make a poem sing
With music and words I’ve been playing
For you I’ve written a song
To be sure that you know what I’m saying
I translate as I go along
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among those stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, umm kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing for ever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you




 I am not the only one
Who can see that you are beautiful
But I am the only one
Who can see you belong to me
Making me feel so light
Making me feel such powerful emotion
Making my heart so light
All the time
Something in the air tonight
Something in the air with powerful emotion
Something in the air so right
Feels so right
Ooo together in love
Ooo forever in love
Ooo together we are
Forever you will be mine
Filling my life with love
Filling my life with powerful emotion
Filling my life with love
All the time
I am not the only one
Who can see that you are beautiful
But I am the only one
Who can see you belong to me
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Mmm
Ooo together in love
Ooo forever in love
Ooo together we are
Forever you will be mine
Together we are
Forever you will be mine
I am not the only one
Who can see that you are beautiful
But I am the only one
Who can see you belong to me
Something in the air tonight
Something in the air with powerful emotion
Something in the air so right
Feels so right
Ooo together in love
Ooo forever in love
Ooo together we are
Forever you will be mine




 Where do I start
How do I find
A way to explain how I'm feeling inside
These words could never be enough
To tell you just how much
I love you
With all that I am
And I need you
Please understand
From now on
Till the day that I die
You can be sure
That I'm in this love
For life
Dreams can come true
Just look at us
We've been given a chance from heaven above
With God's help we'll raise a family
And through the years you will see
I love you
More every day
I'll be with you every step of the way
From now on
Till the day that I die
You can be sure
That I'm in this love
For life
As the seasons change
Our love will remain strong
And I promise you
I promise you
I love you
More every day
I'll be with you
In the joy and the pain
From now on
Till the day that I die
You can be sure
That I'm in this love
For life
That I'm in this love
For life
That I'm in this love
For life

 Free
You refuse it
You don't choose it
Say it's no good for you
But it's free
And you don't take it
But you won't make it
Not until you do
A lot of things in life look fine
See them sparkle and shine
Take up most of your time
Time is flying
They're coming at you one by one
Never leave your dreams alone
Got to make them all your own
You can't stop trying
This is free
Coz you don't like it
You wanna fight it
Say it's no good for you
But it's free
And you don't take it
But you won't make it
Not until you do
Searching in the dead of night
Wondering if it's worth the fight
Wondering if I could be right
You say there's no way
Coz you've always been a self-made man
You got to make it while you can
Just another change of plan
Ah well maybe some day
This is free
Coz you don't like it
You wanna fight it
Say it's no good for you
But it's free
And you don't take it
But you won't make it
Not until you do
You won't make it
Not until you do
So come on take it
Coz you won't make it
Until you do




 From a distance, the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains so white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight
From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man
From a distance, we all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs and no disease
No hungry mouse to feed
From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They're is the songs of every man
God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us, from a distance
From a distance, you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance, I cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for
What we need is love and harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the song of every man




 You can't sleep and you just can't eat
Keep on moving around looking for her shadow
You've been through it once, well, we all should know
When you lie awake, it takes so long for the night to go
You gotta heartbreak
It's not the front page
You gotta heartbreak
But it's not the page, page news
Six lonely days you wonder when you'll wake
From these dreams of the past, well, there's no time like the present
You think right now, there can be no one else
You say first love is best, well, we all must learn to grow
You gotta heartbreak
It's not the front page
You gotta heartbreak
But it's not the page, page news, no, no
Don't rush love, you must take your time
Try to play it cool, got to read between the lines
If you don't she will fly away
To some far off place where she won't receive your telephone calls
You gotta heartbreak
It's not the front page
You gotta heartbreak
But it's not the page, page news
It's just a heartbreak
It's not the front page
You gotta heartbreak
But it's not the page, page news




 My love is turning
Like a wheel of fire she burns her way
My love is burning
She's a light to guide me through the fray
Galadriel, spirit of starlight
Eagle and dove gave birth to thee
Galadriel, spirit of starlight
You are my love and earth to me, my
Love and earth to me
My love is seeing
Through unabiased eyes she reads the signs
My love is searching
For new life somewhere she's bound to find
Galadriel, spirit of starlight
Eagle and dove give birth to thee
Galadriel, spirit of starlight
You are my love and earth to me
My love and earth to me




 Well, who's that a-walkin' down the street
Pickin' up those dainty little feet
Who's the one that catches my eye
Everytime she passes by - gee whizz it's you
Ever since we said goodbye, all because of a little white lie
Let me tell you why we parted, listen now to what my heart says
Chorus
Gee whizz it's you, you're the one that's makin' me blue
Gee whizz it's you, you're the one who can't be true
Little darlin' won't you hear my plea
Won't you please come back to me
We can pick up where we started, listen now to what my heart says
Ummmm - gee whizz it's you..........
(Instrumental)
Chorus
Little darlin' won't you hear my plea
Won't you please come back to me
We can pick up where we started, listen now to what my heart says
Ummmm - gee whizz it's you..........
Gee whizz it's you
Gee whizz it's you
(Fade Out)




 I love you so much, can't count all the ways
I'd die for you girl, and all they can say is
"he's not your kind"
They never get tired of puttin' me down
And i never know when i come around
What i'm gonna find
Don't let them make up your mind
Don't you know
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon you'll need a man
I've been misunderstood for all of my life
But what they're sayin', girl, just cuts like a knife
"the guy's no good"
Well, i finally found what i've been looking for
But if they get the chance, they'll end it for sure
Sure they would
Baby, i've done all i could
Now it's up to you
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon you'll need a man
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, but soon you'll need a man




 Well I can see - that you weren't givin' enough
That you weren't givin' as much as me
With all your small talk - bendin' the rules
Are you runnin' before you can walk
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found
Too much too soon too much too soon
Too much too soon
Well can you get excited by what you see
You've been takin' my love
You should be giving it back to me
Give a little bit of love like you did before
Give a little bit more (give a little bit more)
Give a little bit more (like you did before)
Give a little bit more
In a photograph you didn't put me in the picture
My lovin' just made you laugh I was wide eyed
Taken right in I can't understand why you lied
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found
Too much too soon too much too soon
Too much too soon
Well can you get excited by what you see
You've been taking my love
You should be giving it back to me
Give a little bit of love like you did before
Give a little bit more (give a little bit more)
Give a little bit more (like you did before)
Give a little bit more
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found
Too much too soon too much too soon
Too much too soon
Well can you get excited by what you see
You've been taking my love
You should be giving it back to me
Give a little bit of love like you did before
Give a little bit more (give a little bit more)
Give a little bit more
(like you did before)
Give a little bit more




 Got every reason to feel like I do
From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes
Cause last night my baby took the weight off my mind
Told me everything was gonna be fine
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outa sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way
She could have resisted my efforts to pry
But she knows how I feel and she's not exactly shy
Though right now I'm lonely I know it won't be long
I can hear the train comin' bringin' lovin' along
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outa sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way
Ooh I used to be so lost and confused
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried
But still I didn't rest I had to know
What was behind it all I'd come so far
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote
I couldn't resist it being beside her
Could have held that moment forever in my heart
The moment I saw her was the moment I knew
That her love is my life and her light's shining through
She said she loved me
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me
Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outa sight
Give me, give me, give me love your way
Ooh I used to be so lost and confused
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried
But still I didn't rest I had to know
What was behind it all I'd come so far
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote




 God rest ye, merry gentlemen, let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy
From God our heav'nly Father a blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born the son of God by name
"Fear not, then," said the angel, "Let nothing you afright
This day is born a Savior of a pure Virgin bright
To free all those who trust in Him from Satan's power and might."
The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethl'em straightaway this blessed Babe to find
But when to Bethlehem they came whereat this Infant lay
They found Him in a manger where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray
Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace;
This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface
God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign
And many a merry Christmas may live to see again;
Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near--
That God send you a happy new year, happy new year
And God send you a happy new year

 Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like a ball. 
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call
From the early, early morning till the early, early night
You can see Miss Molly rocking at the house of blue lights
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call
Well, now momma, poppa told me: "Son, you better watch your step
"If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my dad myself
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call
I am going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me if it's a nineteen carat golden thing
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball. 
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call

 Searching for a green light
Looking for it all night
Using all my keen sight
Searching for a green light
From just this side of midnight
'Til dawn breaks into daylight
Keepin' myself out of sight
Searching for a green light
Well I've heard this story before
But that doesn't stop me searching
It's been so long since you gave me a sign
A sign to stop my head turning
But all I have are just your old memories
But you know baby, baby that's fine
Cos I'm spending all of my time
Searching for a green light
Looking for it all night
Using all my keen sight
Searching for a green light
From just this side of midnight
'Til dawn breaks into daylight
Keepin' myself out of sight
Searching for green light
Lookin' around
But all I have are your old memories
But you know baby baby that's fine
Cos I'm spending all of my time
Searching for a green light
Looking for it all night
Using all my keen sight
Searching for a green light
Searching for a green light
From just this of midnight etc....




 This huddling in my coat, this gypsy bundle
In Liverpool, in squalor cast adrift
A dirty ragged mess of desperation
Though devil-touched I took as God's gift
No history, no owner, no rhyme, no reason
Nor explanation of his sorry state
And yet with all the fire of the survivor
I couldn't leave it
I couldn't leave it to it's fate
What are we to do with it?
Dirty, ragged, coloured breed
Welcome it with open arms?
Welcome one more mouth to feed?
Could your own blood not provide you
With the gratitude you need?
We will call the boy Heathcliff!
And every man on earth conceals a secret
On which he feeds and yet tears him apart
And in this child so great that complication
Will surely destroy the strongest heart
And as you fall into the traps he sets you
And as you're drawn to cross his reckless line
And as I watch you peer into his darkness
I pray you'll never search
I pray you'll never search for mine
What are we to do with it?
Dirty, ragged, coloured breed
Welcome it with open arms?
Welcome one more mouth to feed?
Could your own blood not provide you
With the gratitude you need?
We will call the boy Heathcliff!




 Had to be
No escape, no room for doubt
No way out
Seeing you, it was easy to decide
Cut and dried
Had to be
Now we know why we exist
Don't resist, don't even think at all
Simply fall
In love
This is what
Had to be
She was easy to seduce
Let her loose
In a world where the fake and shallow shine
She'll be fine
Had to be
She's a woman, nothing more
Falling for whatever comes along
She's so wrong
A fool
To herself
Had to be
Don't ever tell me
How to live my life, tell me who I should love
No don't ever tell me
What to say or do in the life I will share with you
Had to be (No-one can tell me)
For we get what we deserve (How I should live
My life)
Lose your nerve (No-one can tell me)
And fates hustle in and take control (or take
Control)
Of your soul
Had to be
But the spark of hope remains
And sustains the echo of a smile
For a while (No-one can tell me)
We're fools
To ourselves - have to be (No-one has told me)
We're fools (It had to be)
To ourselves
Had to be




 Your sweet embrace, your hand in mine
So close together
How many times I've made you mine
Is this forever?
Promises and dreams we've shared
Do you remember?
Oh, here we are, so near and yet so far
From each other
Chorus:
Handle my heart with love
Don't let me hope in vain
Only your touch can save my heart
From breaking again
So handle my heart with love
Stay and you'll ease my pain
Only your touch can save my heart
From breaking again
Your gentle smile, your tender touch
So captivating
No other love has meant this much
And I'll go on waiting
One day in your arms I'll hear
This is forever
I know it's there, though right now it's hard to care
For each other
Repeat chorus
Don't make us part
Please don't brake my heart again




 What can I say, she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do, still loving you
It's all a dream
How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
What can I do, she's saying we're through
With how it was
What will I try, I still don't see why
She says what she does
How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
What can I say, she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do, still loving you
It's all a dream
How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
How can we hang on to a dream
What can I say, she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do, still loving you
It's all a dream
How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
How can we hang on to a dream




 Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
For the morning sun and all its glory
Greets the day with hope and comfort too
You fill my life with laughter, somehow make it better
Ease my troubles that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, oh, to the one
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
There's a love that's divine
And it's yours and it's mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, oh, to the one
Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Oh, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles that's what you do
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Have I told you lately that I love you?
C'mon baby move with me
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby




 Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were dear to us
Will be near to us once more
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who were dear to us
Will be near to us once more
Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now




 Hey my friend, I know too well
The pressures in this life are real
You gotta come out fighting when they ring your bell
Stand up for the way you feel
You can't let it get you down
You can't let it make you run away
Got to keep your dreams alive
We can do it, but we'll only make it work together
When it all comes down to the push and shove
We can make it through, we can rise above
'Cause you know that we've got the power of
Healin' love, talkin' 'bout healin' love
Now I can see that you're feeling sad
Some one's chosen your heart to steal
Hey, my friend, you can take my hand
And I'll show your heart a power that's real
It will never let you down
It will always open any door
So pick the pieces off the ground
Because you may have lost the battle but we'll win this war
When it all comes down to the push and shove
We can make it through, we can rise above
'Cause you know that we've got the power of
Healin' love, talkin' 'bout healin' love
So wipe away your tears, you can put away your gun
And get ready to receive the strongest medicine
When it all comes down to the push and shove
We can make it through, we can rise above
'Cause you know that we've got the power of
Healin' love, talkin' 'bout healin' love

 She wears her hair real wild
Her nails are perfectly filed
Her lips painted deep jungle red
Her best colour is black
And the clothes on her back
Show she's a woman with style
She wears satin and lace with impeccable taste
She'll tell you it runs in her blood
In a cloud of perfume she walks into the room
And it comes to a stop when she does
She's a heart user
No time for losers
She'll use you up and throw your love away
Heart user
A barracuda
She'll use you just don't get in her way
Oozing with charm got a girl on each arm
His eyes match his all over tan
And as he straightens his tie
Some beauty catches his eye
Brings out the best in the man
And her fresh young face makes his cold heart race
She's wearing that deadly perfume
You must admire the skill as he comes in for the kill
It's time to attack make his move
He's a heart user
No time for losers
He'll use you up and throw your love away
Heart user
A barracuda
He'll use you just don't get in his way
Where you been all my life
This is love at first sight
Could swear we've met someone before
She throws back her head
And she shamelessly says
You got real good taste tell me more
Then the lady in black thinks she's setting her trap
And he thinks she's playing his game
But anybody can tell they're just into themselves
They're two of a kind they're the same
They're just heart users
No time for losers
They'll use you up and throw your love away
Heart users
They're barracuda
They'll use you just don't get in their way...




 Some fine day we'll live
Together, give together
One fine day
A time beyond our time
Come that day we'll make
It if we're strong
So help it along, help it along
Help it along
Please don't laugh at me
When I tell you
I believe in love
'cos it's still
The only thing that
There is too little of
And it's a long time coming
But come I'm sure it will
And just in time
The world will rhyme on
The far side of a hill
On some fine......
....... help it along




 Here comes summer
School is out, oh happy days
Here comes summer
Gonna grab my girl and run away
If she's willing
We'll go steady right away
Now let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Almost June, the sun is bright
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Gonna see her every night
It's the greatest (here comes summer)
Lots more time to hold her tight
Oh let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home
School's not so bad but the summer is better
They give me more time to see my girl
Walk through the park beneath the shiny moon
Oh when we kiss she makes my hair curl
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Feel her lips so close to mine
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
When we meet her eyes both shine
It's the greatest (here comes summer)
Let's have summer all the time
Oh let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
School is out, oh happy days
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Gonna grab my girl and run away
If she's willing (here comes summer)
We'll go steady right away
Oh let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Almost June, the sun is bright
Here comes summer (here comes summer)
Gonna see her every night
It's the greatest (here comes summer)
Lots more time to hold her tight
Oh let the sun shine bright on my happy summer home

 Josie's gone now
She cried a lot
Had to go away
And though I miss her
I want to kiss her
Ain't it just the way
But it's no way at all
'Cos if you knew what I'm goin'
Through you'd know
That there's one thing wrong
With the way I'm living
Ain't got no Josie no-more
Hey mr. dream maker send me a dream
This one is over it's not what it seamed
And so tonight when I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight, ooh
She didn't say much
Just a little touch
And she was on her way
Ooh I could have cried then
Instead I died then
She left me standing dazed
But it's no use crying
Well that's what everybody
Tells me and they all seem to know
That there's one thing wrong
With the way I'm living
Ain't got no Josie no-more
Hey mr. dream maker send me a dream
This one is over it's not what it seamed
And so tonight when I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight
Ooh, hey mr., ooh, hey mr
Hey mr. dream maker
Mr. dream maker send me a dream
This one is over it's not what it seamed
And so tonight when I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight
Aaahhh, send me a new dream tonight
Hey mr. dream maker send me a dream
This one is over it's not what it seamed
And so tonight when I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight
Aah, send me a new dream tonight.....




 Bye, bye, baby doll, I find you too high class
I bought myself a ticket, but you won't let me pass
This pink champagne and caviar are all very grand
But I prefer just rocking to a rock 'n' roll band
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
High Class Baby
High Class Baby
Well, go and find a rich man, put your arms around him
Tell him that you love him and go out and drown him
May be wich you're riches, you'll find true happiness
But I'll stay here a-rocking, 'cause it's what I love the best
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
High Class Baby
High Class Baby
Bye, bye, bye, bye, baby doll, I find you too high class
I bought myself a ticket, but you won't let me pass
This pink champagne and caviar are all very grand
But I prefer just rocking to a rock 'n' roll band
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoe
Honey, I soon lose the blues, bye bye, my baby
You've got sable mink and a Cadillac
Believe me honey, you're taking things too far
You can't find a true love with a sack of gold
Come on and love me, little honey, before you grow too old
In a joint that's a hoppin' and a cat that's a boppin'
There'll be no stoppin' me, wait and see
A lotta things I gotta do, go put on my dancing shoes
Honey, I soon lose the blues, wait until you hear the news
You're still my own true, my very own true
You're still my high class baby
(High class baby, high class baby) Baby, you're so high class
(High class baby, high class baby) Don't be mean to me, baby
(High class baby, high class baby) Baby, you're so high class
(High class baby, high class baby) Don't be mean, baby




 My heart has no desire to
Stay where doubts arise
And fears dismay
Though we must dwell
Where these are bound
I must go on to higher ground
I want to scale the
Utmost hight and catch
A gleam of glory bright
For faith has caught
The joyful sound
The song of life on higher ground
Lord, lift me up
And let me stand my feet
On heaven's stable land
Oh, greater plane
That I have found
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground
I'm treading on the
Upward way, new hights
I'm gaining every day
Still praying as I'm homeward bound:
Oh, plant my feet on higher ground




 Love show me the way when I am lost and hope begins
To fade
Love timeless and true whenever
I need strenght
I look to you
Tonight my faith is strong enough to see me through
Tonight you've got to trust in love the way I do
We gotta hold on tight-tonight
Hold on - nothing's gonna stop us if we just
Believe in love
Hold on - there's nothing under heaven we can't overcome-
Hold on
Now I see the way the tide'll turn and
The part I'll play
(It's) all part of a plan - you don't have to know
Or understand Tonight I'll see it all unfold before my eyes
Tonight - with fortune on my side and love to
Guide me
The future is looking bright - tonight
Hold on - nothings gonna stop us if we just
Believe in love
Hold on - there's nothing under heaven we can't
Overcome so hold on
And tho' the road ahead maybe unknown we'll
Make it if we hold on




 Nothing ever stays the same
Everything must change
Just take a look around you
You know it will astound you
History unfolding shows us
Good intentions pass
And a love once pledged in moonlight
Isn't guaranteed to last
Chorus:
(Only your love is constant baby)
(Only my love for you)
Only your love can hold us together
Only you - and everything you do
Just one kiss and my dreams come true
Only you - and everything you say
Only loving you - can make me feel this way
People who just play at love
Make loving something cheap
And it's only worth the playing if we
Play the game for keeps
The book of life has pages girl
That you and I must turn
And in every chapter in every story
Something there to learn
(Only your love is constant baby)
(Only my love for you)
Only your love can hold us together
Only you - and everything you do
Just one kiss and my dreams come true
Only you - and everything you say
Only loving you - can make me feel this way
People who just play at love
Make loving something cheap
And it's only worth the playing if we
Play the game for keeps
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is rarely ever blind
Take a look and you will find
That love is just caring
And sharing our loving together




 I'm sitting in the railway station
Got a ticket to my destination
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Ev'ry day's an endless stream
Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Tonight I'll sing my songs again
I'll play the game and pretend
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me
Homeward bound
I wish I was
Homeward bound
Home where my thought's escaping
Home where my music's playing
Home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me
Silently for me




 Ready steady gonna meet you on the ballroom floor
Brother Eddie quit your banging on my bathroom door
After shaving yeah and after three
I'm after having me some fun you see
I'm getting ready for the night to come
And here I come
Chorus:
I'm just a hot shot hitting town
(Have a little fun)
Just a hot shot getting down
(Ready steady run)
I'm just a hot shot looking around
(Loving on the run)
I'm having fun
Get the recognition each and every place I go
Fashion leader in the cuban heel and pointed toe
My Italian suit is pressed and clean
I'm the Latin lover of thelocal scene
I'm getting ready for the night to come
Chorus Repeated
A faded picture on the mantleshelf
My older brother looks like myself
Remember Donny dated Susie
And Susie rated Johnny
Johnny's into Susie
But Susie'a into Ronnie
Ronnie waits for Louie
But Louie's singing Louie-Lou-i
Chorus Repeated




 I'm gonna move into
A house without windows
So I'll never see you walking by
Walking by, with your new love
There in the darkness of
My house without windows
I won't have to see the stars that shine
Shine on you and your new love
I'd rather wander through an endless night
Than face the light of another lonely day
Knowing that you won't be there
There to share these two arms ever again
I'll take my broken heart
And I'll take all my broken dreams
And from now on you will find me there
Crying there, trying to forget
That you no longer want me
That you no longer need me
That you've gone and left me
Left me here all alone
In my house without windows
In my house without windows, without windows
And without love
In my house without windows
In my house without windows
And without love




 Another town I've never heard of
Another 5 am motel
Another wordless conversation
Between a memory and myself
One night I just started driving
Now I've been driving seven days
I could tell myself I'm gone
But I just can't get away
I left her there
Slipped out while she was sleeping
I left her there
Like a ghost I disappeared
I didn't even know where I was going
So how did she get here
Oh how did she get here
I choose my exit signs at random
I never travel one straight line
I should be so damn had to follow
But she's waiting every time
One of these days
I'm bound to find a town
Where she won't turn up
Every time I turn around




 How wonderful to know you really love me
How wonderful to know you really care
How beautiful to feel my arms around you
Kissing your eyes
Hearing your sighs
Touching your hair
How wonderful to know sunshine and laughter
That fills my empty heart with love divine
To share this life with you now and hereafter
How wonderful to know that you are mine
To share this life with you now and hereafter
How wonderful to know that you are mine




 No one on earth means more to me
Your painted pictures are the way that the world
Should be
Don't ever change it, I don't wanna live in this
World without you
Oh no
I can't explain, I can't define
What you do to me, but my senses are so alive
You tell your story and it's all that I ever believe
Portraits and poetry are frozen forms of perfection
But they don't live and breathe
When my heart's in need they don't answer me
You - ooo oooh you are, you're a human work of art
Walking, talking inspiration
You - ooo oooh you are, you're a human work of art
You make me love, you make me care
You give me freedom I don't need when I know
You're there
My search is over I've got all of the riches that
Money don't buy, Oh no
Your words are poetry and your face is more than
Perfection
The way I watch you move it only goes to prove
In everything to do
You - oooh oooh you are, you're a human work of art
Walking, talking inspiration
You - ooooh ooh you are, you're a human work of art
You're my mission
You're my goal
Oooh you liberate my soul
There's no illusion, that your touch is gold
Portraits and poetry are frozen forms of perfection
The way I watch you move it only goes to prove
In everything you do
You - oooh oooh you are, you're a human work of art
Walking, talking new sensation
You - ooooh oooh you are, you're a human work of art
Walking, talking inspiration




 Got no time to stop to speak to friends passing by
Got no strength to wipe away the tears from my eyes
I don't care what's going on
Only know she's gone
The sun don't shine anymore
And I don't feel fine anymore
She ain't mine anymore
No, I don't feel fine anymore
I ain't got time anymore
Seems to be such sadness in each place I go
The people laugh and still I just wouldn't know
Never stop to see who's there
Once I used to care
But the sun don't shine anymore
I don't feel fine anymore
She ain't mine anymore
No, I don't feel fine anymore
I ain't got time anymore
I can't get used to being left on my own
It takes up all the time just trying to be alone
Used to take an interest in the state of affairs
Now I only know how much I'm missing that girl
Hope the world will understand I can't lend a hand
'Cause she ain't mine anymore
I don't feel fine anymore
She ain't mine anymore
No, I don't feel fine anymore
Ain't got time anymore
She ain't mine anymore
I don't feel fine anymore
Ain't got time anymore
She ain't mine anymore
No, I don't feel fine anymore




 Now I never seem to get the message
That is something I could never do
I could never be the one to hurt you
I'm just trying to make the whole life through
You live inside me
You caused me sorrow
And I should forgive you everything
No matter how far you fly
To the moon and back
And back again and back again
I cannot give you my love
And we are oceans apart
But I follow my heart
And there is nothing, nothing
That I would rather be
But I understand you
You got to be free
You and me
So fly away butterfly
Take it to your journey's end
You are here today and gone tomorrow
But I will always be your friend
Blessed are the souls who love each other
And I will never let the story die
And I vow to give you everything
I cannot give you my love
No matter how much you pray
Everything you say and do
Send me away
Always be in your world
For what your world is to you
To the moon and back and back again
(and back again and back again)
I cannot give you my love but I do
And though the oceans will roar
You will find me no more
There is no-one, no-one that I would rather see
But I understand you
So fly away butterfly
Fly away
To the moon and back and back again
(and back again and back again)
Fly away




 Now I never seem to get the message

No matter how much you cry
Everything you say and do
Feel like a lie
Always be in your world
No matter how far you fly
To the moon and back
And back again and back again

And we are oceans apart but I follow my heart
There is nothing, nothing that I would rather be
I understand you, you got to be free, you and me
So fly away butterfly
Take it to your journey's end
You are here today and gone tomorrow
But I will always be your friend
Blessed are the souls who love each other
And I will never let the story die
And I vow to give you everything
I cannot give you my love
No matter how much you pray
Everything you say and do

I cannot give you my love
No matter how much you cry
Everything you say and do
Feel like a lie
Always be in your world
No matter how you fly
To the moon and back and back again
And back again and back again
I cannot give you my love but I'd try
So fly away butterfly
Fly away, fly away
Fly away butterfly




 You could have been a bad girl
And wasted all my time
You could have got me mad girl
And made me lose my mind
But you did what you have to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you
It makes me very proud baby
To know that you're my girl
I want to say it loud baby
I want to tell the world
That you did what you had to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you
I've got everything a man could need
Oh I feel just like a slave that has been freed
I won't cry myself to sleep no more
'Cause I've found the love that I've been looking for
Now I don't have a problem
'Cause I know who I am
You see I lost my only problem
When you made me your man
'Cause you did what you had to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you




 Ich traeume deine treeume, ich bin allein wie du
Ich traeume deine traeume, und finde keine ruh'
Da bist du bei mir im zimmer
Und ich fuehle immer wieder, wie schoen deine liebe waer'
Ich traeume deine traeume, doch einmal sind sie wahr
Und das wird wunderbar
Und ich sage deinen namen
Worte, die erst sinn bekamen, seitdem es dich fuer mich gibt
Ich traeume deine traeume, doch einmal sind sie wahr
Und das wird wunderbar




 If you should tell me that I'll always be
The one you'll always love so true
Then I can tell you I could easily
I could easily fall in love with you
It wasn't long ago I saw you there
But even then I thought I knew
That given half a chance I'd easily
I could easily fall in love with you
I've been too long on my ownsome now
I've been too long by myself
I couldn't feel more lonesome now
If I was left on the shelf
Don't ever change that smile you're smiling now
And please don't let me see you blue
Then I can tell you, oh, so easily
I could easily fall in love with you
I've been too long on my ownsome now
I've been too long by myself
I couldn't feel more lonesome now
If I was left on the shelf
Don't ever change that smile you're smiling now
And please don't let me see you blue
Then I can tell you, oh, so easily
I could easily fall in love with you




 I didn't know what time it was
Till I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what day it was
You hold my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm yours alone
I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what day it was
Then you hold my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand
Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own
I didn't know what year it was
Live was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes
I'm wise
And I know what time it is now
I'm wise
And I know what time it is now
I'm so wise
And I know what time it is now




 I do not love youisabella
I never have I never will
I saunter through this ceremony
Confidence high, enthusiasm nil
My reasoning need not detain you
But woman it's not all bad news
Very few find peace and succour
In the spouse or life that they choose
He will crush you
Has no pity
Wave on wave on wave of grief
I shall love him
Understand him
That he loves me is my belief
I do not need you Isabella
If I did we'd not be here
We'd be in some lovers' heaven
Our way ahead and dreams so clear
I welcome you into my family
Into it's dark internal wars
Let me enter into battle
I have the will I have the cause
No-one leaves him
But they're damaged
And stripped of every vestige of good
Is he man or
Is he devil?
I see but dread the likelihood
I shall not stay poor Isabella
So never heed my marriage vow
Believe in time you won't regret this
Thought it may disturb you now
Abandon all attempts to love me
Don't fool yourself that's what you feel
When you at last decide to hate me
At least your emotion will be real
Wolfish, savage
Tuned to madness
Love is stifled, joy denied
I do hate him
I am wretched
A cold contaminated bride
Isabella! Isabella!
I do not love you Isabella
I never have I never will
I saunter through this ceremony
Confidence high, enthusiasm nil
My reasoning need not detain you
But woman it's not all bad news
Very few find peace and succour
In the spouse or life that they choose
Isabella!
Isabella!




 What do I do
We've already said our last goodbyes
But I'm missing you
And I don't want our love to die
I wrote me a song
To tell the whole wide world
About what went wrong
When I didn't have a single doubt
It left me so confused
I don't know where to turn
'cause living without you, it hurts
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna let you go
I could never let myself
Fall in love with someone else
Waiting in the pouring rain
Crying for your love again
'cause I don't know what else to do
I don't wanna lose you
All my friends
They tell me it's time for moving on
No more pretence
Someone will surely come along
But how can I believe
In every word they say
They'll never know how much
How much you mean to me




 I don't wanna dream about you
Every single night
I don't wanna get all shook up
When I hold you tight
I don't wanna settle down
I'm just ain't ready to
I don't wanna love you
But I do
I don't wanna count the hours
'Til you're by my side
And I don't wanna get so jealous
I forget my pride
I don't want this heart of mine
To be so doggone true
I don't wanna love you
But I do
Now I made up my mind
To stay as free as can be
But no matter how I fight it
You've got something that gets me, yeah
I don't want my world to crumble
When I make you mad
I don't wanna feel like cryin'
Everytime you're sad
But no matter what I want
I can't stop wanting you
I don't wanna love you
But I do
I don't want my world to crumble
When I make you mad
I don't wanna feel like cryin'
Everytime you're sad
But no matter what I want
I can't stop wanting you
I don't wanna love you
But I do
I don't wanna love you




 If you walked away from me today
I am sure that who you were going to
Would feel the way as I do
Baby it's you who fills up my life
And if you walked away from me today
It wouldn't change a thing
I'd still be singin' celebration of you
Baby, you do, you fill up my life
You my life'til now
No one's been able to show me how
To fill my life like you
You are the woman who taught me to
And if you walked away from me today
Never to retur until the journey that you made had ended
I know you planned it just to fill up my life
You my life,now I know what it feels like to overflow
Until my life is through
A'll I'm here for,is here for you,just for you
Only for you




 Yeah, I got a feeling
That I'm gonna get you
Say, I got a little feeling
That it won't be long
I hold you in my arms and baby
That's where you belong
Say, I got a feeling
You think about me
Well, I got feeling
And I hope it's true
'Cause nobody else could want you so
And love you like I do
Well, I got a feeling that our love
Was meant to be... oh, yeah
Well it had a big wild world of happiness
Just waiting for you and me
So why don't you tell me
You love me only?
'Cause I got a feeling
Too really do, really do
And I never had this feeling
'Til I fell in love with you, yeah
. . . . . 
Well, I got a feeling that our love

Too really do, really do
And I never had this feeling
'Til I fell in love with you
'Til I fell in love with you
'Til I fell in love with you

 Get up in the mornin' feelin' MIGHTY weak
A tossin' and a turnin' well, I had ain't no sleep
Oh baby, what road's our love taking?
To romance or heartbreaking'
Won't you say which way you're gonna go
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
Nine and nine make fourteen, four and four make nine
The clock is strikin' thirteen I think I lost my mind
You know it's gettin' aggravatin'
How long can I keep waitin'
Tell me if you love me yes or no
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
Oh, how much I need you
Have pity on this heart of mine
Well, if you need and want me too
I'll be your one and only till the end of time
Saw the fortune teller, had my fortune read
She sent me to the doctor, who sent me straight to bed
He said I'm lonesome and I'm lovesick
I've got my mind on lipstick
Will you kiss away my cares and woe?
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know




 Love had ended
Can't be mended
All along the line
I've been true to you
Even though for some time
I knew we were through
I was feeling
That love had ended
Can't be mended
But I can't bear to see you cry
The feeling's gone
It's been missing too long
But I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
It's such a shame
That it's ended this way
But I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
There'll be no goodbyes
There are no words to say
When you realise
That I'm far away
You'll be hurting
Like I've been hurting
The truth was burning
But I just can't say goodbye
The feeling's gone
It's been missing too long
But I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
It's such a shame
That it's ended this way
But I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
Ooh but I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
If I stopped to think about
The good times that we shared
I could fool myself believing
That somehow love, love was still there
Ooh (love, love, love, love, love had ended)
(love, love, love, love, love had ended)
I was feeling
That love had ended
Can't be mended
But I can't bear to see you cry
(repeat chorus)




 I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you
Ooh-ooh
Love to you
All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing for you to do
But keep me making love to you
Love to you
Ooh-ooh
Love to you
CHORUS and I can tell by the way
That you walk that walk
I can hear by the way
You talk that talk
And I can know by the way
You treat your girl
That I could give you all the loving
In the whole wide world
All I want to do is bake your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you
CHORUS
All I want to do is bake your bread
Just to make sure you're well fed
I don't want you sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you
Ooh-ooh
Love to you
Ooh-ooh
Love to you




 You know, if you break my heart I’ll go
But I’ll be back again
‘Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so
I’m the one who wants you
Yes, I’m the one who wants you
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I’m
Not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I run away from you
That you would want me to
But I got a big surprise
Though you, if you break my heart I’ll go
But I’ll be back again




 'Love is being friends,' she says
'Going on and on' she says
'True love never ends,' she says
'I don't believe a word'
She says, 'I don't believe a word'
'Love is now for me,' I say
True love needn't come to stay
It can come and slip away
Believe me when I say
That love is strictly for today
Love is many things to many people
I just know what it means to me
Love is 'tie me down' to many people
For me, if it's right, then it's got to be free
I can't look ahead to say
Tomorrow I'll still feel this way
Who knows what games we both might play?
But this I'm gonna say 'I'll love you forever Today'
On and on today, Never ending today
I'll love you forever today




 Im looking out the window
Im waitin at the door
To see if youll be coming by
The way you did before

You told me you were taken
But now you've set me free
And I believed you when you said
Your only love was me
Your only love was me
I bought a silk to please you
I wear it every day
I wear it just a in case you'll call
I wore it yesterday
I wore it yesterday
I hear them talk about you
They say youre like the rest
They say youll never break away
And Im just second best
And Im just second best
Im looking out the window
Im waitin at the door
And hopin youll be coming by
The way you did before
The way you did before




 The record man said'Don't let it go to your head,I'm gonna make you a star'
If you've got it,use it,but don't abuse it,gave me money from an old fruit jar
To exercise my delight,I went out that night and shook the town the way I knew how
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now
Six months later I'm a cool operator,and I know my way around
The record man sighed,he really tried,but he couldn't get it off the ground
But that don't bother me now cos I've got a friend who's gotta friend who really knows how
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now
Still hanging on, still hanging on,hang on
I met this real live walking,self-styled,self-assured,slow talking bore
I thought I'd play him along,give him a song,to keep the doom dust away from my door
But I didn't do what he wanted me to,but it didn't seem to matter somehow
So mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now
Still hanging on, still hanging on,hang on
Six months later I'm a part time waiter,but that didn't last long
I stretched and squeezed at words I'd never heard to write a song
And when it finally came,it sounded the same as a tune I'd heard before somehow
But mama please don't worry about me,I'm nearly famous now
Still hanging on, still hanging on




 I had a chance for glory
Ooh, oh wouldn't tell you no lies
Same end on another story
I, I could have prophesied
I, I'd lose the prize
I'm gonna raid the future
Ooh, oh and I wanna know why
Everything is so temporary
Ooh, those I'll let you know eyes
I, I should have realized
I'm no hero, I won't get the glory
I'm the one who's left behind
I'm no hero, no place in your story
I'm the man who's left behind
I must have been blind
Must have been
I needed understanding
Ooh, oh you didn't sympathies
Left me here, left without a warning
Oh, you left me paralyzed
I, I should have realized
I'm no hero, I won't get the glory
I'm the one who's left behind
I'm no hero, no place in your story
I'm the man who's left behind
I must have been blind
Must have been, oh, so blind ahh, blind
I'm no hero, I won't get the glory
I'm the one who's left behind
I'm no hero, no place in your story
I'm the man who's left behind
I must have been blind, yeah
Must have been blind
Ooh, just must have been blind
I must have been blind
Ooh, just must have been
Just must have been blind
I must have been blind, can't see
Must have been blind
Just must have been blind
Ooh just must have been
Just must have been blind




 Well, you don't know how much you mean to me
I said goodbye, I left you there to cry
Well, you don't know how much I miss you so
But now it's done, now I'm the lonely one
You heard me say upon that rainy day
"Please set me free 'cos I don't want to know!"
Well, you don't know how much you mean to me
I said goodbye, I left you there to cry

Well, you don't know how much you mean to me
I said goodbye, I left you there to cry
Well, you don't know how much I miss you so
But now it's done, now I'm the lonely one
You heard me say upon that rainy day
"Please set me free 'cos I don't want to know!"
Well, you don't know how much you mean to me
I said goodbye, I left you there to cry
Well you don't know how much you mean to me
I love you so, baby, come on home
I hope and pray that you'll come back someday
I'll have my fun, now I'm the lonely one
I'll have my fun, now I'm the lonely one




 In a matter of moments, in a matter of moments
In a matter of moments, in a matter of moments
I fell in love in a matter of moments
And the world was mine
And the world was mine
My dreams came true in a matter of moments
And my world was you
Yes my world was you
Oh! bird of paradise you open up your wings
You showed me all the things
That I wanted to see
So if love calls in a matter of moments
Then the world is yours
Then the world is yours
Oh bird of paradise you open up your wings
And you showed me all the things
That I wanted to see
So if love calls in matter of moments
Then the world is yours
Then the world is yours




 If what you said last night is true
Then you don't know me as well as you should
No one could ever be so wrong
And if this look I wear fools you
Well I got a good reason
You see I'm really not so strong
I need love like every other man
Get scared when you turn away
I need love I will do all I can - stay
Now I've seen sorrow felt no pain
I never felt nothing at all
It's not the way I wanna be
And when you're gone these empty hours
Cut me again
What does it take to make you see
I need love like every other man
Get scared when you turn away
I need love and I'll do all I can please stay
Somebody up there likes me
Cause they've opened up the door
You won't see me chasing rainbows anymore
I need love like any other man
Get scared when you turn away
I need love I'll do all I can please stay




 Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah!
Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah!
When the world in which you live in
Gets a bit too much to bear
And you need someone to lean on
When you look, there's no one there
You're gonna find me, out in the country
Yeah, you're gonna find me, way out in the country
Where the air is good, and the day is fine
And the pretty girl, has a hand in mine
And the silver stream, is a poor man's wine
In the country, in the country
When you're walking in the city
And you're feeling rather small
And the people on the sidewalk
Seem to form a solid wall
You're gonna find me, out in the country
Hey, you're gonna find me, way out in the country
Where the air is good, and the day is fine
And the pretty girl, has a hand in mine
And the silver stream, is a poor man's wine
In the country, in the country
Hurry, hurry, hurry
For the time is slipping by
You don't need a ticket
It belongs to you and I
Come on an join me, out in the country
Where the air is good, and the day is fine
And the pretty girl, has a hand in mine
And the silver stream, is a poor man's wine
In the country, in the country
Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah!
Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah! Ba-ba-ba-Bah!




 You waken from a dream
You step outside
To find the world is changing
Under your feet
Somewhere in the past
Is the world you knew
Soon you'll find that freedom
Is not so sweet
I can't imagine why you'd throw it all away
After everything i've said to you today
When you turn around to find there's
No one then you finally realize what you've done
In the night when there's no one there at all
In the night do you hear somebody call
You see someone and you tell yourself you're wrong
You hear a voice and you know it must belong
To the night just a shadow on the wall
And there's no one there at all
I gave you everything
Everything i had endlessly
Believing your love was true
And you will never know just how it hurt
To find that you were turning to someone new
I know that we can't ever change
What has been said but how can i
Believe our love is really dead
When you turn around to find there's no one
Then you finally realize what you've done
In the night when there's no one there at all
In the night do you hear somebody call
You see someone and you tell yourself you're wrong
You hear a voice and you know it must belong
To the night just a shadow on the wall
And there's no one there at all
-solo-
And when you turn around to find there's no one
Then you finally realize what you've done
In the night...




 I only came to say goodbye
Because I hope to make you stay
Is it any wonder that I try
To stop you from going away
It can't be right to say good bye
I can't believe I'm just a friend
If we're merely friends, why should I cry?
Why should my life come to an end?
Don't you think you could call your friends
Tell them that you have missed your train
Then once again I could try to explain
Why you needn't go at all
Deep down inside we both must know
That you and I could ride so high
I know it is wrong to let you go
So I'll never say goodbye
Don't you think you could call your friends
Tell them that you've missed your train
Then once again I could try to explain
Why you needn't go at all
Deep down inside we both must know
That you and I could ride so high
I know it is wrong to let you go
So I'll never say goodbye
No, no, not goodbye




 Well, she was just 17You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another (Ooh)When I saw her standing there Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Whooh)When I saw her standing there Well, my heart went "boom"When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine... Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)Since I saw her standing there Well, my heart went "boom"When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine... Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Whooh)Since I saw her standing there




 I believed in fairy tales
In magic spells and wishing wells and pirate sails
And once I thought I'd never fall in love
That shows how much I knew
And I believed in Superman
In Santa Claus the World of Oz and Wonderland
But one by one those fantasies have failed
While you keep shining through
I still believe in you
I could never doubt your kiss
No other love fills me like this
If you take a chance, you'll see
I believe in you, believe in me
But one by one those fantasies have failed
While you keep shining through
And I still believe in you
I could never doubt your kiss
No other love fills me like this
If you take a chance, you'll see
I believe in you, believe in me
Other dreams may turn to dust
But I don't care, if you'll be there I'll always trust
'Cause I believe with all my heart and soul
This dream we share is true
And I still believe in you




 Makin' our moves, turnin' the wheel
Trying to hide the things we feel
Playin' the game, passin' the blame
It isn't enough to pretend to make out
Our hearts are hard in our own hands
We hold all the cards
It has to be you, has to be me
Has to be everyone together
It has to be you, has to be you
We're all trying to make it better
Has to be you, has to be you
We're so blind that we can't see
That it has to be you, has to be me
Isn't it sad, isn't it strange
We say we need re-arrange
But never ourselves always somebody else
Another defence, another excuse
Pointing the finger where we choose
We just don't believe it's ourselves we deceive
It has to be you, has to be me
Has to be everyone together
It has to be you, has to be you
We're all trying to make it better
Has to be you, has to be you
We're so blind that we can't see
That it has to be you, has to be me
See how we live, each to his own
Everyone scared to be alone
Still we go on as tho' nothing was wrong
It has to be you, has to be me
Has to be everyone together
It has to be you, has to be you
We're all trying to make it better
Has to be you, has to be you
We're so blind that we can't see
That it has to be you, has to be me




 If you hear somebody knockin' on your door
If you see somebody crawlin' across the floor
Baby it'll be me, I'll be lookin' for you
And if you see somebody climbin' up a telegraph pole
If you find a new lump in your sugar bowl
Baby it'll be me, I'll be looking for you
I'm gonna look in the mountains
Down in the deep blue sea
I'm gonna look in the forest
And look and look in every tree
If you find a new bait on your fishin' hook
And if you find a funny face in your comic book
Baby it'll be me I'll be lookin' for you
(Spoken: Well, keep on lookin')
I'm gonna look in the cities
Where the lights are blue
Gonna search the country side
And the haystacks too
Well if you see something shootin' out across the stars
If you see a rocket ship in it's way to Mars
Baby it'll be me
Yeah I'll be lookin' for you
I'll be lookin' for you
Well, I'll be lookin' for you




 Who's gonna shoe your pretty feet
Who's gonna hold your hand
Who's gonna take you out tonight
To listen to the band
Who'll be the one you love to love
Who's gonna be your beau
Who's gonna show you off tonight
When he takes you to the show
It'll be me babe, it'll be me
Comin' for thee babe, comin' for thee
In case there's any doubt
Just who I'm talkin' about
It'll be me babe, it'll be me
Who's gonna meet you in the morn
To court you through the day
Who's gonna pick you up at eight
To rock the night away
-Ahh----rock-----the night away
It'll be me babe, it'll be me
Comin' for thee babe, comin' for thee
In case there's any doubt
Just who I'm talkin' about
It'll be me babe, it'll be me yeah
I want you to know it'll be me at your door
It's gonna be gonna be gonna be me babe




 Many a tear has to fall
But it's all, in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know as love
You have words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things
Your heart can rise above
Once in a while he won't call
But it's all, in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet
And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting finger tips
And your heart will fly away
Once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet bouquet
And then he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting finger tips
And your heart will fly away
And your heart will fly fly away
And your heart will fly away

 It's all over, didn't even cry
I just stopped living
When you said goodbye
It's all over, didn't feel a thing
I just stopped living
Couldn't stand the pain
Heather grows like leaves in September
Looks as fresh in spring
Love that warms like summer sun
Shouldn't die when winter comes
Heather grows like leaves in September
Looks as fresh in spring
Love that warms like summer sun
Shouldn't die when winter comes
It's all over, didn't even cry
I just stopped living
When you said goodbye




 Dawn, it breaks
It's Christmas Day
The snow, it falls
The sky is grey
Here I am
But you're so far away
So I'm gonna dream of you
When Christmas was just we two
Now I'm just a lonely fool
And I know you'll never feel the way I feel
Though it isn't real
It's better to dream
Days seem longer than they are
Just waiting for my wishing star
So I can drift away to where you are
Cause that's when I dream of you
When Christmas sees me and you
And now I's a lonely fool
Who dreams one day you'll feel the way I do
Though it isn't real
It's better to dream
So I dream of Christmas Day
When you come back to me and say
"I never should have gone
I'm here to stay"
So I lay me down and dream of you
When Christmas sees me with you
And I is a lonely fool
Who dreams one day you'll feel the way I feel
Though it isn't real
You never will be mine
So here at Christmas time
It's better to dream




 It's in every one of us to be wise
Find your heart
And open up both your eyes
We can all know every thing
Without ever knowing why
It's in every one of us by and by
It's in every one of us
Find your heart
And open up both your eyes
We can all know every thing
Without ever knowing why
It's in every one of us by and by
It's in every one of us
I just remembered
It's like I've been sleeping for years
I'm not awake as I can be
But my seeing's better
I can see through the tears
I've been realizing that
I bought this ticket
And watching only half of the show
But there's scenery and lights
And a cast of thousands
Who all know what I know
And it's good that it's so
It's in every one of us to be wise
Find your heart
And open up both your eyes
We can all know every thing
Without ever knowing why
It's in every one of us by and by
It's in every one of us by and by




 It's not for me to say, you'll love me
It's not for me to say, you'll always care
Oh, but here for the moment, I can hold you fast
And press your lips to mine
And dream that love will last
As far as I can see this is heaven
And speaking just for me, it's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow with every passing day
Or we may never meet again but then it's not for me to say
And press your lips to mine
And dream that love will last
As far as I can see this is heaven
And speaking just for me, it's ours to share
Perhaps the glow of love will grow with every passing day
Or we may never meet again but then it's not for me to say
It's not for me to say, it's not for me to say




 It's no use pretending
What's done is done
And you can't turn back the clock
It's no use pretending
What you have said
Will stay inside my head
Oh it's over
I tried to please you
But all you could do
Was talk behind my back
Now I see through you
Nothing I could say or do
Would get to you
You've bitten off more than you can chew
Although I've got to say we're through
There's nothing I would rather do
Than be with you
There's more to you than meets the eye
I must admit you used to try
But since you've gone the other way
Your head is in the sky




 It's wonderful to be young
In love with life
If life's a mystery who cares
As long as I have you
Our love will always see us through
And
It's wonderful to be young
No doubts no fears
If everything goes wrong we'll laugh
And make a brand new start
Aur love will never let us part
Who can tell what lies ahead
Or where the fates will lead me
I'll come through if I have you
To want and need me
It's wonderful to be young
In love with life
And life is wonderful because
You promised to be mine for now
Until the end of time
It's oh so wonderful . . 




 I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart, that you're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I've tried so not to give in
I've said to myself this affair never will go so well
But why should I try to resist, when baby will I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear
Don't you know you fool, you never can win
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
But each time I do, just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin




 I wake up crying
After tossin' and turnin'
And a-yearnin' the whole night long
Pretty baby since you went away
I haven't spent a happy day
I wake up crying
After sobbin' and sighin'
And a-wonderin' just what went wrong
Pretty baby I was good to you
Why'd you go and make me blue
I need your arms to hold me tight
I need your sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
I'm so unhappy on my own
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely
I wake up crying
After tossin' and turnin'
And a-yearnin' the whole night long
Pretty baby please come back to me
Save me from this mesery
Oh baby won'tcha save me from this mesery
Please baby won'tcha save me from this mesery




 We can still turn back
We can change our minds
No harm done
We can play it safe
And not let our feelings go
But if we fall into this ocean
And it carries us away
You should know
I will not be a mistake
Or something you have to forget
I can be the slightest breeze
That passes through your life
The smile that comes from thinking
Of this rainy night
I'll be a chance you had to take
A heart you had to break
But I will not be a mistake
I can tell you now
That I hope we never
Say goodbye
But sometimes hearts collide
And then move on
You can say that we were foolish
It was reckless, it was weak
But it won't be wrong
Let me love you with all I have
And if we let go then all I ask'
Is to be the slightest breeze
That passes through your life
The smile that comes from thinking
Of this rainy night
I'll be a chance you had to take
A heart you had to break
But I will not be a mistake
You're just moving on
I got nights to remember
After you're gone




 Life was filled with guns and war
And everyone got trampled on the floor
I wish we'd all been ready
Children died the day grew cold
A piece of bread could buy a bag of gold
I wish we'd all been ready
There's no time to change your mind
The son has come and you've been left behind
A man and wife sleep in bed she hears a noise
And turns her head he's gone
I wish we'd all been ready
Two men walking up a hill one disappears and
One's left standing still
I wish we'd all been ready
There's no time to change your mind
The son has come and you've been left behind
Life was filled with guns and war
And everyone got trampled on the floor
I wish we'd all been ready
Children died the days grew cold
A piece of bread could buy a bag of gold
I wish we'd all been ready
There's no time to change your mind
How could you have been so blind
The father spoke the demons dined
The son has come and you've been left behind




 I wish you'd change your mind and stay
It's really much too late to play games
All I want is just to talk with you
I'll even sing it if you want me to
You know my motives are sincere
And the love's the reason that we're here
Seeing you just makes me want to say
Won't you change your mind for me and stay
I just want to feel your arms about me
Is that too much to ask or do
You think that I'd be asking too much
I wish you'd change your mind and stay
It's really much too late to play games
All I want is just to talk with you
I'll even sing it if you want me to




 Please don't ask me what went wrong
I never planned it to come out like this
Silent moments, thoughtless words
I never wantedthese memories
Joanna
I love you so
Don't wait for me Joanna
I never meant to hurt you so
But now I have to let you go
Don't wait for me Joanna
I'll always say a prayer for you
And hope some day that you
Will found true love
When as children we used to play
We sat and wondered where we'd be today
I said we'd never be apart
But now we lie among the broken hearts
Joanna
I love you so
Don't wait for me Joanna
I never meant to hurt you so
But now I have to let you go
Don't wait for me Joanna
I'll always say a prayer for you
And hope some day that you
Will found true love
Don't wait, no no
Joanna
I can't let go, no
Don't walk away Joanna
I never meant to huert you so
But now I know I can't let you go
Don't walk away Joanna
I'll always say a prayer for you
And I hope that you will find
In me true love




 Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he'd play the guitar just like a ringing a bell
Go go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go go, Johnny B. Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
The engineerswould see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play
Go go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go go, Johnny B. Goode
His mother told him "Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."
Go go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go, go Johnny go
Go go, go go, Johnny B. Goode




 Mister can you tell me
Where I'll find a man called Joseph
Travelled unknown weary miles
To see a man called Joseph
Gonna see a man about a job
Employment with a difference, call it love
Gone to see the king
Gone a son to bring ho-o-ome, ho-o-ome
Mister can you tell me
Where I'll find a girl called Mary, ah-hah
She told me that she lived this way-ay-ay-ay
Mary, ah-hah
Gonna see a man about a job
Employment with a difference, call it love
Gone to see the king
Gone a son to bring ho-o-ome, ho-o-ome
People come with me now
Come feel the joy
People come with me now
Come see the boy
Come see - the boy-oy...
Gonna see a man about a job
Employment with a difference, call it love
Hah-ah, gone to see the king
Gone a son to bring ho-o-ome
Gone to see the king
Gone a son to bring...




 Looking down on a Junior Cowboy
I see myself at the end of each day
I'm feeling sad somehow
My rumble tumble days are over now
Took Loopy Loo to a paper hat party
And fought the kid who tried to take her away
I'm feeling sad somehow
My rumble tumble days are over now
Running away,you don't know,you don't care
Funny the way that we change
Playing spoof at the back of the schoolyard
With no thought for the rest of the day
I'm feeling sad somehow
'Cause my rumble tumble days are over now




 Just another guy that you see around
No more than a face somewhere in a crowd
And when you pass, I'm filled with sorrow
Cause you're near and yet you're so far away
I know that I'm a fool for wanting what I can't have
If I said I loved you, you'd only laugh
So each night I dream that you're mine
And wake each morning only to find
That I'm just another guy
I know in my heart - I don't stand a chance
But I just can't end this one way romance
Maybe some day, I'll be there by your side
But if I remain just another guy
You'll be here in my heart for ever
And I know that darling, you'll never be
Just another girl to me




 Love had ended
Can't be mended
All along the line
I've been true to you
Even though for some time
I knew we were through
I was feeling
That love had ended
Can't be mended
But I can't bear to see you cry
The feeling's gone
It's been missing too long
But I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
It's such a shame
That it's ended this way
But I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
There'll be no goodbyes
There are no words to say
When you realise
That I'm far away
You'll be hurting
Like I've been hurting
The truth was burning
But I just can't say goodbye
The feeling's gone
It's been missing too long
But I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
It's such a shame
That it's ended this way
But I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
Ooh but I just don't have the heart
I just don't have the heart to tell you
If I stopped to think about
The good times that we shared
I could fool myself believing
That somehow love, love was still there
Ooh (love, love, love, love, love had ended)
(Love, love, love, love, love had ended)
I was feeling
That love had ended
Can't be mended
But I can't bear to see you cry
(Repeat Chorus)




 The one you love, the one you care for
Has told you everything you ever lived for
The one you love just walked into your life
She said, hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever and keep me from harm
Hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever in your loving arms
'Cos I love you and I need you
And I want you here for evermore
I'm just so crazy about you
The one you love, the one you prayed for
Brought you an angel and the angel stayed for
The light of love just walked into your life
She said, hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever and keep me from harm
Hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever in your loving arms
'Cos I love you and I need you
And I want you here for evermore
I'm just so crazy about you
The only one you ever lost your heart for
The one you cried a million times for
Your only dream has walked into your life
She said, hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever and keep me from harm
Hold me and keep me warm
Hold me for ever in your loving arms
'Cos I love you and I need you
And I want you here for evermore
I'm just so crazy about you




 This is the night that I have planned on
Darling there are stars that I had in mind
This is the moment I’ve dreamed of
The moment that love goes blind
Kiss, kiss me say you miss

Kiss, kiss me darling then
Kiss me once again
Make my dreams come true
This is the night that I have planned on
Look there are stars that I had in mind
This is the moment I’ve dreamed of
The moment that love goes blind
Kiss, kiss me say you miss
Miss me, kiss me love
With heavenly affection
Hold, hold me close to you
Hold me, see me through

Thrill, thrill me with your charms
Take me in your arms
Make my life perfection
Kiss, kiss me darling then
Kiss me once again
Make my dreams come true
Come true, come true
Make them all come true




 La Gonave I see your mist
La Gonave well I know you're kissed
By the same sea of trouble
That stretches back home
La Gonave
You've got troubles of your own
Yes I got troubles
Won't you come on and see
I got my needs just follow me
But they gonna ease by and by
If you tell all the people
That it's no lie
You only came for forty eight hours
Didn't realise how useless I was
Came to you for the nation sells lies
Lord knows but I still feel helpless
La Gonave I don't feel good
La Gonave do you think I should
Turn my back and walk away
La Gonave tell me what to say
If I'd been at home
Would you telephone me
I'm situated across the sea
But it's a small world from any point
Of view
Spare a thought
This could have been you
You shook my senses
Took my time
Froze my feeling
Broke my mind
La Gonave you've played your part
La Gonave you sure got heart
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco
Didn't want to stay in Omaha
Never got fooled by New York City
But I lost my heart to La Gonave
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco
Didn't want to stay in Omaha
Never got fooled by New York City
But I lost my heart to La Gonave
Didn't leave my heart in San Francisco
Didn't want to stay in Omaha
Never got fooled by New York City
But I lost my heart to La Gonave




 Excusez-moi, my pretty Mademoiselle
You are a French girl it's easy to tell
Me, I don't smoke not even a French cigarette
But I love my pomme de terre
And always croquette
I am from Angleterre and you are from France
And you will honour me by having a dance
Chorus:
Straight away!
I'm getting ready for a new sensation
Never kissed them in another nation
Internationally I'm in clover
I was a native on the boat ride over
Straight away!
I'm getting ready for my new vocation
I am the man who will unite the nations
Ooh la la/how you say it/ca va-this is love
La la la la la la la language of love
La la la la la la la language of love
La la la la la la la language of love
We've been together now for more than a day
And I am waiting to hear what you say
Come on, come on, I think you're telling me lies
You are Italian, I can tell by your eyes
I love Chianti and I hope you'll agree
That Zefferelli makes the movies for me
Chorus Repeated
Instrumental
I try my French, Latin, Spanish and Greek
This is the language of love that I speak
I never know if they're from Paris or Rome
We stop the talking when I'm walking them home
One little kiss and then heavens above
This is the universal language of love
Straight away!
Are you ready for a new sensation
I'm gonna kiss a girl from every nation
(Rest of chorus as before)
This is love-the language of love




 The first step to heaven I will take in my life
I am not afraid when I can hold you tight
If there must be an answer then there must be a prayer
And you must be the angel when you're standing there
So I lean on you, I lean on you
My life is such a statement of my hopes and despairs
But nothing really matters just as long as you're there
You love me such honesty, you love with no gain
You speak to me so tender and you never explain
So I lean on you, I lean on you
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby knows what I'm gonna do
That's why I lean on you
I dream of an island, of a fantasy place
Where I can go to sometimes and nobody can trace
Well such is the nature, the nature of love
That when we dream it sometimes means that we need love
So I lean on you, I lean on you
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby knows what I'm gonna do
That's why I lean on you
So I lean on you, I lean on you
I lean on you, so I lean on you
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby she tells me what to do
She always tells me the truth
My baby she cares, it's so easy to do
My baby knows what I'm gonna do
That's why I lean on you




 Legata a un granello di sabbia
Mi vuoi lasciare, tu vuoi fuggire
Ma sola al buio tu poi mi chiamerai
Ti voglio cullare, cullare
Posandoti su un'onda del mare, del mare
Legandoti a un granello di sabbia
Cos tu nella nebbia pi fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai
Ti voglio tenere, tenere
Legata con un raggio di sole, di sole
Cos col tuo calore la nebbia svanir
E il tuo cuore riscaldarsi potr
E mai pi freddo sentirai
Ma tu, tu fuggirai
E nella notte ti perderai
E sola, sola
Sola nel buio
Mi chiamerai
Ti voglio cullare, cullare
Posandoti su un onda del mare, del mare
Legandoti a un granello di sabbia
Cos tu nella nebbia pi fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai
Ti voglio tenere, tenere
Legata con un raggio di sole, di sole
Cos col suo calore la nebbia svanir
E il tuo cuore riscaldarsi potr
E mai pi freddo sentir
Ma tu, tu fuggirai
E nella notte ti perderai
E sola, sola
Sola nel buio
Mi chiamerai
Ti voglio cullare, cullare
Posandoti su un onda del mare,del mare
Legandoti a un granello di sabbia
Cos tu nella nebbia pi fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai
Ai iai iai iai
Ai iai iai iai iai




 First you cuddle up beside me nice and near
Then you whisper all the things I long to hear
That's the first lessson in love
Mmmm...Give me your heart
Then you put your two sweet lips on mine like this
And you'll learn the magic of a tender kiss
That's the next lesson in love
Mmmm....lesson in love
It's so easy when you know how
O my darling let me show you now
Last you whisper I love you so sweetly
Then I'll know you've learned it all completely
That's the last lesson in love
Mmmm...baby love me true




 When you're out in the ocean
And you're swimming against the tide
When you're climbing a mountain
And the mountain seems too high
Never give up believing
Love is on your side
When the darkness surrounds you
And you cannot see your way
When the loneliness finds you
And there is no hiding place
Never give up believing
Love will save the day
Open up the gates
You closed around your heart
Someone is waiting to come in
Let Me be the One
That you hold on to
I will bring the sun to shine on you
Your lonely days are gone
The best is yet to come
If you let Me be the One
When the weight on your shoulders
Is too much to bear
There's no burden too heavy
That cannot be shared
You can run into My heart
Lay your troubles there
They say surrender brings freedom for the soul
Well, don't you think it's time
That you let Me know
And let Me be the One
That you hold on to
Cos I will bring the sun to shine on you
Your lonely days are gone
The best is yet to come
If you let Me be the One
(verse music)
Open up the gates
You closed around your heart
Someone is waiting to come in
Let Me be the One
That you hold on to
I will bring the sun to shine on you
Your lonely days are gone
The best is yet to come
If you let Me be the One
Won't you let Me be the One!!




 I have a feeling, it's a feeling
I'm concealing, I don't know why
It's just a mental, sentimental alibi
But I adore you
So strong for you
Why go on stalling
I am falling
Our love is calling
Why be shy?
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it
Let's close our eyes and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try
To make a go of it
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not be
Let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not be
Let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love 




 Cliff:
The bush upon the rotor pump
Is pushed into the floater sump
It's wearing out the grunion teeth
By bearing on the cog beneath
Which means in terms of tension swings
The seams of your suspension springs
In cyclic thirds are set apart
In very simple words, dear ladies
Your car won't start
All singing:
So we're making this offer
Ride with us, come ride with us
Through the countryside with us
For our bus has every comfort inside
We are pleading
Please let us take you for a ride
Short music break
Cliff:
To try to wrench the gyro sphere
Without a bench would take all year
Don't risk it like this on the road
The brisket feed light might explode
Someone else:
The ball valve's past the hydrotrend
There's something nasty round the bend
The loofah (?) tank is running slow (low?)
All:
To put it very frankly
Ladies, your car won't go
So ride with us
Come ride with us
Better be allied with us
Here's an offer
That is quite bona fide
We are pleading
Please let us take you for a ride
Very long music break
CLIFF: (Very fast)
You know I wouldn't be surprised
That gasket hood looks pulverised
The shock recoil is now reversed
(missing line)
Compression (seep?) will soon distend
The leak that leaks in your big end
The lousy coke has got a hitch
Around the choke adjustment switch
Your piston spark (spout?) is dynamite
(in?/and?) cutting off the parking light
And, from its shake, your outside brake
Is needing a new drum!
ALL: (slower)
In fact make no mistake
You've really had it chum
CLIFF: (with others singing different words at the same time)
So ride with us
Come ride with us
(missing lines)
Past the forest
And the riverside
Take a tour with us
That's really nation-wide
For as guys we're really qualified
There's no need to look terrified
For when you have tried
You will say - wide-eyed!
We are just what the doctor specified
We are pleading, please let us take you for a...
...ride with us, ride with us
Short music break
Please let us take you for a ride

 There's a girl down a lonely street
Breaking hearts seven days a week
She got an look in her eye
For a red-blooded guy like me
I'm breaking out in a cold cold sweat
And I'm in a kind of rush to get to...
Little Mistreater
You know it when you meet her
Little Mistreater
Yeah, that's her name
Treating love like a game
I'm so scared when she calls my name
This kind of girl drives a man insane
You give her all that you can
She raps on your door again
I need some time just to catch my breath
Tell me honey do I past your test
The Little Mistreater
You know it when you meet her
Little Mistreater
Yeah, that's her name
She's an old flame
(Tell me now) Somebody tell me
(Somebody) What to do when your
Love won't leave, (heart won't leave)
I can almost hear the sad goodbyes
When I see her walking down the street
There she goes
The Little Mistreater
You know it when you meet her
Little Mistreater
You know it when you meet her
Yeah, that's her name
Playing the game
Just, just, just....Little Mistreater
(Every day she's got guys on a string)
Little Mistreater
(She's a girl don't have to do anything)
Little Mistreater (repeated......)




 Blow her a kiss from across the room
Say she looks nice when she's not
Touch her hair as you pass her chair
Little things mean a lot
Give her your arm as you cross the street
And call her at six on the dot
A line a day when you're far away
Little things mean a lot
Don't have to buy her diamonds or pearls
Champagne, sables, and such
For she never cared much for diamonds and pearls
But honestly, honey, they just cost money
Give her a hand when she's lost the way
Give her your shoulder to cry on
Whether the day is sunny or gray
Give her your heart to rely on
Send her the warmth of a secret smile
Show you haven't forgot
For now and forever, that's always and ever
Little things mean a lot
Little things mean a lot




 O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above the deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in the dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
The lord Emmanuel
No ear may hear his coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive him still
The dear Christ enters in




 Got myself a crying, talking, sleeping, walking, living doll
Got to do my best to please her, just cause she's a living doll
Got a roving eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walking talking, living doll
Take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
I'm gonna lock her up in a trunk
So no big hunk can steal her away from me
Got myself a crying, talking, sleeping, walking, living doll
Got to do my best to please her, just cause she's a living doll
Got a roving eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walking talking, living doll
Well, take a look at her hair, it's real
And if you don't believe what I say, just feel
Gonna lock her up in a trunk
So no big hunk can steal her away from me
Got myself a crying, talking, sleeping, walking, living doll
Got to do my best to please her, just cause she's a living doll
Got a roving eye and that is why she satisfies my soul
Got the one and only walking talking, living doll




 I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
Al ove like ours
Could never die
As long as I have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her




 Your love is like a prison wall
And it's getting higher
I get so far and then I fall
I can't get through the wire
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison
It's as though I'm doing time
And you won't free me
Let the punishment befit the crime
And say you need me
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison
Save me save me can't you see I'm innocent
Turn the key that will set me free
Please let it end oh let it end
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison
Save me save me can't you see I'm innocent
Turn the key that will set me free
Please let it end won't you let it end
I'll dig a tunnel to your heart
Let me remind you
Even gonna tear the walls apart
Until I find you
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison




 Tomorrow never comes when you are looking foward to it
You try so hard to live the day your way
But what a life if you could live the way you want it
You tried it once before but it didn't work out
You know you need someone to bring out the best in you
To be a light to you is what I intend to do
To show the way you know you ought to go
You'll see a world that will surely come into view
So take the hand that I offer to you
To see the truth that you will be no longer
Lost, lost in a lonely world (lost and lonely)
'Cos I can see that there's life in your eyes
If only you would realise
That now you don't have to settle for this
(You don't have to settle for this)
You don't have to say "There's nowhere to go"
You can find out anything you really wanna know




 I love Thee in the sky
After long, hot summer days
Like to run through the fields
When they've finished makin' hay
I love meeting people
I've never met before
And I like it when my friends
Come knocking at my door, yeah
Ooh, I love the sky at night
Just to sit and count the stars
I like to mess around
With bicycles and cars
I love to see the moon
When it's up and full
And I like it when a fish
Gives my line a pull
So, it's easy to see
Just how good You been to me
Oh, you made life's mystery
An open book for all to see
I love stone ground bread
And I like it when I get my breakfast in bed
I love little old ladies
Who make funny faces at brand new babies
So, it's easy to see
Just how good You been to me
Oh, you made life's mystery
An open book for all to see
I love St. Judy's comet
I love to break bread
I get a blessing from it
And I love to see a Bible
That's been well used
'Cause when a Bible's well used
The devil's not amused
So, it's easy to see
Just how good You been to me
Oh, you made life's mystery
An open book for all to see
So, it's easy to see
Just how good You been to me
Oh, you made life's mystery
An open book for all to see
Yeah, yeah
Anyone can read the book
Oh, the feel of a long, hot summer day
I love, I love
Little old ladies, who make funny faces at brand new babies
You made life's mystery and open book for all to see
I love breaking bread
I love to see a Bible when it's been well read
When it's well used, you know the devil's not amused
I love, I love, I love, I love, yeah
I love, I love, I love, I love




 One day away from you, I'm feeling
Something new
The way you look at me says everything
It's much too late to hide, what's building up inside
Hot blood is rushing through my heart and soul
Chorus:
Love is the strongest emotion
No-one can stop what we do
Love is the strongest emotion
That you'll ever feelwhen your love is real
I've been awake all night, my eyes are open wide
I never dreamed you, you're no fantasy
Oh, don't make me wait too long
Cause you're the only one girl you change my
Wishes to reality
Repeat chorus
And I wanna touch, and I wanna feel
What you do to me
Cause nothing on earth can move me like you
Come on baby show mecause I need to give my
Love to you
I wanna touch, and I wanna feel
What you do to me
Cause, nothing on earth can move me like you
Come on baby show me, cause Ineed to
Give my love
Love is the strongest emotion
No-one can stopwhat we do
Love is the strongest emotion
That you'll ever feel when you know
Your love is real




 This suspense is killing me
I can't stand uncertainty
Tell me now, I got to know
Whether you want me to stay or go
Love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else
You might find the nighttime the right time for kissing
But nighttime is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue
I want your love, but I don't want to borrow
To have it today, to give back tomorrow
For my love is your love, there's no love for nobody else
Oh, love me or leave me, let me be lonely
You won't believe me and I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else
You might find the nighttime the right time for kissing
But nighttime is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue, oh, so blue
I want your love, but I don't want to borrow
To have it today, to give back tomorrow
For I couldn't bear it, to share it with somebody else




 Did you know I can feel your smile?
You and I grow closer all the while
Can't think of a time when you're more than I love you away
You are the moon in my night
You're the sun in my day
Shine on, shine on
Have I told you, you're my morning star?
You're my rainbow, you're my Summer shower
Can't think of a time when you're more than a raindrop away
You are the moon in my night
You're the sun in my day
Shine on
Do my ears deceive me?
Or did you say you'd not leave me?
That from now on, we could be together
Closer than a hand is to a glove
That I'm the only one you love
It's forever
Love on
(Instrumental)
Do my ears deceive me?
Or did you say you'd not leave me?
That from now on, we could be together
Closer than a hand is to a glove
That I'm the only one you love
It's forever, forever, forever
Love on (forever)
Love on (forever)




 Did you know I can feel your smile?
You and I grow closer all the while
Can't think of a time when you're more than "I love you" away
You are the moon in my night, you're the sun in my day
Shine on, shine on!
Have I told you you're my morning star?
You're my rainbow, you're my summer shower
Can't think of a time when you're more than a raindrop away
You are the moon in my night, you're the sun in my day
Shine on!
Do my ears deceive me
Or did you say you'd not leave me
That from now on we could be together?
Closer than a hand is to a glove
That I'm the only one you love –
It's forever!
Love on!
Do my ears deceive me
Or did you say you'd not leave me
That from now on we could be together?
Closer than a hand is to a glove
That I'm the only one you love –
It's forever!
(Forever)
Love on!
(Forever)
Love on!
(Forever)




 Once they were lovers but now they're not friends
She's found another and he says it's the end
To think they once tore down a wall for a door
But now they don't speak anymore
So he walks the streets, the few nights he can stand
Drinking her memory away when he can
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore
But now they don't cry anymore
How does it all come to happen
That's not what loving is for
And if I thought it was,I would leave here in the morning
I'd sooner sleep on the floor
Oh when will we learn really what loving is
It's not what you get in return but what you give
To think they once tore down a wall for a door
But now they don't speak anymore




 You better look out
You're not living in a bad dream now
Open your eyes
You'll survive another day somehow
After the night
There's a morning and a clear blue sky
You can be sure
You can make it and I'll tell you why
You're walking in your sleep
Hey that's all right
But don't you spend the whole night
Uptight
I'm here to lend a hand
Hey don't you understand
One chance is for taking
One heart is for breaking
One love is for making
Lovers and friends
One game is for playing
One prayer is for praying
One day is for staying
Lovers and friends
Lovers and friends
You better wake up
Cause every day you waste is time gone by
Up on your feet
You can take it but you gotta try
After the night
There's a morning and a clear blue sky
You can be sure
You can make it and I'll tell you why
You're walking in your sleep
Hey that's all right
But don't you spend the whole night
Uptight
I'm here to lend a hand
Hey don't you understand
One chance is for taking
One heart is for breaking
One love is for making
Lovers and friends
One game is for playing
One prayer is for praying
One day is for staying
Lovers and friends
(Repeat from 'one chance' to end)




 I don't know how to play it
I don't know how to say it
But it's true
Oooooh I'm losing you
I only know that maybe
You and I have got to talk things trough
But baby before we do
I'm telling you
Chorus:
You can go right on breaking my heart
I wouldn't care at all
You can go right on taking my love
I'll never close the door
And even thoughi know you don't
Love me anymore
You can hurt me but you won't break down
My love
I don't know what began it
It happens all the time
So I've been told
Love grows old and cold
Not for me the easy way
I love you then and now I love you still
And I guess I always will
Meanwhile....
Repeat chorus
Not for me the easy way
I don't want no trial seperation
I'd rather face the sleepless nights
Working on our love's salvation
Repeat chorus
Love's salvation
(you've got to keep working on)
Our love's salvation
(You've got to keep working on)
Repeat 'til fade.........




 When she's got her eye on you - there's no escape
She keeps unnoticed - hidden under her cape
She shows no mercy - no - she plays it rough but
She don't want your money - she just wants your love
Better call the cops - better call the cops
Better call the police
Better come quick - better come quick
While I'm in one piece
Better bring a book - better bring a book
Gonna press charges - for attempted
Breaking and entering my heart
Yeah
Cause she's a lovestealer - raw dealer
Heart breakin' - love takin' yeah-yeah
Love stealer - raw dealer
Heart breakin' - love takin' yeah-yeah-yeah
She hangs around - casing the joint
Then she'll move in and get - right to the point
Take my advice and keep your love to yourself
Or the love stealer will rob you-
Leave you there on the shelf
Better call the cops - better call the cops
Better call the police
Better come quick - better come quick
While I'm in one piece
Better bring a book - better bring a book
Gonna press charges - for attempted
Breaking and entering my heart
Yeah

Better bring a book - take a look
Press charges
For attempted breaking and entering my heart
Yeah...

 When I was just a little baby I didn't have many toys
But my mama used to say: "Son, you've more than other boys
Now you may not be good looking, and you may not be too rich
But you'll never ever be alone, 'cause you've got lucky lips!"
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!
Now I never get heartbroken, no, I never get the blues
And if I play that game of love, I know I just can't lose
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is akiss my chips
And I know I'm 'bout to win, yeah, 'cause I've got lucky lips!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue
Lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true!
I don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or a good look charm
With lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms!




 Magic is the moonlight
On this lover's dream night
As I see the moonlight
Shining in your eyes
Can't resist their power
In this moon lit hour
Love being any flower
This is paradise
Living in the splendor
Of your kiss so tender
Makes my heart surrender
To your love divine
Magic is the moonlight
More than any dream night
Magic is the moonlight
For it made you mine
Living in the splendor
Of your kiss so tender
Makes my heart surrender
To your love divine
Magic is the moonlight
More than any dream night
Magic is the moonlight
For it made you mine
Magic is the moonlight
For it made you mine




 Tonight there's a magic that I can't explain
Tune-up and start the show all set now ready to go
This band's gonna really rock tonight
Steppin' out upon the stage
Under those lights again
We're gonna shake the place tonight
They gotta new song high in the charts you know
You must have heard them play it on the radio
When that flat top starts that picking
Hear the bass drum start that kicking
The joint is really jumpin' now
Ooh mama it's so exiting to feel
That tension rising when they turn the house lights down
It's a strange kinda magic that never seems to age
Makin' history
Makin' history
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll
Makin' history
Makin' history
Playing a new beat to the glory
That is rock'n'roll
Rock on
They gotta new song
High in the charts you know
You must have heard them play it on the radio
Hear the start and the jumbo gibson
You don't know what you're missing if you're not
Painting the town tonight
Ooh mama it's so exiting to feel
That tension rising when they turn the house lights down
Makin' history
Makin' history
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll
Makin' history
Makin' history
Playing a new beat to the glory
That is rock'n'roll
Makin' history
Makin' history
Adding a new leaf to the story that is rock'n'roll
Makin' history
Makin' history
Playing a new beat to the glory that is rock'n'roll
Mama it's so exiting-oh oh
Don't you find the beat exiting




 Man gratuliert mir und applaudiert mir
Seit jenem Sonntag, da ich mich in dich verliebt
Man gratuliert mir und applaudiert mir
Weil's Girls wie dich nur alle Jubeljahre gibt
Wie du mir zärtlich sagst, my little Cassanova
Der Flirt mit Jane und Pat und Mary-Ann, that's over
Und auch I'm Club da lässt du Jack und Johnny steh'n
Dass sie seh'n du gehörst zu mir
Man gratuliert mir und applaudiert mir
Seit jenem Sonntag, da ich mich in dich verliebt
Man gratuliert mir und applaudiert mir
Weil's Girls wie dich nur alle Jubeljahre gibt
Ich hatte Angst du liebst nur meinen tollen Wagen
Und wollte dir schon das auf 'bye bye, darling' sagen
Nun bleibst du ewig füare mein Leben unentbehrlich
Und das ist ehrlich und ist keine Schau
Man gratuliert mir und applaudiert mir
Seit jenem Sonntag, da ich mich in dich verliebt
Man gratuliert mir und applaudiert mir
Weil's Girls wie dich nur alle Jubeljahre gibt

 Marianne, must I live for only yesterday?
Now you've gone away, Marianne
Marianne, all I have is just a memory
Of what you mean to me, Marianne
Here am I without a love to my name
I shall be just following my lonely heart
Endlessly must I be calling your name
Telling you I am waiting
Won't you please come back again?
Marianne, must I wait until eternity?
Please come back to me, Marianne
Here am I without a love to my name
I shall be just following my lonely heart
Endlessly must I be calling your name
Telling you I am waiting
Won't you please come back again?
Marianne, must I wait until eternity?
Please come back to me, Marianne
Please come back to me, Marianne




 How can I bear this? Show me
How can I survive
Trapped in your madness
With no hope of release? Oh -
Do I just wait for
Your demons to arrive?
Blaming me for your ills
While you rest in peace
You are marked with death
By your cruel lies
You deserve all this
You betrayed me
With your final breath
You will still despise
Every tear or kiss
You betrayed me
I shall not be tricked
Into pity for
You must know full well
That I love you
And you can't inflict
Any pain that's more
Than this living hell
But I love you
I see the eyes that deceived
Poor wasted hands growing cold
No lover's comfort
No belief to hold
You have killed yourself
Yours the infernal
Original sin
Mine the misfortune
Of your heartless caprice - oh -
Do I just wait for
All your devils to move in?
Blaming me for your death
While you rest in peace
I am marked for life
And the peace I crave
Is a fool's conceit
I am branded
And you'll twist the knife
From beyond the grave
And I fall, retreat
Empty handed
I shall not be tricked
Into pity for
You must know full well
That I love you
And you can't inflict
Any pain that's more
Than this living hell
But I love you
I see the eyes that betrayed
Poor wasted hands growing cold
No lover's comfort
No belief to hold
You are marked with death
How can I convince you
That you broke your own heart?
How can I forgive you
For the murderous part
You played in destroying
Your love and your life
And mine ...
I shall not be tricked
Into pity for
You must know full well
That I love you
And you can't inflict
Any pain that's more
Than this living hell
But I love you
I see the eyes that deceived
Poor wasted hands growing cold
No lover's comfort
No belief to hold
I am marked for life
You are marked with death ...




 Well, you stand there honey, with you hands on your hips
Well, it's stoppin' your feeling, baby, button your lips
Yeah, you stand there honey with the devil in your eyes
You say you're gonna leave me, but I know it's a lie
Uh uh honey, you got a mean streak
Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin' honey
You must lose your mean streak
You look so cute and you walk so nice
Oh but your hide is as mean and as cold as ice
Well, I found my heart, it was a big kind of faster
And I know I was living in disaster
Uh uh honey, you got a mean streak
Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin' honey
You must lose your mean streak
Well, you're standing there honey, and you're looking so pretty
Well, I'm gonna leave you standing there in a pity
Well, you took my love and you threw it away
And I know what's gonna happen to you someday
Uh uh honey, you got a mean streak
Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin' honey
You must lose your mean streak
Yeah, mean streak
Oh baby, mean streak
Oh honey, mean streak
Oh, mean streak

 I’ve thought my life had happiness
Until I felt your warm caress
I’ve really thought I had it made
Until I met you, then I knew
I’ve been a mighty lonely man
You touched me with your finger tips
And oh so softly kissed my lips
You said, you showed me paradise
And so I love you, and you thrilled
I’ve been a mighty lonely man
How truly love, how truly, truly love
How thrill, how very thrill was I
Then like a fool, a foolish, foolish fool
I hurt you and made you cry
Forgive this foolish man, my love
Please say you understand, my love
Return again to my embrace
And say you love me
Till you do
I’ll be a mighty lonely man
Till you do
I’ll be a mighty lonely man




 I've had many times, I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children saw me crying
I thought I'd had my share of that
But these miss you nights
Are the longest
Midnight diamonds stud my heaven
Southward burning like the jewels that eye your place
And the warm winds that embrace me
Just as surely kissed your face
Yeah, these miss you nights
They're the longest
(How I missed you) How I missed you, I'm not likely to tell
I'm a man and cold daylight buys the pride I'd rather sell
(All my secrets) All my secretes are a wasted affair
You know them well
Thinking of my going
How to cut the thread and leave it all behind
Looking windward, for my compass
I'll take each day as it arrives
But these miss you nights
Are the longest
(Lay down) Lay down all thoughts of your surrender
It's only me who's killing time
(Play down) Play down all dreams and themes once remembered
It's just the same, this miss you game
Yet these miss you nights
Are the longest




 The child is a king, the carolers sing
The old has passed, there's a new beginning
Dreams of Santa, dreams of snow
Fingers numb, faces aglow
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see
A time for living, a time for believing
A time for trusting, not deceiving
Love and laughter and joy ever after
Ours for the taking, just follow the master
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see
A time for giving, a time for getting
A time for forgiving and for forgetting
Christmas is love, Christmas is peace
A time for hating and fighting to cease
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine
Children singing Christian rhyme
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree
A time to rejoice in the good that we see

 Five days a week I'm just abiding my time
Fill in the hours till the weekend's mine
All day long I've got my radio on
Keeps me going till my work is done
Monday through to Friday
Nothing goes my way
Just working staying alive
Monday through to Sunday
There's only one day
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time
Work for the man just to get my pay
Too many hours in the working day
Dead on my feet but I need the cash
Roll on Saturday make it fast
Monday through to Friday
Nothing goes my way
Just working staying alive
Monday through to Sunday
There's only one day
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time
I pay my dues to the union man
Don't get too heavy, that's the way I am
I live for rock 'n' roll and Saturday night
I hear the music and I feel alright, feel alright
Monday through to Friday
Nothing goes my way
Just working staying alive
Monday through to Sunday
There's only one day
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time




 Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossin' you in style some day
Old dream maker, you heartbreaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me




 Free to turn like the wind on a summer day
Heart worn, like a ring around the moon
And your eyes are ablaze, reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life than standing still
Or running from place to place in the heat of the day
Just follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life
There beyond the horizon, there's another day
Far above the pain and fear you feel
The power and the peace, the greatest sensation of all
There is much more to life than you'll ever know, the rise and fall
There'll always be you and me, we're moving as one
So follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life
We all have our dreams, we all have our visions
But time after time, we're faced with decisions
Which road to follow? How hard to fight?
Then you wake up and see that there's much more to life
Free in acres of sky on a summer day
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart
We are never apart, reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life
So just follow your heart and you'll see
If you follow your heart you'll be free
'Cause there's more to life, more to life




 C'mon pretty baby let's a move it and a-groove it
Well shake oh baby, shake oh honey, please don't lose it
The rhythm that gets into your heart and soul
Well, let me tell you baby, it's called rock 'n' roll
They say it's gonna die but please let's face it
Well, they just don't know what's a goin' to replace it
Yeah, ballads and calypsos they got nothin' on
Real country music that just drives along
Well, move it
C'mon pretty baby let's a-move it and a-groove it
Well shake-a baby, shake-a honey, please don't lose it
The rhythm that gets into your heart and soul
Well, let me tell you baby, it's called rock 'n' roll
They say it's gonna die but please let's face it
They just don't know what's a-goin' to replace it
Ballads and calypsos have nothin' on
Real country music that just drives along
Oh honey, move it
Hey move it
A-ha move it
A-ha move it




 I'm thinking 'bout moving in
Commit myself to you, forget where I've been
I'm thinking thinking 'bout moving in
I'm thinking 'bout making my stand
And I know I could do it
If you give me your hand
I'm thinking 'bout making my stand
Making my stand
You changed my world
And you stood in my doorway
You changed my life
When you stepped into my mind
Used to think that there was no future before me
Now you say that I can leave my past behind
Now you say that I can leave my past behind
Behind
Don't understand why you do what you do
You keep giving your love
We give nothing to you
You keep giving your love
We give nothing to you
Used to think that there was no future before me
Now you say that I can leave my past behind
Now you say that I can leave my past behind
Behind
Don't understand why you do what you do
You keep giving your love
We give nothing to you
You keep giving your love
We give nothing to you
Here I am thinking 'bout moving in
Making my stand
Here I am thinking 'bout moving in
Making my stand




 Itemise the things you
Covet as you squander
Through your life
Bigger cars, bigger
Houses, term insurance
For your wife
Tuesday evenings with your harlot
And on Wednesdays it's
Your charlatan analyst
He's high upon your list
You got air conditioned
Sinuses and dark, disturbing doubts
About religion
And you keep those cards
And letters going out
And while your
Secretary's tempting you
Your morals are exepting
You from guilt and shame
Heaven knows
You're not to blame!
You better take care of
Business, Mr. Businessman
What's your plan?
Get down to business
Mr. Businessman, if you can
Before it's too late
And they throw your life away
Did you see your children
Growing up today
And did you hear the
Music of their laughter
As they set about to play?
And did you smell the
Fragrance of those roses
In your garden?
Did the morning sunlight
Warm your soul and
Brighten up your day?
Do you qualify to be
Alive or is the limit
Of your senses
So as only to survive?
Spending counterfeit
Incentive, wasting
Precious time and health
Placing values on the
Worthless, disregarding
Priceless wealth
Well, you can wheel and
Deal the best of them
And steal it from the rest of them
You know the score
Their ethics are a bore
86 proof anesthetic crutches
Brought you to the top
Where the smiles are all synthetic
And the ulcers never stop
When they take that final inventory
Yours will be the same
Sad story everywhere -
Noone will really care. Noone more lonely than
This rich important man
Let's have your autograph
ENDORSE your epitaph!
You better take care...
................if you can!




 Ooh I'd like to tell you something that's playing on my mind
I don't know how to tell you, so I'll take my time
I believe, I believe it's not just in my mind
Something I'm dreaming to take up the time
There's no escape - I don't want to be free
I believe that it must be love
Having trouble sleeping, you're always on my mind
When it comes to dreamin' I get left behind
I believe, I believe there's no doubt in my mind
There's no use pretending I'm hooked on your line
Words of the heart don't come easy to me
I believe that it must be love
You got me tied to a railroad track
Your love's the train - there's no turning it back
I've told you how I feel, I've laid it on the line
Got to take your love and make you feel that you're mine
I believe, I believe it's not just in my mind
Something I'm dreaming to take up the time
There's no escape - I don't want to be free
I believe that it must be love
It must be love
It must be love yeah etc..

 When the whippoorwills call
And evening is nigh
I’m so happy in my blue heaven
Just take a turn to the right
You’ll see a little white light
It lead you to my blue heaven
It’s just a smiling face, a fireplace, a cozy room
It’s a lover’s nest that nestles where the roses bloom
Just my Molly and me, and little baby makes three
We’re so happy in my blue heaven
It’s just my Molly and me, and little baby makes three
We’re so happy in my blue heaven
Just take a turn to the right
You’ll see a little white light
It lead you to my blue heaven
When the whippoorwills call
And evening is nigh
We’re so happy in my blue heaven




 If you admire coloring books
Lots of people do
I’m a new one for you
A most unusual coloring book
The kind you never see
Crayons ready, very well
Begin to color me
These are the eyes that watched her
As she walked away
Color them gray
And this is the heart that thought
She would always be true
Ah, color it blue
These are the arms that held her
And touched her then lost her, lost her somehow
Color them empty now
This is the tie I wore
Until he came between
You can color it green
This is the room I sleep in and walk in
And weep in and hide in that nobody sees
Color it lonely, please
And this is the girl
That once I depended upon
You can color her gone
Color her, color her, color her gone
Color her gone




 You really got me reelin', it's a high class feelin'
When I see your eyes a-shinin', I'm on a silver linin'
There can be no denyin', I feel just like I'm flyin'
But when you're not around, my feet hit the ground
By the juke box with the gang, it's not the place to say 'I love you'
But the moment I set eyes on you, I'm floating way above you
There can be no denyin', I feel just like I'm flyin'
But when you're not around, my feet hit the ground
The way you walk, ah huh huh
The way you talk, ah huh huh
The way you smile and dance with me
Makes me believe no need to grieve, there really is a chance for me
When I hug you, when I kiss you, well, you know I can't resist you
If you ever leave me darlin', you'll know I'm gonna miss you
There can be no denyin', I feel just like I'm flyin'
But when you're not around, my feet hit the ground
You really got me reelin', it's a high class feelin'
When I see your eyes a-shinin', I'm on a silver linin'
There can be no denyin', I feel just like I'm flyin'
But when you're not around, my feet hit the ground
By the juke box with the gang, it's not the place to say 'I love you'
But the moment I set eyes on you, I'm floating way above you
There can be no denyin', I feel just like I'm flyin'
But when you're not around, my feet hit the ground
The way you walk, ah huh huh
The way you talk, ah huh huh
The way you smile and dance with me
Makes me believe no need to grieve, there really is a chance for me
When I hug you, when I kiss you, well, you know I can't resist you
If you ever leave me darlin', you'll know I'm gonna miss you
There can be no denyin', I feel just like I'm flyin'
But when you're not around, my feet hit the ground
When you're not around, my feet hit the ground




 Right from early days from the moment I was born
I would take my guitar in the early early mornin'
And go down to the fields and play
Sittin' down there in the long grass strummin'
I could see the people from miles around comin'
To hear me sing my music and play
Well that's been my kinda life
My kinda life, yes and I like it
Well that's been my kinda life
My kinda life, yes and I like it
Well that's been my kinda life yeah
And I wouldn't spend it anywhere
Other than sittin' down somewhere
Playin' away my days, yeah
Well we made it to the city just me and my guitar
That was where I found a freaky little bar
I sat there on the stage and play
Well up came a guy who said it wasn't plastic
He wanted me to sing away my life or something drastic
But all I wanna do is play
Well that's been my kinda life
My kinda life, yes and I like it
Well that's been my kinda life
My kinda life, yes and I like it
Well that's been my kinda life yeah
And I wouldn't spend it anywhere
Other than sittin' down somewhere
Playin' away my days, just playin'
Play it
Well fame and fortune I've let them pass me by
No one in the country could say I didn't try
To turn the people and to play
You can keep all the money and the places that go with it
'Cos all I want is freedom and no cash could ever get it
All I wanna do is play
Well that's been my kinda life
My kinda life, yes and I like it
Well that's been my kinda life
My kinda life, yes and I like it
That's been my kinda life yeah
And I wouldn't spend it anywhere
Other than sittin' down somewhere
Playin' away my days, yeah
My kinda life, yeah
My kinda life, yeah
My kinda life, yeah
...




 Refrain:
The cances you gave me
A definite maybe
But luck she's a lady, stayed
She played for me
There's gold in the mountain
Good fortune for countin'
Three coins in the fountain
And my luck won't change
Take dust from the coalmine
Make dust from the goldmine
King Midas you're sidelined
And my luck won't change no my luck remains
Chorus:
No point in shouting
Whoever there was doudting
I'm at the top of the mountain
And my luck won't change
The stock market read it
The rumours they spread it
And I meant it when I said it
That my luck won't change
No my luck remains
That old lover lost me
She spent and she cost me
My new love has taught me
That my luck won't change
(My luck won't change-my luck remains)
Refrain:
The offer she made me
Was more than just maybe
But luck who's a lady stayed
She played for me
Repeat 1st verse
Chorus:
My Temperature's rising
No point in disguising
The Phoenix is arising
And my luck won't change-no it just remains
My luck, my luck won't change




 Well, I've dreamed about today
The same dream in many ways
But I never thought I'd be here
Be here with you, my pretty one
Well, I've searched the whole world through
To find someone who
Would make this dream come true
It's you and only you, my pretty one
Pretty one, I long to hold you
Through the night, I want to hold you
Pretty one, has no one told you
I love you?
Any day and you will find me
Full of joy when you're beside me
In a moment like this
Could it be what I've missed all my life
Well, I've dreamed about today
The same dream in so many ways
But nothing can compare with
Compare with you, my pretty one
Well, I love your smile and I love your eyes
And the way you talk makes me feel so nice
Nothing can compare with the way you are
And I need you now, as I write this song
Did I hear you say you're the only woman?
From a lonely prayer I am in the air
Well, I've dreamed about today
The same dream in so many ways
But nothing can compare with
Compare with you, my pretty one
But I never thought I'd be here
Be here with you, my pretty one
Pretty one, I long to hold you
Through the night, I want to hold you
Pretty one, has no one told you
I love you?
Any day and you will find me
Full of joy when you're beside me
In a moment like this
Could it be what I've missed all my life
Well, I've dreamed about today
The same dream in so many ways
But nothing can compare with
Compare with you, my pretty one
No, nothing can compare with
Compare with you, my pretty one




 There'll never be anyone else but you for me
Never ever be just couldn't be
Anyone else but you
If I could take my pick of all the girls
I've ever known
Then I'd come and pick you out to be my very own
There'll never be anyone else but you for me
Never ever be just couldn't be
Anyone else but you
I never will forget the way you kissed me
And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me
'Cause I hope and I pray the day will come
When you belong to me then I am gonna prove to you
How true my love can be
I never will forget the way you kissed me
And when we're not together I wonder if you miss me
Cause I hope and I pray the day will come
When you'll belong to me
'Cause then I'm gonna prove to you




 I've had my chances, too many nights
All these broken dreams, they're just drifting away
But I'd do it all again, just to hear, hear you say
Chorus:
Never let never let you go
I will never let never let you go
I will never let never let you go
Everyone tells me I'm a fool to myself
But I never listen to a word that they say
'Cause I've heard it a million times before
And I'd give everything away if you will say
Repeat Chorus
Never ever let
Tell me that you'll never let you go
Say you'll not leave me baby
Never let
Never ever let you go
I will never let
Never let you go




 Paroles de la chanson Never Mind :
Well, never mind about your big blue eyes
Never mind about your little white lies
Never mind about the way you cheat at me
But girl, I'll always love you, you will see
That I'll never love another than your caress
Never ever worry about all the rest
Never ever worry you can act untrue
'Cause baby, baby, baby, I'm in love with you
Can you remember when you broke a date and nearly broke my heart
Can you remember how it feels when you're passing those remarks
Well, I've never, never, never, never ever mind
You carryin' on lying and you act unkind
If I tell you conselation, baby, you will find
It won't be me who's saying, never mind
Well, never mind about your big blue eyes
Never mind about your little white lies
Never mind about the way you cheat at me
But girl, I'll always love you, you will see
That I'll never love another than your caress
Never ever worry about all the rest
Never ever worry you can act untrue
'Cause baby, baby, baby, I'm in love with you
Can you remember when you broke a date and nearly broke my heart
Can you remember how it feels when you're passing those remarks
Well, I've never, never, never, never ever mind
You carryin' on lying and you act unkind
If I tell you conselation, baby, you will find
It won't be me who's saying, never mind




 You look so sad - like you lost your only friend
Don't feel so bad - you can always try again
So don't hide, go seek, don't let the grass grow
Under your feet
Get out, get up, get on, get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight
You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in you
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do is
Give a little bit more
She said goodbye
So tell yourself that's all
(That's all, she's gone)

Why you make yourself so small (don't think so small)

Give a little bit more
Don't give up the fight - you gotta keep on
Going with all you might
Try hard don't stop - gotta keep on giving it
All you got
Never give up - never give up - never say die
Believe in, can reach the top
Gotta give it a shot don't say no gotta
Get in the flow
So don't hide go seek
Don't runaway - get back on your feet
Get out - get up - get on - get moving out
Don't surrender - don't give up the fight
You give a little bit more
If you want her back - it's a full attack
You give a little bit more
And if you wanna win you don't give in
Give a little bit more
When you think you're through what you gotta do
Give a little bit more

 Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you
Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
Its no matter darling where you are
I think of you
Day and night, night and day, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffics boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Day and night, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And this torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day




 At the night is so lonely
And of dream of you only
You were the star in my heavens above
I looked for you and found my own true love
I love you, honest I do
And I’m telling you
The night is so lonely
And of dream of you only
You were the star in my heaven above
I looked for you and found my own true love
I love you, honest that’s true
And I’m telling you
The night is so lonely
And of dream of you only
Only, only




 Nine times out of ten, baby, I've told you
And I ain't gonna tell you just nine times again
Aah, just how much I aim to hold you
Again and again and again
Little girl, its nine times out of ten, you've refused me
And then say that you refuse me nine times again
But I won't stop until you choose me
Again and again and again
(Well,) don't try to fight it
Cause its no use
Youre gonna find that
I'm stubborn as a doggone mule
Nine times out of ten I've tried to kiss you
And I ain't trying just nine times again
Well, if I missed the nine times that I've tried, baby
Ill bet my life, Ill get you on number ten
(instr break)
Well, don't try to fight it
Come, baby, it ain't no use
Youre gonna find that
I'm stubborn as a doggone mule
Nine times out of ten I've tried to kiss you
And I ain't trying just nine times again
Well, if I missed the nine times that I've tried, baby
Ill bet my life, Ill get you on number ten

 I don't know how to love you
Where do I begin
It helplessness is sinning
Then here I am a sinner
Guilty of sin
I don't know how to help you
Your trouble goes so deep
You're about to lose your life
And here I am dejected
Cause I love a night of sleep
Love one another you said
Come together as one
I'm just a servant, Lord
Yet you made me a son
Sometimes I'm troubled
By the things you make me see
But no matter how I feel, Lord
Here am I send me
So I leave the world behind me
And enter this domain
I'm staggered by the gulf
Between us
I can see your sickness
But I don't feel your pain
Pity's got no power
Compassion has the heart
Jesus, keep me mindful
That it's you who does the
Giving
And it's we who need to
Play our part




 Across the wet November night
The church is bright with candlelight
And waiting Evensong, (2x)
A single bell with plaintive strokes
Pleads louder than the stirring oaks
The leafless lanes along. (2x)
It calls the choirboys from their tea
And villagers, the two or three
Damp down the kitchen fire (2x)
Let out the cat, and up the lane
Go paddling through the gentle rain
Of misty Oxfordshire (2x)
On country morning sharp and clear
The penitent in faith draw near
And kneeling here below (2x)
Partake the heavenly banquet spread
Of sacramental Wine and Bread
And Jesus' presence know (2x)
And must that plaintive bell in vain
Plead loud along the dripping lane?
And must the building fall? (2x)
Not while we love the church and live
And of our charity will give
Our much, our more, our all (2x)




 You say you'd really like to know me
Why don't we meet and you will show me
Here's the note you hope I'll read it
Take your number if I need it
Someone said it's hard to find out
What it is I think about
I'm good at smiles and easy phrases
Don't look too close I don't like gazes
Now you see me, now you don't
Understand me then you won't
I'm in vision I'm on stage
I'm 17 I don't look my age
I share a word you know I mean it
You give a smile you know I've seen it
Across the rooms our eyes keep meeting
Music is my special greeting
Another night, another town
It's all so quick, it spins me round
Now you see me, now you don't
Understand me then you won't
I'm in vision I'm on stage
I'm 17 I don't look my age




 Love, can't you see I'm alone
Can't you give this fool a chance
A little love is all I ask
A little kindness in the night
Please don't leave me behind
No, don't tell me love is blind
A little love is all I ask
And that is all
Ooh love, I've been searchin' so long
I've been searchin' high and low
And little love is all I ask
A little sadness when you go
Maybe you'll need a friend
Only please don't let's pretend
A little love is all I ask
And that is all
I wanna spread my wings
But I just can't fly
As a string of pearls
The pretty girls go sailin' by
Ocean deep
I'm so afraid to show my feelings
I have sailed a million ceilings
Solitary room
Ocean deep
Will I ever find a lover
Maybe she has found another
And as I cry myself to sleep
I know this love of mine I'll keep
Ocean deep
Now, can't you hear when I call
Can't you hear a word I say
A little love is all I ask
A little feelin' when we touch
Why am I still alone
I've got a heart without a home
A little love is all I ask
And that is all
I wanna spread my wings
But I just can't fly
As a string of pearls
The pretty girls go sailin' by
Ocean deep
I'm so afraid to show my feelings
I have sailed a million ceilings
Solitary room
Ocean deep
Will I ever find a lover
Maybe she has found another
And as I cry myself to sleep
I know this love of mine I'll keep
Ocean deep
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely (Ocean deep)
On my own in my room
I'm so lonely
(Ocean deep)
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
This love of mine
I'll be ocean deep
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
In my room




 Oh no, don't let go - all I need is a little more time
Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine
I just need some time
Give me a little more time - so don't let go
Oh well night after night I'm a little confused
I can't seem to get it right still I might
With a little assistance and a piece of your love
Get closer to your heart
Well at least it would be a start - so don't let go
Oh no, don't let go - all I need is a little more time
Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine
I just need some time
Give me a little more time - so don't let go
Well I'll try - I mean I will attempt to negotiate
This little incline -
Whoops there's a hill and another spectacular chance
For me to be -
Once again with you and I know I'll make it through
So don't let go
Oh no, don't let go - all I need is a little more time
Oh no, don't let go - everything is gonna be fine
I just need some time
Give me a little more time - so don't let go




 I think of this - most every night
How hard it is to get it alright
I'm lookin' here and I'm lookin' there
I see heart broken pieces everywhere
Wouldn't you try wouldn't you know
Try so hard still you let it all go
Too much trouble too much pain
I think I'm gonna have that luck again
What'll I do if you walk away
What'll I do if you walk away
Well I haven't a chance
No I haven't a chance
Once in a while I get this feelin'
Now and again I'm all in a daze
Time after time I ask myself this
Will you walk away?
Once in a while I get this feelin'
Seems all day and night time too
I don't belong I'm just passin' through
I guess you're right I think too much
Still in all - I miss your touch
A crazy notion a careless thought
I start to worry and time gets short
Well think of this my dear young one
The time to act has just begun
What'll I do if you walk away
What'll I do if you walk away
Well I haven't a chance
No I haven't a chance




 This love has two stories
One yours and one sublime
This love has two beginnings
One mine and one unkind
This love has one pretender
This love is to remember
This love had two stories
Must end with once upon a time
There were two strangers
And in time, the strangers met
And fell in love with time
In oh such danger
And time, does not forget
In the meantime
That's the way it goes
Meanwhile, once upon a time
In the meantime, meanwhile
This love has two meanings
One sure and one to find
This love has true feelings
One yearning, one is blind
This love should not surrender
This love is to remember
This love with two meanings
Must end with once upon a time
There were two strangers
And in time, the strangers met
And fell in love with time
In oh such danger
And time, does not forget
In the meantime
That's the way it goes
Meanwhile, once upon a time
In the meantime, meanwhile
That's the way it goes
Once upon a time
In the meantime
This love has one pretender
This love will always remember
This love with two stories
Must end with once upon a time
There were two strangers
And in time, the strangers met
And fell in love with time
In oh such danger
And time, does not forget
In the meantime
That's the way it goes
Meanwhile, once upon a time
This love had one pretender
That's the way it goes
This love will always be mine
This love was once upon a time
This love had one pretender
That's the way it goes
That's the way it has to be
This love will always be mine
Always you, always me
This love had one pretender
That's the way it goes
The way its gotta be




 One fine day, you'll look at me
And you will know our love was, meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
The arms I long for, will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me, right by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting, and, someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down
Oh!
One fine day, we'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl




 Just give me one more sunny day
Bring one more summer breeze my way
One more blue sky to call mine
Come on, just let it shine
So what did I learn from the Ferris wheel
Had a view from the top
Should have known it would stop some day
Never forgot how it made me feel
But a ticket to ride never buys the same high as the fall
Still you never stop longing for more
Just give me one more sunny day
Bring one more summer breeze my way
One more blue sky to call mine
Come on, just let it shine
Where did we go when we just drove around
Top down, radio up, can't you see us now
Whatever happened to the plans we made
Why did we wait it's never to late
Don't let go of your dreams
No matter how dark it seems
Just give me one more sunny day
Bring one more summer breeze my way
One more blue sky to call mine
Come on, just let it shine
Wouldn't it be so fine
Just open up our minds
And it's summer time
Oh yeah
Just give me one more sunny day
Ooh ooh
Just give me one more sunny day
Hey hey
Just give me one more sunny day
Bring one more summer breeze my way
One more blue sky to call mine
Come on, just let it shine
Hey hey give me one more sunny day
Hey hey yeah yeah come on just let it shine
With a blue sky to call mine




 A man's supposed to be a mountain
With the rivers runnin' to the sea
But ever since I lost my baby
I'm not sure that's how it's supposed to be
No need to try and hide this empty feelin'
It's hard to smile when I'm so sad
God's got so many angels up in heaven
Why'd he take the only angel
The only angel I've ever had
I ever had
Now I know you don't hear me darlin'
Still I want to take this time to say
How much I truly loved you
And how sorry I am, sorry I am you went away
No need to try and hide it
Yeah I'm broken hearted and sad
'Cause God's got so many angels up in heaven
Why'd he take the only angel
The only angel I've ever had
I ever had
I just can't hide this empty feelin'
When everybody knows that I'm sad
God's got so many angels up in heaven
Why'd he take the only angel
The only angel I've ever had
I ever had
(He took the only angel) I ever had
(The only angel) I've ever had
(He took the only angel) I ever had




 (On my word)
There will never be anyone but you child
(On my word)
No one else will ever do but you
(On my word)
I will never stay from your side
And someday youre gonna be my bride
(On my word)
They say Im the cheatin guy
They say looking girl youll find someone new
So someone new keeps in my heart
But dont believe them cause I know
That deep inside they love you too, honey
(Repeat the 1st verse)
Umm, they say that I am no good
They say that I never would stand by you
So someday when youre givin me
But dont believe them cause I know
That deep inside they love you too, honey
(Repeat the 1st verse again)




 I can think of nothing better
Than dancing on the beach
See a girl, you can go and get her
Your troubles will be out of reach
(On the beach) You can dance to a rock 'n' roll
(On the beach) Hear the Bossa Nova, played with soul
(On the beach) You can dance, twist and shout
(On the beach) Everybody hear me come on out
On the beach (Come on, everybody, stomp your feet)
On the beach (You can dance with anyone you meet)
'Cause your troubles are out of reach
On the beach
Umm, this is fun
Umm, won't you tell me
I'm the one you're gonna dance with
Yeah, Bossa Nova!
Umm, this is fun
Umm, now I know
I'm the one you're gonna dance with
Yeah, twist and shout now!
You can do the dance that you want to
With anyone that you meet
And if the Bossa Nova doesn't get you
The twist will have you on you feet
(On the beach) You can dance to a rock 'n' roll
(On the beach) Hear the Bossa Nova, played with soul
(On the beach) You can dance, twist and shout
(On the beach) Everybody hear me come on out
On the beach (Come on, everybody, stomp your feet)
On the beach (You can dance with anyone you meet)
'Cause your troubles are out of reach
On the beach




 Someone else is in your arms tonight
While Im all alone and blue
Someone else would kiss and hold you tight
Just the way I used to do
I used to be your love
And now I'm your used to be
Outsider, that's me
Youll be dancing cheek to cheek with him
To our favorite melody
And the tender words you speak to him
Would be words you spoke to me
Once I was in your heart
Now some else holds the key
Outsider, thats me
I want you so much
(So much)
I can look
(You can look)
But mustnt touch
I keep waiting for the phone to ring
But I know its all in vain
When you left me you took everything
Just the memory and the pain
I used to be your love
And now I'm your used to be
Outsider, that's me
Outsider, er that's me




 Don't wanna be left behind left alone
Waiting for you to call me
Don't wanna have best of times haunting me
Underlining my heartache
Time heals but only time will tell if time heals
Leaving me free of the hold that you have on me
Over you how can I get
Over you must forget
The things you do
I just must get
Over you live my life again
Without you here
I talk to your answer phone it's telling me
Please leave your number
I'll call when I get back home
When you hear the tone speak up and clearly
Time heals but only time will tell if time heals
But who do I turn to if you won't return my calls
Over you how can I get
Over you must forget
The things you do
I just must get
Over you live my life again
Without you here
I call your home and your answer phone
Tells me leave your number
Over you how can I get
Over you must forget
The things you do
I just must get
Over you live my life again
Without you here
Over you I just must get
Over you but how will I get
Over you I guess I'll get
Over you it may take some time getting
Over you I may never get
Over you just must get
Over you...




 Go swiftly
The flags and drums can hypnotise
When glory has faded the dream
Is worth more than the prize
A twisting turning flame
And a freedom burning bright
Knows all of the names
And all of the games
Of the yellow black and white
We've gotta have faith
To work it out
Faith and hope
Without any doubt
Give us strenght to make a start
Put a song in our hearts...
Chorus:
We're never gonna break down these walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cos you and I know what love is worth
We're gonna build heaven on earth
We're running in the wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
We're gonna take love and make it shine
We're gonna find peace in our time
Softly, softly
When there is lightening in the sky
When the rivers are rising and
Trouble rolls in on the tide
We'll keep on keeping on
'Til all the tears are dry
We'll weather the storm and
Welcome the dawn
Of tomorrow you and I
We've gotta have faith
And get it fast, faith and hope
And make it last
Give us strength
To reach the stars
Put a song in our hearts
We're never gonna break down these walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cos you and I know what love is worth
We're gonna build heaven on earth
We're running in the wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
We're gonna take love and make it shine
We're gonna find peace in our time
We're raisin' the dust
It's heaven or bust
And we'll see this dream come true
We're gonna have faith...(faith)
The road will be long
But there's hope...(hope)
To carry us on
We'll have strength...(strength)
We'll never go wrong
With this song in our hearts
We're never gonna break down these walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cos you and I know what love is worth
We're gonna build heaven on earth
We're running in the wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
We're gonna take love and make it shine
We're gonna find peace in our time
At the sign (sign)
Of the dove
It's gonna shine (shine)
Shine (shine)
Shine (shine)
On a wing
And a prayer
We'll be fine
Fine
Fine
We're never gonna break down these walls
And build a prison with the stone
'Cos you and I know what love is worth
We're gonna build heaven on earth
We're running in the wheels of fortune
Turning water into wine
We're gonna take love and make it shine
We're gonna find peace in our time




 This couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever
But never, never, again
Again, this couldn't happen again
This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear
What matters, dear, for when
This doesn't happen again
We'll have this moment forever




 I know that you're with him just now as I write
I know you need someone to hold you at night
But I'm begging you, baby, please don't fall in love
I knew it might happen when I was away
And now that it's happened, I just want to say
That I'm begging you, baby, please don't fall in love
I'm usually strong but I'm feeling so weak
It wells up inside me, I cry when I speak
But the more I call you on the phone
The more I feel alone and the less we have to say
I know that you're with him just now as I write
I know you need someone to hold you at night
But I'm begging you, baby, please don't fall in love
I knew it might happen when I was away
And now that it's happened, I just want to say
That I'm begging you, baby, please don't fall in love
We kissed at the airport, we said we could wait
I believe it is we who determine our fate
And I love you more than I can say
Don't throw it all away, don't let it go by
I know that you're with him just now as I write
I know you need someone to hold you at night
But I'm begging you, baby, please don't fall in love
I know you don't tell me, to spare me the pain
Don't want you to tell me, I don't need his name
But I'm begging you, baby, please don't fall in love




 Two sad faces tell the story
Heard so many times before
He is leaving she is staying
Neither of them know what for
There's no laughter there's no crying
There is love there's no denying
Differences led to goodbye and please remember me
And she said-I've got phone and a mail box
A front door that's unlocked
A faith in the feelings there'll be someone you forgot
True I'm gonna miss you, true I'm gonna need you
You know I'm not the one to worry
Oh but I heard the weather report
It says it's gonna be cold and lonely
So honey won't you please remember me
I'm the one that loves you
Please remember me
I'm the one that cares
Please remember me
I'll be thinking of you
And should you ever decide you wanna come home
I'll be there
This is like that old love story
Those who've lost love know it's true
She's sitting by a window waiting
He's sitting somewhere wonderin' what to do
They know they should be together
They know they should reconcile
He knew he would regret her saying please remember me
She said-You've got a home and a warm bed
A roof over your head
A place in my heart for someone i'll never forget
True I'm gonna miss you, true I'm gonna need you
You know I'm not the one to worry
Oh but I heard the weather report
It says it's gonna be cold and lonely
So honey won't you please remember me
I'm the one that loves you
Please remember me
I'm the one that cares
Please remember me
I'll be thinking of you
And should you ever decide you wanna come home
I'll be there
Oh lover won't you please remember
Won't you please remember me
Ooh lover won't you please remember
Won't you please remember me




 Poetry in motion
Walkin' by my side
Her lovely locomotion
Poetry in motion
Walkin' by my side
Her lovely locomotion
Keeps my eyes open wide
Poetry in motion
See her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean
Could never move that way
I love every movement
There's nothing I would change
She doesn't need improvement
She's much too nice to rearrange
Poetry in motion
Dancing close to me
A flower of devotion
A swaying gracefully
Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whooooooooa
When I see my baby
What do I see
Poetry
Poetry in motion
Poetry in motion
See her gentle sway
A wave out on the ocean
Could never move that way
I love every movement
And there's nothing I would change
There's no need improvement
She's much too nice to rearrange
Poetry in motion
All that I adore
No number-nine love potion
Could make me love her more
Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whooooooooa
Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whooooooooa
She's poetry




 It won't work, poor boy, don't you try again
Fate took away your love and you can't win
You can sing the blues all to yourself
But while you're singing
She's with someone else, poor boy
While you're singing she's with someone else
Poor boy, I'm sorry you're so blue
But don't forget there's more than one of you
Poor boy, I'm sorry, you're so sad
Time will heal the pain won't be so bad, poor boy
Time will heal the pain won't be so bad
Let's forget it, poor boy and let's ride alright
Bad luck can be good luck in disguise
Someday new love may come to call
Poor boy, we'll be rich men after all, poor boy
We'll be rich men after all




 Power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me
There's one old man
Spent his life growing flowers
Caring for the bees
Power to the bees
There's one old lady
Spent her days making wine
The wine tasted fine
Power to the vine
Power to the boys who played rock 'n' roll
And made my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before
And those I've yet to meet
Power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me
There's one strong man
Ploughing in the valley
He's living off the land
Power to the land
There's some young girl
Laying down in Monte Carlo
Laying in the sun
Power to the sun
Power to the boys who played rock 'n' roll
And made my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before
And those I've yet to meet
Power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me
Power to the boys who played rock 'n' roll
And made my life so sweet
And to the girls I knew before
And those I've yet to meet
Power to all our friends
To the music that never ends
To the people we want to be
Baby, power to you and me
To the music that never ends
Baby, power to all our friends

 Well here I am out in my make believe world
Makin' believe I'm working
Makin' believe I've got a girl
But inside I know
I'm as real as I wanna be
What if I sailed off to the edges of the sea
Just to see the other side
Just to feel free
And to prove to myself
I'm as real as I wanna be
And even the sky
The sky can't stop me now
Even the sky
The sky can't stop me now
From now on I'm out on the wrong side of the track
Takin' a long look back
And no one can catch me
I'm as real as I wanna be
I'm packing nothing but that which belongs to me
My heart and soul
And the pieces of a dream
I'm gonna make that dream
As real as I wanna be
And even the sky
The sky can't stop me now
Even the sky
The sky can't stop me now
Cause I'm real
And what if I find hate or despair
Oh lord, what if I find nothing there
How could I last
When all that stands beside me
Is the shadow that I cast
And I may come to see the only thing that was true
Was you
Long ago back in this mystery
And I may wish that I could reach back in to pull you
Through
But you'll live on in my memory
In a tear that I will leave behind me
Cause I'm as real as I wanna be
Taken from "Real As I wanna be"-album leaflet by Sunny




 Is...this...me here, really waltzing?
Is this me here, being so square?
Although I know this kind of mu-sic
Makes me sick and you sick
Still I'm aware...
Yeah, it's me here, really waltzing
To a Viennese one-two-three
And if you'll pardon me the simile
I'm a Romberg and Frim'l-y (??)
How can this be me?
BASS VOICE (mock Austrian accent):
I've got zee urge to vear short leather trousers
And dance za vay Strauss-es made their mous-es
CLIFF JOINS IN (with mock accent):
Give me some frau-ses dressed up in cute blouses
Helping their spouses tie bells on their cows-es
CLIFF (with accent):
Oh...here I'm really waltzing
Though I shudder at the idea
And though I really should know better
Here am I in operetta
Really waltzing here
Cliff & full chorus
And...so...we're here, really waltzing
As we take our partners and bow
We say "a plague upon the houses of all the three Strausses"
But, all the same, we must kow-tow
To the rhythm, catchy rhythm
For the violins play and we've got to go with 'em
Yes, we're waltzing, really waltzing
Look at us, really waltzing...now!




 Some-times I will, then again I think I won't
Some-times I will, then again I think I won't
Some- times I do, then again I think I don't
Well, I looked at my watch it was nine twenty one
'twas at a rock 'n' roll dance havin' nothin' but fun
We were rollin' reelin' and a- rockin'
We were reelin' and a- rockin' and rollin' till the break of dawn
Well, I looked at my watch, it was nine thirty-two
There's nothin' I'd rather do than dance with you
We were rollin', reelin' and a-rockin'...
Well, I looked at my watch, it was nine forty-three
And every time I'd spin, she'd spin with me
We were reelin', reelin' and a-rockin', ...)
Well, I looked at my watch, it was nine fifty-four
I said, "Dance ballerina girl, go, go, go! "
We were rollin, reelin' and a-rockin' ...
Well, I looked at my watch, it was ten o-five
Man, I didn't know whether I was dead or alive!
But I was rollin', reelin' and a-rockin'....
Well, I looked at my watch, it was ten twenty-six
But I'm a keep on dancin' till I got my kicks!
We were reelin', reelin' and a- rockin'.....
Well, I looked at my watch, it was ten twenty-eight
I gotta get my kicks before it gets too late!
We were reelin', reelin' and a- rockin' ....
Well, I looked at my watch, it was ten twenty-nine
I had to hold her hand, she was still holdin' mine!
We were reelin', reelin' and a-rockin'. ....
Well, I looked at my watch, and to my surprise
I was dancin' with a woman who was twice my size!
We were reelin', reelin' and a-rockin'. .....
Well, I looked at my watch, and it was time to go
The band leader said, "We ain't playin' no mo' ! "
We were reelin', reelin', and a-rockin'....




 Lately all you can feel is the rain fallin'
Maybe you feel this world is to blame, you've been cryin'
Only, only inside will you know, but still you wonder sometimes
Where can, where can you go?
Remember me. Oh. When you feel this way
And you need someone to lean on
(As if you're ever) Ever too far away
(Remember me) I am the one (remember me) I am the one
Remember me, I am the one who sees in your eyes
Remember me, I am the one who sees in your eyes
Remember me, I am your guardian angel
And I'll never let you fall
And if you're ever, ever in fear or danger
(Remember me) I am the one (Remember Me) I am the one who will turn
Remember me, I am the one...
Turn all your darkness to light in the morning
You learn when you're too hard on yourself, you can call me
Remember me, oh, when you feel this way...
Remember me, I am the one...




 I never thought there could be so much more
You picked me up when I was living down in Egypt
Led me out and opened up the door
When you showed me just how much you thought my heart ment
But I turned and walked away into the wilderness
Now who would have guessed
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away
But now I've got a brand new start
Reunion, reunion of the heart
Now I'm standing n the edge of the land
I want to go out and take all that you gave me
But I'm frightened and you understand
I failed you last time and I don't want a repeat
Still when I'm quiet again I shelter from the noise
I just hear your voice
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I hear you calling my name for a reunion
I thought I'd wandered too far away
But now I've got a brand new start
Reunion, reunion of the heart




 Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
I wonder how we can survive
This romance
But in the end if I'm with you
I'll take the chance
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me goin' crazy
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you




 Well, Saturday night
And I just got paid
Fool about my money
Don't try to save
My heart says
Go, go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night
And, baby, I feel fine

I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
I'm gonna ball it up
I'm gonna lock it up
At the ball tonight
Well, I got me a baby
And I won't be late
Pick her up in my 88
A shag going down
By the social hall
When the joint starts jumping
Gonna have me a ball

Well, along about ten
I'll be flying high
I walk on out to
That groovy sky
But I don't care
If I spend my dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be
One happy soul

Well, Saturday night
And I just got paid
Fool about my money
Don't try to save
My heart says
Go, go, have a time
'Cause it's Saturday night
And, baby, I feel fine

 I'm a rock'n roll juvenile
Watch me run a mile
When they play Beethoven
I'm a rock'n roll groovy mover
I only dig Beethoven
When he's been rolled over
(Roll over Beethoven)
I'm a rock'n roll holy roller
I love to sing 'bout Jesus
Cos he saved my soul-a
I'm a rock'n rolling believer
Roll a rock at the Devil
He's just a deceiver
(Roll the rock)
Look at me, I'm your rock'n roll man
Been a rock'n roll fan since it began
Look at me, follow me if you care
I've found a rock'n roll heaven
I'll take you there
Look at me here I am
Get a rock'n roll band
I am a rock'n roll frontman
Love a solo guitar
It could take you far-take it-take it away




 Ich sah ein schönes Fräulein im letzten Autobus
Sie hat mir so gefallen drum gab ich ihr 'nen Kuß
Es blieb nicht bei dem einen, das fiel mir gar nicht ein
Und hinterher hab ich gesagt, sie soll nicht böse sein
Rote Lippen soll man küssen, denn zum küssen sind sie da
Rote Lippen sind dem siebten Himmel ja so nah
Ich habe dich gesehen und ich habe mir gedacht
So rote Lippen soll man küssen, Tag und Nacht
Heut ist das schöne Fräulein schon lange meine Braut
Und wenn die Eltern es Erlauben werden wir getraut
Jeden Abend will sie wissen, ob das auch so bleibt bei mir
Daß ich sie küsse Tag und Nacht, dann sage ich zu ihr
Rote Lippen soll man küssen, denn zum küssen sind sie da
Rote Lippen sind dem siebten Himmel ja so nah
Ich habe dich gesehen und ich habe mir gedacht
So rote Lippen soll man küssen, Tag und Nacht
Rote Lippen soll man küssen, denn zum küssen sind sie da
Rote Lippen sind dem siebten Himmel ja so nah
Ich habe dich gesehen und ich habe mir gedacht
So rote Lippen soll man küssen, Tag und Nacht




 Wenn einer kommt und sagt dir heut'
Er haette fuer dich immer Zeit
Sag' "No" zu ihm
Und kommt einmal ein reicher Boy
Und er verspricht dir allerlei
Sag' "No" zu ihm
Wenn ich einmal nicht bei dir bin
Da redet man so vieles hin
Ja, so faengt es an
Sie sagen, man hat mich geseh'n
Mit Susi, Evi und Marleen
Und Marianne
(Refr.:)
Darum bitt' ich dich, glaub nur an mich an jedem Tag
Wenn dein Herz versteht, ist alles klar, was ich dir sag'
Wenn einer kommt und dir erklaert
Ich sei nicht einen Heller wert
Sag' "No" zu ihm
Wenn einer sagt, er wuesste schon
Ich laufe dir ja doch davon
Sag' "No" zu ihm
Wenn falsche Freunde von dir geh'n
Sollt' es dir einmal schlecht ergeh'n
Ja das ist nicht schlimm
Denn ich werd' immer treu dir sein
Drum sage jedem andren Nein
Sag' "No" zu ihm
Wenn ich einmal nicht bei dir bin

 Come rest you weary gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Lay down your swords and fight no more
For the sake of Christmas Day
A saviour came down to this earth
To show us everyone
How to live in harmony
Together under the sun
Beyond the dark horizon
Lies a far more bountiful land
Void of all starvation
For every woman and man
So reach out from the wilderness
And pray to heaven above
A future lies in wait for us
A world united in love
We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
Peace on this earth
Through the valleys
Over the hills
Church bells echo their sound
Whispers travelling through the trees
Over the snow covered ground
Spread the message far and wide
So every one can hear
Home fires glow on angel wings
And banishes every tear
We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
Peace on this earth
Grant us.. One wish
No more.. Pain or sorrow
Hear us.. Help us
Build a new tommorrow
So reach out from the wilderness
And pray to heaven above
A future lies in wait for us
A world united in love
We don't need a merry Christmas
We don't need a Happy New Year
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
No more tears or pain at Christmas
No more children living in fear
The only wish on Santa's list
Is that one day there will be
One day there will be
One day there will be
Peace on this earth
Grant us.. Our wish this Christmas

 I feel I'm taking up all of your time
And i still can't work it out, wheter or not you mind
Say you still need my love and I will be strong
Just say that you're O.K. and I'll carry on
Say you don't mind
Well I need to show my love of that I am sure
Just let me feel you close, closer than before
I'm feeling better now, now that you're near
Just let me say the things, the things you want to hear
Say you don't mind
'Cos I'm waking up - been shaken up
And I'm thrilled that I know you
I need to love - can't give enough
And all because you do - everything right to me can't you see
Say you don't mind




 I peeked in to say goodnight
When I heard my child in prayer
"And for me some scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for my hair"
All the stores were closed and shuttered
All the streets were dark and bare
In our town no scarlet ribbons
Not one ribbon for her hair
Through the night my heart was aching
Just before the dawn was breaking
I peeked in and on her bed, in gay profusion lying there
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
If I live to be a hundred
I will never know from where
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons
Scarlet ribbons for her hair
Scarlet ribbons, there's magic in the air
Scarlet, scarlet ribbons for her hair




 Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
You study' em hard and hopin' to pass
Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom's ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open you books
Gee but the teacher don't know
How mean she looks
Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get out of your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long you been wantin' to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
'Round and 'round
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're makin' romance
All day long you been wantin' to dance
Feelin' the music from head to toe
'Round and 'round and 'round you go
'Round and 'round
Hail, hail rock'n'roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock'n'roll
The beat of the drum is loud and bold
Rock rock rock'n'roll
The feelin' is there body and soul




 I'm into Sci-fi (Sci-fi,Sci-fi)
I'm into Sci-fi UFO
I think that I spy (I spy,I spy)
That where I go
The force will go
But these opinions
I keep to myself
I leave my Asimov
Closed on the shelf
Do you dig Einstein? (Einstein,Einstein)
Yeah, but only relatively
Well it's a fine time
To take a bash
At his theories
I think a Star War's
Headed this way
We'll go to Mars
We can work, rest and play
I'm into Sci-fi (Sci-fi,Sci-fi)
I'm into Sci-fi UFO
It's an agent from Mars
And he's calling me from the moon
It's there in the stars
I've got a gig there in June
I'm into Sci-fi (Sci-fi,Sci-fi)
I'm into Sci-fi UFO
I think that I spy (I spy,I spy)
Alien stars on our TV shows
But these opinions I keep to myself
I leave my Asimov closed on the shelf
I'm into Sci-fi (Sci-fi,Sci-fi)
I'm into Sci-fi UFO
And to the Martians I'm gonna say
Hello Hello
I'm into Sci-fi




 Old man rhythm is in my shoes
It's no use sitting and singing the blues
So be my guest you've got nothing to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise

So be my guest you've got nothing to lose
Won't you let me take you on a sea cruise
Oo-ee Oo-ee baby
Oo-ee Oo-ee baby
Oo-ee Oo-ee baby

 'Tho we gotta say goodbye for the summer
Darling I promise you this
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Guess it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams
Every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling you won't be there
I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh let us make a pledge to meet in September
And seal it with a kiss
I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love every day in a letter
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss
Sealed with a kiss




 I've got it! (Got what?)
Got this bus, London Transport said, "OK"
(OK? OK to what?)
OK to use this bus for transport on our holiday
They're with it. (With what?)
With the plan that I have landed them today
(What plan?) (That's right, what plan?)
If we can do it once, they'll back us all the way
7 Days to a holiday and there's such a lot to do
Come on fellas, it's up to you
We're in an awful stew
Get us out of this spot
Are you with us, or not?
6 Days to a holiday, and this bus must look like new
Shiny bright as a birthday gift. Give it a real face-lift
And its body the sheen, of a top beauty queen
5 More days, just 5 more days
To fix up dozens of things
Let's spring-clean it, from front to rear
(Yes, I've cleaned all the springs!)
4 Days to a holiday and we know before we're through
Our bus will be safer than any bank
Tough as an army tank
We will check everywhere, though it's hard to get there
3 Days to a holiday and those sunny skies of blue
By the time that it leaves our shed
Our bus will be bright red
And we know that we will...
(...paint Pa-ree redder still!
Voilà!)
2 Days to a holiday, all of the inside to do
So this old London bus can pass, as a hotel first class
We'll make everything fit
Including...(Ah, yes, that's it)
1 More day, just one more day
So we must not waste an hour
Come on let's get the plumbing in
(Cor, blimey...what a shower!
Off we go on our holiday, and it's you we have to thank...
"Fellas, I cannot thank you enough for helping us with our bus"




 (Yeah-yeah)
I've been searching all over this world
Tried to find me a steady girl
Girl that sweet, kind and true
And then along came you
Oh, naughty girl (oh, naughty girl)
What'd you try to do (what'd you try to do)
Oh, naughty girl, girl, shame on you
(Yeah-yeah)
Let me satisfy your mind
I'm not helpless, I'm not blind
Been around and I know what to do
With a girl like you
Oh, naughty girl (oh, naughty girl)
What'd you try to do (what'd you try to do)
Oh, naughty girl, girl, shame on you
Yeah, you took my heart, can you try to break it
You gave it to me back a-when you know you couldn't make it
Step your feet, pretend to cry (ah-ah-ah...)
Oh, honey why or why?
Oh, naughty girl (oh, naughty girl)
What'd you try to do (what'd you try to do)
Oh, naughty girl, girl, shame on you
(Yeah-yeah)
I tell them you're just ain't no use
You're much better on the loose
Try to none just the fancy free
Just like me
Oh, naughty girl (oh, naughty girl)
What'd you try to do (what'd you try to do)
Oh, naughty girl, girl, shame on you
Yeah-yeah-yeah...




 Hey when you're feeling low
When the blues refuse to let you go
Just reach out for my hand
I can understand
Come share a dream with me
Hey love will found a way
It doesn't matter what the people say
Don't try to hide the way you really feel
Time can only heal
Come share a dream with me
We could rise above all the tears
All the doubts and the fears
We can make a stand here and now
Higher love
Got to learn to trust in a friend
For a peace without end
Oh come share a dream with me
Hey children of the world
Is the dream we're dreaming so absurd
Sweet reason's just a friendly smile away
'cos love is here to stay
Come share a dream with me
We could rise above all the tears
All the doubts and the fears
We can make a stand here and now
Higher love
Got to learn to trust in a friend
For a peace without end
Oh come share a dream with me
We could build castle so tall
Oh the thrill of it all
Won't you find a place in your heart
We could rise above all the tears
All the doubts and the fears
We can make a stand here and now
Higher love
Got to learn to trust in a friend
For a peace without end
Oh come share a dream with me




 She looks at me
Like I'm the only one
Our hearts meet
She moves into mine
I lie there at night
Just hearing her breathing
I taste every breath she takes
I'm her hero she says
But I'm not sure why
She makes me feel like a man
She puts a little bit of heaven in me
I'm so lucky to see her sweet face when I wake
She makes me feel like a man
I can't recall that she
Asked me for anything
As long as I wake by her side
When I hold her real close
Her heart's like racing train
Racing with the beat of mine
But it don't mean a thing
Unless she's with me
She makes me feel like a man
She puts a little bit of heaven in me
I'm so lucky to see her sweet face when I wake
She makes me feel like a man

 Oh well here she comes now oh I'm on the run now
Pretending just pretending that I don't see her
Just to teach her but darling how much longer
Can I keep on living this lie
She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more
Oh she's my world oh not just some girl
Harder it's getting harder to fool anyone
Not just her but I act like a man
She'd expect me to
No tears win her respect
Who am I fooling if I can't fool me
Who believes what their eyes don't see
But I keep on lying
She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more
All my dreams are depending on her
And how good I am at pretending that
She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more
She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more
She means nothing to me
She means nothing to me (haven't you heard)
I'm still as free as a bird
Don't care what you heard about me
She means nothing to me no more




 I hear your accusations darling
And my reply is hard to find
Oh, I wanna know you better
Won't you consider one more time
River flow to shining sea
Mountain nectar blue
Children flow like waterfalls
Sweeter love renew
Peace then war, then peace again
Trial and error true
Oh, if you were to visit there
You would love her too ooooo!
She's so beautiful
She's so kind and free
She's so beautiful
She's all there is to me
(repeat)
Tiny planet spins through space
Gives my life to me
Fifteen billion human beings
Where's our destiny?
Peace then war, then peace again
Trial and error true
Oh, if you were to come down there
You would love her too like I do!
She's so beautiful
She's so kind and freeyeah!
She's so beautiful
She's all there is to me
(repeat 7 times)




 Lord the light or your love is shining
In the midst of the darkness shining
Jesus light of the world shine upon us
Set us free by the truth you now bring us
Shine on me. shine on me
Shine jesus shine
Fill this land with the father's glory
Blaze, spirit blaze
Set our hearts on fire
Flow, river flow
Flood the nations with grace and mercy
Send forth your word
Lord and let there be light
Lord I come to your awesome presence
From the shadows into your radiance
By the blood I may enter your brightness
Search me, try me, consume all my darkness
Shine on me. shine on me
As we gaze on your kindly brightness
So our faces display your likeness
Ever changing from glory to glory
Mirrored here may our lives tell your story
Shine on me. shine on me




 Who can see beyond tonight
I don't know what's wrong or right
But when I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart
Wish I knew a better way
I hate to use an old cliche
But when I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart
I'm just a man of simple words
Living tonight for all it's worth
All I've got is honesty
Touching you is touching me and
When I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart
Yeah when I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart
I'm just a man of simple words
Living tonight for all it's worth
I'm just a man of simple words
Living tonight for all it's worth
All these feelings coming out
The only thing I'm sure about
Is when I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart
When I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart
When I say I love you
I'm shooting from the heart...




 Sometimes I feel you are cheating me
Then you kiss me and my mind is free
But then I think I should let you know that
I've got friends - so baby listen to me....
Chorus:
A shooting star will shoot you and Mars will go to war
The man in the moon will jump on you if you don't love me no more....
I saw you in someone else's car
You told me that - he won't go too far
That may be so but you let him know that
I've got friends, so baby listen to me....
Chorus:
You tell me then I'm the man for you
But you do things you should never do
So now, hear this warning once again, yes
I've got friends, so baby listen to me....
Chorus:
If you don't stop making me lose face
I will have you put up there in space
So, just do what I'm a-telling you, 'cos
I've got friends, baby listen to me....
Chorus:




 Shout
Shout
Let it aloud
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you
Come on
In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Those one track minds
That took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart




 Silent Night, Holy Night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
We've kissed the kids goodnight
We've got their stockings by the fire
A flame lights up the room and hand in hand
We watch it start to snow
The lights glow on the tree
And we drink last hot coffee
Your head's upon my shoulder
And they just played Misletoe and Wine on the radio
Silent Night, Holy Night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace




 Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh what a lovely couple they made
Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste, in the night
Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
"Let me in or else I'll beat down your door"
When two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock, you're on the wrong block
Rushed down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I've never loved you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be, two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days two silhouettes on the shade
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes
Two silhouettes on the shade




 Funny how she still remembers
Those words of love that got him nowhere
Even though she knows he's calling
She never finds the way to show her feelings
She doesn't mind the hours she's keeping
He's waking when she's sleeping
For him it means so much to hear her voice
She's home tonight
Silver's home tonight
And in the morning light
She'll feel much better
Home tonight, She'll stay home tonight
She'll be sleeping light
Till he calls her again
Even though they didn't know it
Standing in the shadow love was waiting
She'd been his friend for such a long time
But never told the boy her heart was breaking
Silver had no way of knowing
That secretly his love was growing
And now he's coming back to stay
She's home tonight
Silver's home tonight
And in the morning light
They're gonna be together
Home tonight, Silver's home tonight
She can hear him saying "I'll never leave you again"
She could only wait
Till the time was right
It was never too late
She's home tonight
Silver's home tonight
And in the morning light
They're gonna be together
Home tonight
Silver's home tonight
She can hear him saying "I'll never leave you again"




 Butterflies danced on invisible strings
Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow
And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain
Furry backed bees with a tireless drone
Never moan, they're happy to be working
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain
Chorus:
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul, before there's nothing left to fly at all
Take to the sky, higher than high, before the silvery rain begins to fall
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields with a silvery rain
Chorus
(Instrumental break)
Chorus




 Sunday morning - it's how you rise
Fuzzy slippers sleep in our eyes
Growin' flowers on the window sill
Yellow daffodils
Conversations - cup of joe
Funny pages in our happy clothes
Ain't got nobody that we got to be
Just you and me
All I know is it's a crazy world
So impossibly complicated girl
That no-one can say what's gonna happen today
All I gotta do is say my name
Every time I think that everybody's gone insane
'cause you know when you're holding me
It's simplicity
Simplicity
Television goin', need no sound
Same old yada yada goin' down
Same old story but a different day
Nothin' ever changes
Nothin's gone change
It's the pouring rain
It's the hurricane
It's the greedy - it's the needy
It's yes indeed no change
All I know is it's a crazy world
So impossibly complicated girl
That no-one can say what's gonna happen today
All you gotta do is say my name
Every time I think that everybody's gone insane
'cause you know girl when you're holding me
It's simplicity
It's simplicity
Girl it's simplicity




 What is there to say
What is there to do
You took another
For your lover
What is there to say or do
Since i lost you
Where is there to go
Who is there to see
Where can i run to
For a new heart
What is there to say or do
Since i lost you
Me and my shadow
Mopin' around
Wond'rin' what to do
He says to leave her
I can't believe her
When she tells me i must go
How much can i stand
Will it never end
My heart is broken
Yes that's true
But, what is there to say or do-oo-oo
Since i lost you




 As I look around me I see the world
In a different light
Everything is changing and it happened
One night
Changing for the better and it starts
With you and me
So we'll sing our song together and forever
We'll be free
Sing a song of freedom
People together everybody sing
Sing a song of freedom each and everyman
People come together all across the land
If you're looking for an answer
It's very close hand
Just take a look around you and
Then you'll understand
Clap your hands together and let
Me hear the sound
It's the time for liberation so pass
The world around




 The weather man, he looks confused
Shakes his fist at the sky like you used to do
But you don't remember things like that, do you?
The balance was uneven but I'm breaking through
Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold
The winter here don't believe in God
The bitter wind just bites through me like a wild dog
I still see in your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog
But one foot in your door, oh that's all I ever got
Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold
Chances are you'll reappear
Swim my way in a flood of tears
No place to hide your conscience
So you're a sinking ship with no place to go
Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold




 Go slow, don't run
Girl, I know the best is yet to come
If you just smile
It makes every single moment worthwhile
You glow, divine
Watcha doin' to this heart of mine
When love comes along
Ain't no question if it's right or wrong
We're holding on
Till the snow falls on the Sahara
And the sun freezes over
When the Mojave red turns into blue
When my lungs get tired of breathing
And my heart stops its beating
I'll stop loving you
No rush, cause I'll wait
Love is timeless, there's no being late
You should know, always there
Till the last day of forever, I swear
I'll be there
Till the snow falls on the Sahara
And the sun freezes over
When the Mojave red turns into blue
When my lungs get tired of breathing
And my heart stops its beating
I'll stop loving you
And it's gonna be a long time
Till the snow falls on the Sahara
And the sun freezes over
No snow
When the Mojave red turns into blue
No lights
When the music's no longer playing
And the faithless start praying
I'll stop loving you
I don't want to miss a single heartbeat
But sometimes the words get in the way
But I hear your voice just fine
And it's gonna be a long time
Till the snow falls on the Sahara
And the sun freezes over
No snow
When the Mojave red turns into blue
No lights
When the music's no longer playing
And the faithless start praying
I'll stop loving you




 Some people they tease one another
Take pride in themselves
Keeping the other one down
Well, I'm not like that at all
Some people they hurt one another
They love to see
Hurt in the other one's eyes
Well, I'm not like that at all
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk
Holding the other one's hand
They always understand!
Some people cry
Some people know why
Ohoho
Ahaha
Some people they use one another
So aimlessly
Not like lovers do
Well, I'm not like that at all
Some people they long for each other
They love to talk
Holding the other one's hand
They always understand!
Some people cry
Some people know why
With a word unspoken
With a voice unheard
When a thought is broken by a tender word
When a heart is moved
When a heart is thrown
The silence tells you you're not alone
Some people are born for each other
They love to walk
Holding the other one's hand
They always understand
Some people cry
Some people know why
Some people
(Some people are born for each other)
They love to walk
Holding the other one
(Some people are born for each other)
They love to talk
Holding the other one
(Some people are born for each other)
They love to walk
Holding the other one
Holding the other one
Holding each other




 I have seen you smile
At the accidental touch of my hand
A secret grin
There's a covert light in your eyes
When I walk in the room
Yeah I caught you
Babe you can't run from the truth
You cannot tell me a lie
'cause girl you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Somethin' is goin' on
I have felt my heart skip a beat
At the sound of your name
I turn away
'cause you can read my bad poetry
That I've tried to erase
But it's written on my face
I cannot run from the truth
And I don't believe in lies
But girl you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Somethin' is goin' on
On top of some mountain
I'll scream it, I'll shout it
I love you, you love me
How can that be wrong
Somethin' is goin' on
I cannot run from the truth
And I don't believe in lies
Girl you have to show me why
This thing will not work
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Somethin' is goin' on
Girl you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Somethin' is goin' on




 Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I have seen you smile
At the accidental touch of my hand
A secret grin
There's a covert light in your eyes
When I walk in the room
Yeah, I caught you
Babe, you can't run from the truth
You cannot tell me a lie
'Cause girl you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Somethin' is goin' on, yeah
I have felt my heart skip a beat
At the sound of your name

You can read my bad poetry
That I've tried to erase
But it's written on my face
I cannot run from the truth
And I don't believe in lies
But girl, you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Somethin' is goin' on
On top of some mountain
I'll scream it, I'll shout that
I love you, you love me
How can that be wrong?
Somethin' is goin' on, yes it is
Somethin' is goin' on
Somethin' is
I cannot run from the truth
And I don't believe in lies
But girl, you have to show me why
This thing will not work
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong
Hey girl, you have to show me why
This is not our time
When all the evidence is sayin' that you're wrong, yeah
Somethin' is goin' on, yeah
You know it is
You know it is
Somethin' is goin' on
Somethin' is goin' on
You and me, babe
You know somethin' is goin'
Somethin' is, somethin' is
Somethin's going on, somethin' is
How can that be wrong?
'Cause somethin' is, somethin' is
Somethin' is goin' on
'Cause somethin' is goin' on




 Sometimes love is like a loaded gun
Sometimes the best thing to do is run
Sometimes love is like a rolling dice
Sometimes it's a seven, sometimes snake eyes
You know it's not for those afraid to risk it
Play it safe and you're sure to miss it
It's for those of us who love to gamble
So lay your bets down
Sometimes love is like an ace high straight
You could lose your shirt or you could win the day
Sometimes love is like a runaway train
You might survive it but the odds aren't great
If it makes you nervous don't ya sweat it son
Don't ya know the danger's half the fun
So take a deep breath and hold on tight
Just strap yourself in and enjoy the ride




 Oooooo...
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
They fly over the rainbow
Why then - oh, why can't I?
I see trees of green, red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Well, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
The brightness of day and light, darkness of night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passin' by
I see friends shakin' hands, saying "How do you do!"
They're really sayin' "I love you."
I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then - oh, why can't I?
Oooooo...




 Eight o'clock and it's way past time
Feelin' good I'm gonna make it tonight
It's so good when you feel this right
Out here underneath the spotlight
I'm not lonely, not lonely, not lonely
'Cos I'm doing it right
You see I put my heart in His hand, I'm a son of thunder
Underneath the spotlight
So many fall at the break of day
But I'm a winner come what may
'Cos it matters 'bout the way you choose
Choose Him and you just can't lose
It's not lonely, not lonely, not lonely
When you're doin' it right
Why don't you put your heart in His hand, be a son of thunder
Underneath the spotlight
Put yourself in my place it would be a disgrace
Left with egg all over your face
Would you come back so soon if I sang out of tune
I could be howlin' at the moon
You can see me tonight standing under the light
And I'll be singing a song that's true
Maybe someday you'll find that you're no longer blind
And the light will sing for you
Twelve o'clock and I'm on my way
Another town, it's another day
Got a message that you just can't buy
I've got to tell it and that is why
I'm not lonely, not lonely, not lonely
'Cos I'm doing it right
You see I put my heart in His hand, I'm a son of thunder
Underneath the spotlight




 There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one
That never sees the sun
And only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
I'm goin' to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In my garden
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal
That look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon
I'm goin' to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In my garden
With eyes as black as coal
That look down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon
I'm goin' to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In my garden
I'm goin' to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In my garden
In Spanish Harlem




 He's the footsteps in the night
Shadows gone before the light
Never get to see the face
Of spider man
Catcing flies just ain't his style
If you're crooked stop think awhile
Once bitten - never the same
He makes a black widow look tame
Spider man
He spins a golden web
With a golden thread
That never, never let's him down, down, down
And when the spidercatcher comes to town
He ain't around
Solo
If you're walking in the park
And hear a shuffling in the dark
Don't stop to give it a glance
You know there's a pretty good chance
It's spider man, spider man
Once bitten never the same
He makes a black widow look tame
Spider man




 Well, I heard you weren't stayin'
Heard you weren't stayin' around
That someone has gotten to you
Something 'bout a new kid in town
Well, stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened in love
But the more I think about it
The more I see that you are a victim of
Well, don't believe everything they say
They're only jealous of you
How people talk when they don't know the truth
Don't ever let them get to you
My love is stronger than that
My love is poetry in motion
My love is deeper than that
My love is deeper than the ocean
Well, if anyone should harm you
Anyone should get in your way
And you need someone to talk to
Please call me right away, right away
Let them all listen
Listen to the new kid in town
Well, it's the same old story
The story's been around and around
So don't believe everything they say
They're only jealous of you
How people talk when they don't know the truth
Don't ever let them tell you what to do
My love is stronger than that
My love is poetry in motion
My love is deeper than that
My love is deeper than the ocean
And it's gettin' deeper
And it's gettin' stronger
So don't believe everything they say
They're only jealous of you
How people talk when they don't know the truth
Don't ever let them tell you what to do, no
My love is stronger than that
My love is poetry in motion
My love is deeper than that
My love is deeper than the ocean
My love is stronger than that
My love is poetry in motion
My love is deeper than that
My love is deeper than the ocean
Ah, my love is deeper than deeper
My love is gettin' deeper
Deeper and deeper and deeper
My love is gettin deeper, deeper




 It was a night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
The moon was bright oh how so bright
It was a night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
The moon was bright oh how so bright
It was it really was such a night
The night was alight with stars above
When she kissed me
I had to fall in love
It was a kiss oo-oo what a kiss
It was it really was such a kiss
How she could kiss oh what a kiss
It was it really was such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips
And it sets me afire
I reminisce and I'm filled desire
But I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember
Oh, what a night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and my love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget that kiss
The kiss in the moonlight
Oo-oo such a kiss, such a night
I'd gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember
It was a night oo-oo what a night
It was it really was such a night
Came the dawn and my heart and my love
And the night was gone
But I'll never forget that kiss in the moonlight
Oo-oo such a kiss, such a night
Now she's gone, gone, gone
Yes she's gone, gone, gone
Came the dawn, dawn, dawn
And the night was dawn
And my heart love was gone
And her love was gone
But before that dawn
Oo-oo, oo-oo such a night




 Let the day fall all around you
And let the breath of life surround you
What a day it should be a holiday
And these lazy days are hard to come by
Here for our pleasure, a moment to treasure
Stay with me and lend me your company
For you, you show to me all the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we, we could see half he gave us to see
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer
So where will all the seasons go
It's for us to ask, it's for him to know
It's too much for me, for such is the mystery
And all these things we take for granted
But how did they get here, when were they planted?
If we could see, then what would the answer be?
For you, you show to me all the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we, we could be half he wants us to be
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer
Today we'll see butterfly
And we'll smell the grass and we'll feel the sky
Oh what a day, let no one take this away
But I will live my life forever, asking the questions
But answers will never come to me
For such is the mystery
For you, you show to me all the world gives for free
And there's no more that a man can ever ask for
And if we, we could be half he wants us to be
Then we'd be half way to finding the answer




 She walks in I'm suddenly a hero
I'm taken in my hopes begin to rise
Look at me can't you tell I'd be so
Thrilled to see the message in your eyes
You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there
Suddenly the wheels are in motion
And I I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
Cos I I'm ready to take all my chances with you
How can I feel you're all that matters
I'd rely on anything you say
I'll take care that no illusions shatter
If you dare to say what you should say
You make it seem I'm so close to my dream
And then suddenly it's all there
Suddenly the wheels are in motion
And I I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
Cos I I'm ready to take all my chances with you
Why do I feel so alive when you're near
There's no way any hurt can get thru'
Longing to spend every moment of the day with you
Suddenly the wheels are in motion
And I I'm ready to sail any ocean
Suddenly I don't need the answers
Cos I I'm ready to take all my chances with you

 Come into my life and we will walk the road together
Happy with you I know I'll be
Someday you'll find me so that I'll belong to you
Prepare yourself so to receive the love I give you
Happy to share now I'm aware of how much I need you
To be part of me oh can't you see that
Summer rain will come again so the
Harvest is a good one
But if you don't respond to me I am lost
You're the only hope I have to bring
Forth the fruit in season
Now I know I need you to survive
You, you are my dream - you make it seem
So very real
Taking my time, making me rhyme
When I'm walking again to find I cannot see the one
To whom I call - that I may be no more alone again
Happy to share now I'm aware of how much
I need you to be part of me oh can't you see that
Summer rain will come again so the
Harvest is a good one
But if you don't respond to me I am lost
You're the only hope I have to bring
Forth the fruit in season
Now I know I need you to survive

 When Calypso rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor
I’ve got eyes dear to see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I grow weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor
I’ve got eyes dear to see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I grow weak
I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Sway me now, sway me now
Sway me n-o-w




 I hear you say hello
Now is there something the matter
Oh won't you tell me so

Tell me if you're feelin' sad
Nothin' should be quite this bad

Take another look
Please another look
At just who you're talking to tonight
Maybe there's a chance
Please another chance
That we won't be wastin' time tonight
(take another look)
Oh won't you- oh won't you (take another look)
Oh please (take another look)
You wonder for tonight
'cos you say you need to
Well don't you know it's alright
Pretty soon you'll be free to go
Wherever you need to go
But there's something that we both should know
We're playin' (silly games)
Take another look
Please another look
At just who you're talkin' to tonight
Maybe there's a chance
Please another chance
That we won't be wastin' time tonight

 School days are over
Holidays are here
I won’t see my baby
For almost half a year
No holding hands in break time
Kissin’ after school is over
Oh, how I miss her so
Take special care of my baby
See that’s no harm comes to her
I really love her, honest I do
So please take special care of her
Wishing times are here again
I can wish her near
Dream times are here again
I can dream her near
And holing hands in break time
Kissin’ after school is over
Oh, how I miss her so
Take special care of my baby
See that’s no harm comes to her
I really love her, honest I do
So please take special care of her
Take special care, take special c-a-r-e




 Did you see that I've got a lot to learn?
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn -
Oooh, teach me tonight!
Let's start with the ABC of it
Roll right down to the XYZ of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight!
The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star, to write I love you
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear my love
Should the teacher stand so near my love?
Graduation's almost here my love
Oooh, teach me...
Oooh, teach me tonight!




 Way down in the land of sunny Mexico
There's a fellow, I'm sue that you all know
Any time within his trouble there
You bound to hear his cry ringing through the air
Andele y'arriva
Andele y'arriva
In Spanish this means I'm here
Andele, andele, andele y'arriva
One day last May a tourist came to town
And very soon he started hanging 'round
With the Speedy's girl giving her the eye
And suddenly he heard this famous cry
Andele y'arriva
Andele y'arriva
In Spanish this means I'm here
Andele, andele, andele y'arriva
He hit the tourist with the speed of light
And next to no-time he had won the fight
The last words he remembered for his flight
Were: Senor, you're leaving Mexico tonight
Andele y'arriva
Andele y'arriva
In Spanish this means I'm here
Andele, andele, andele y'arriva
So if you ever go to sunny Mexico
Enjoy yourself but be careful how you go
And listen well to everything I say
'Cause I was that tourist there one day last May
Andele y'arriva
Andele y'arriva
In Spanish this means I'm here
Andele, andele, andele y'arriva

 50 years ago a kid stood on the stage
Trying to hold his nerve 'til the moment he heard the music
I can see him now, it's so hard to believe
So many things have changed but one thing stays the same, the music
And I've been blessed to live this life
I gave my best and now it's time to say
Thank you for sharing the story, thank you for being there for me
Even though time doesn't wait it brought you here tonight
I gave you a lifetime but you gave me the time of my life
Back in '58 I started on this road
It seems like yesterday when the band started playing 'Move It'
So many memories, places that I've seen, timeless melodies
It all seems like a dream, it's magic
For every song I've ever sung I wanna say to everyone
Thank you for sharing the story, thank you for being there for me
I'm up here and you're out there, to me it feels just right
I gave you a lifetime and you gave me the time of my life
Thank you for sharing the story, thank you for being there for me
Thank you for the songs you sing with me
Thank you for the love that you gave me
Even if the curtain falls the final time tonight
All I gave you was a lifetime but you gave me the time of my life
Thank you




 To spend one night with you
In our old rendezvous
And reminisce with you
That's my desire
To meet where gypsies play
Down in that dim caf'
And dance till break of day
That's my desire
We'll sip a little glass of wine
And I'll gaze into your eyes divine
I'll feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine
To hear you whisper low
Just when it's time to go
"Cheri, I love you so"
"You're my desire"
Oh...
Cheri, Cheri, Oh...that's my desire




 So many years gone
Still I remember
How did I ever let my heart believe
In one who never gave enough to me
And so many years gone
With love that was so wrong
I can't forget the way it used to be
And how you changed the taste of love for me
You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one moment
I'll always have in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you
And we'll have no ending
If we can hold on
And I think I've come this far because of you
Could be no other love but yours will do
You were my one more chance
I never thought I'd find
You were the one romance
I'll always have in my mind
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
I might have saved the best of me for you
No one will ever touch me more
And I only hope that in return
No matter how much we have to learn
I might have saved the best of me for you
For you, I saved the best of me
You were my one more chance
You were the one romance
You were my one more chance
You were the one romance
You were my one more chance
You were the one romance
You were my one more chance
You were the one romance
You were my one more chance




 Chestnuts roasting on a open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some misletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Altho's it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety two
Altho's it's been said many times many ways
Merry Christmas to you

 Imagine a still summer's day
When nothing is moving, least of all me
I lay on my back in the hay
The warm sun was soothing, it made me feel good
The day I met Marie
The sound of her whisper "hello"
Came tiptoeing softly into my head
I opened my eyes kind of slow
And there she was smiling, it made me feel good
The day I met Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze
I remember her kiss, so soft on my brow
And the way that she said:
"Baby, go to sleep now
Baby, go to sleep now"
I woke with the chill in the air
The warm sun no longer hung in the sky
I reached out but she was not there
She'd gone where she came from but I still feel good
To think I've known Marie
With the laughing eyes
She'd toss her hair and tantalize
She came to touch me then she's gone
Just like a summer breeze




 If you could see you through my eyes
Those doubts would never cross your mind
I wouldn't say forever
If with all my heart I didn't mean it
From now until eternity
Girl believe me I'm not leaving
The day that I stop loving you
Could never come to be
I know that even if the sun and moon
By chance collide
Or space and time should split in two
There will never be the day
That I stop loving you
And in this world so full of change
One truth will constantly remain
I will always be here
So you never need to even ask me
Nothing else compares
To the sweet taste of everlasting
What I say
They're only words
And words could never be enough
To show you all I have to give
Long as we live
We will love without end
The day that I stop loving you
Could never come to be
I know that even if the sun and moon
By chance collide
Or space and time should split in two
There will never be the day
There will never be the day
There will never be the day
That I stop loving you




 The wheels forever spinning
The dice are thrown and scatter
The words are all of winning
But only numbers matter
We bet on our existence
We'll last another round
The lucky go the distance
The losers go to ground
From birth to death we gamble
The lots are daily cast
No warning or preamble
Which one will be your last
There is a great comfort in pure hatred
For envy's not enough, not enough
The soothing joy of malice
Is made of sterner stuff, sterner stuff
The failure of a father
The torment of a son
Is a recipe to justify
The worst that could be done
He'll destroy us unless we call a halt
Should the bastard steal our birthright
It will be our fault
The race is won by cunning
A terrifying dance
Too complex in the running
To leave it all to chance
But chance is all we're given
So chances we must take
The gambler's stake is driven
Through hearts that dare not break
But all save one are broken
As fatal points are scored
And one surviving token
Holds sway across the board
There's a moment when the game's balance
Tilts the other way, the other way
When the odds begin to favour
Outsiders in the play, in the play
The failure of incumbents
The sleazy tricks they use
Mean that those who think they call
The tune can only lose
Deal the cards, it won't matter how they fall
Because nothing is a gamble when you want it all




 If she walks by and the menfolks get engrossed
The girl can't help it
If she winks an eye and bread slices turn to toast
The girl can't help it
She's got a lot of what they call the most
The girl can't help it
The girl can't help it if she was born to please
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
Oh, won't you kindly be aware
The girl can't help it
She mesmerizes every mother's son
The girl can't help it
And if she smiles and rare steaks become well done
The girl can't help it
She makes grandpa feel like twenty-one
The girl can't help it
The girl can't help it if she was born to please
And if I go to her on bended knees
Oh, won't you kindly be aware
That I can't help it
Because I'm hoping, obviously
That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it if she's in love with me




 Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah
(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, he smile - but she doesn't see
(Doesn't see)
(She just doesn't see, she never sees him)




 She locks the bedroom door - Lies face down on the bed
Hears voices down the hall - are they real or in her head
Pictures on the wall - reminders every one
Just memories of the past - of a time that's
Been and gone
All those wild and crazy nights - they still
Dance before her eyes
(Those crazy nights - her name in lights)
Look at her now the golden days are over
Look at her now no leading man to hold her
She was one in a million now she's that
Forgotten face
Look at her now the golden days are over
Applauded by the press - an overnight success
A favourite with the fans - had them eating
From her hands
But stars fall from the sky - in the twinkle
Of an eye
There's no more silver screen just another
Broken dream
Still she strikes a classic pose - just in case
The cameras roll
(She steals the scene - relieves the dream)
Look at her now the golden days are over
Look at her now no leading man to hold her
She was one in a million now she's that
Forgotten face
Look at her now she needs someone to hold her
To feed her lines - someone to co-star
Someone to shine
Look at her now the golden days are over
(The golden days are over - they're over)
Look at her now no leading man to hold her
(No M. G. M. - no Paramount - no 20th Century)
Look at her now the golden days are over
(Decline and fall - no curtain call)




 You are my theme for a dream
Yes you are, a rare and lovely theme
(You're a theme for a dream)
The dreams I dream day and night
That your arms are holding me so tight
(You're a theme for a dream)
When I dream I kiss you
(Kiss you)
Music fills with starlight
(Starlight)
Every time I touch you
(When I touch you)
Each and every time
A chime rings out I love you
Only you for ever more
'Cause you're my theme for a dream
Yes you are, a rare and lovely theme
(You're my theme for a dream)
So, angel please say that you love me too
And make my dreams come true dream
(You're my theme for a dream)
When I dream I kiss you
(Kiss you)
Music fills with starlight
(Starlight)
Every time I touch you
(When I touch you)
Each and every time
A chime rings out I love you
Only you for ever more
'Cause you're my theme for a dream
Yes you are, a rare and lovely theme
(You're my theme for a dream)
So, angel please say that you love me too
And make my dreams come true dream
And make my dreams come true
Please make my dreams come true




 Bells will be ringing
And birds will be singing
If you and your lover should ever discover
That there’s a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet, I’m safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows
There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love
And it’s sweet secret of a summer place
Is that it’s anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes, all their dreams, all their love
And it’s sweet secret of a summer place
Is that it’s anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes, all their dreams, all their love
All there love

 The minute you're gone I cry
The minute you're gone I die
Before you walk out of sight
I'm like a child all alone at night
I stare into emptiness
I'm filled with such loneliness
The world goes from right to wrong
The minute you're gone
The minute you're gone I see
How lonely a man I'd be
My life would be oh so blue
If I couldn't be with you
The minute you're gone I pray
The minute you're gone I say
Please don't stay away too long
The minute you're gone
The minute you're gone I see
How lonely a man I'd be
My life would be oh so blue
If I couldn't be with you
The minute you're gone I pray
The minute you're gone I say
Please don't stay away too long
The minute you're gone

 They say I'll love again someday
A truer love will come my way the next time
But after you there'll never be a next time for me
They say that I'll find happiness
In someone else's warm caress the next time
I'll soon forget your kiss and heartaches such as this
Will just be ancient history
They say that I'm a fool to weep
That I won't go on losing sleep the next time
And someone else will mend the heart you've broken in two
(But) How can I fall in love the next time?
When I'm still so very much in love with you
They say that I'm a fool to weep
That I won't go on losing sleep the next time
And someone else will mend the heart you've broken in two
(Oh) How can I fall in love the next time?
When I'm still so very much in love with you

 It's in the night
That I get that lonesome feeling
Oh, the troubles of the day
Come rushing into my mind
It's in the night
That I start to think about you
And this ache that's in my heart
Gets stronger as time goes by
Morning brings relief from misery
I even manage a smile for friends I see
Darkness falls and then the shades of night
Reach out for me and try to hold me tight
And drag me down, down, down
And then once more
The night and you enfold me
And I'm caught in the web
That you spun when we first fell in love
I can't forget
The way you used to hold me
Will this memory of our love
Keep haunting me
Until the day I die
Solo
Morning brings relief from misery
I even manage a smile for friends I see
Darkness falls and then the shades of night
Reach out for me and try to hold me tight
And drag me down, down, down
And drag me down, down, down, down, down




 I have a burden of pure vengeance
That i was damned with from my birth
And it will the force that drives me
Until the day i quit this earth
You live by treachery and violence
And they will crush you in return
Your destruction is my pleasure
Your spite the fire in which you burn
I'm the true son of our father
And i am lord of wuthering heights
Burn in hell, you filthy gypsy
Share the fate of parasites
I did not love you isabella
You were the means to other ends
I always knew our ailing offspring
Would never pay me dividends
I used to long for you to kill me
But now i wish you death instead
I gave you all this woman could do
I was raped, abandoned, all feelings dead
Spineless edgar, feeble edgar
Catherine wanted only me
I was constant, i was tender
All that you could never be
There's a time for absolution
There's a time for true regret
I knew the envy of a family
Which was so easy to destroy
But oh my cathy not so easy
To be the one you could enjoy
I cannot rest in peace without you
And you could never comprehend
My cold and angry isolation
I wait for you brother, lover, friend
Death it beckons, sister, lover
All i see is your sweet face
Whether man or whether devil
Still the love i can't replace
There is a time for absolution
There is a time for true regret
There is a time to beg forgiveness
But the time is here not yet
I curse the god or man that made me
I curse the life i had to lead
I curse the years ahead without her
I curse my hunger, i curse my need




 Came a time in my life
I had to be free
From all the lies
That used to be me
And the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
I've been waisting my time
But not anymore
I've been through the maze
And it lead to your door
And the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
I spent a lot of time at the crossroads
Getting that lonely feeling inside
Suddenly you stopped the rain and you changed the view
Now every where's leading to you
Let's get this thing going
Let's move it along
Let me do all the things
I've been missing so long
'Cause the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
Ohoho
I spent a lot of time at the crossroads
Getting that lonely feeling inside
Suddenly you made the rescue, you pulled me through
Now let me do something for you
Let's get this thing going
Let's move it along
Let's do all the things
I've been missing so long
And the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
Yeah, the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
Yeah, the only way out
Is the only way in
And it's you
Only way out
Is the only way in
The only way out
Is the only way in
Ahaha
The only way in
Only way out




 Free to run like the wind on a summer day
Heart worn like a ring around the moon
And your eyes are ablaze
Reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life
Than standing still
Or running from place to place in the heat of
The day
Just follow your heart and you'll see ...
There's more to life
There beyond the horizon there's another day
Far above the pain and fear you feel
The power and the pace
The greatest sensation of all
There's much more to life than you'll ever know
The rise and fall, there'll always be you and me
We're moving as one
So follow your heart and you'll see ...
There's more to life
We all have our dreams
We all have our visions
But time after time we're faced with decisions
Which road to follow?
How hard to fight?
Then you wake up and see
That there's more to life
Free in acres of sky on a summer day
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart
We are never apart
Reflections of time passing by
That remind you there's much more to life
So follow your heart and you'll see
If you follow your heart you'll be free
'cos there's more to life
So much more to life
More to life




 No-one can touch you now - no
No-one can harm you, you're finally free
Your passion all spent
Your savage intent
To break away meant to break me
Oh Cathy - the game you played!
Oh Cathy - you've paid
I've been betrayed
I try to find the words to justify
All that you've put me through
What gave you the right
To leave me?
When you
You knew
I loved you
I pray you find some peace at last
The sleep of the good
If only I could
Only my life remains - cold
This is a winter will never know spring
As time and again
I try to contain
The anger and pain that you bring
Oh Cathy my reckless one!
Oh Cathy it's done
The night's begun
You lie so close, so calm, so motionless
I can almost believe
That you're still in my arms
Within me
So near
To hear
I loved you
I pray I find some peace at last
The sleep of the good
If only I could




 You ask how much I need you-ou
Must I explain
I-I need you oh my darlin'
Like roses nee-eed rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I-I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never
I'll still be loving you
Ho-old me close
Never let me go
Ho-ho-old me clo-ose
Me-elt my heart like April snow-ow
I'll love you 'til the blue be-ells
Forget to bloom
I'll love you 'til the clover
Has lost its perfume
I-I'll love you 'til the poe-ets
Run out of rhyme
U-u-until the twelfth of never
And that's a long lo-ong time
Until the twelfth of never
And that's - a - long - long - time...
A long-long time...




 The water is wide I can't cross over
And neither have I got wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I
Oh love is gentle and love is kind
The sweetest flower when first it's new
But the only love never waxing cold
Is the love He offers to me and you
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I
There's a ship and she sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
And even deeper than the love I'm in
If I step on board then our love begins
Got to step on board let our love begin
(Water is wide and I've got to cross over)




 If I listen to you then I'm a winner
If I take you at your word every day
There's nothing that can harm me I'm a winner all the way
If I take notice of what the words tell me
It's not too long before I'm caught out in the rain
You're the only one who can take me back again
Taking me back, making me one with you
Taking me back, making me new
Taking me back, even when I've been done with you
Taking me back, you keep pulling me through
To the love that won't give up - with you
I'm a winner
Here I am I'm a winner
See my world turned it upside down
Maybe know that I'm nothing without you
Got a brand new style of living with a motivation
When I know my way losing my direction
That's when I get hurt with no one else to blame
You're the only one who can heal me taking me back again
Taking me back, making me one with you
Taking me back, making me new
Taking me back, even when I've been done with you
Taking me back, you keep pulling me through
To the love that won't give up here I am a winner
Here I am I'm a winner
If I listen to you then I'm a winner
If I take you at your word every day
There's nothing that can harm me I'm a winner all the way
Taking me back, making me one with you
Taking me back, making me new
Taking me back, even when I've been done with you
Taking me back, you keep pulling me through
To the love that won't give up
You keep taking me back, making me one with you
Taking me back, making me new
Taking me back, even when I've been done with you
Taking me back, you keep pulling me through
To the love that won't give up




 The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No no they can't take that away from me
The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No no they can't take that away from me
We may never never meet again, on that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we dance till three
The way you change my life
No no they can't take that away from me
No they can't take that away from me
Yeah yeah yeah
We may never never meet again, on this bumpy road to love
Still I'll always, always keep the memory of
The way you hold your knife
The way we dance till three
The way you change my life
No no they can't take that away from me
No they can't take that away from me
No they can't take that away from me
No they'll never never never never take that away from me
No they can't take that away...




 The young ones
Darling we're the young ones
And young ones shouldn't be afraid
To live, love
While the flame is strong
For we won't be the young ones very long
Tomorrow
Why wait till tomorrow
Tomorrow sometimes never comes
Love, me
There's a song to be sung
And the best time is to sing while we're young
Once in every lifetime
Comes a love like this
I need you and you need me
Oh my darling can't you see
Young dreams
Should be dreamed together
Young hearts shouldn't be afraid
And some day when the years have flown
Darling, this will teach the young ones of our own
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones
The young ones
Darling, we're the young ones




 I could talk for hours but you wouldn't hear a word
Your own opinions make you blind
There will come a morning when the sand has all run out
There will be no time to change your mind
Like a thief in the night He will come
There will be nowhere left you can run to
You can fall with the night or you can rise
With the son
He will come in glory, a rider in the sky
The lion and the lamb rest side by side
Children of the kingdom, He will gather to himself
Children of the darkness He will leave behind
Like a thief in the night He will come
There will be nowhere left you can run to
You can fall with the night or you can rise
With the son




 I'm gonna find true love
This new year
January blues
The nights are dark and cold
The heartaches are frozen so they hount you
February snows
Abandoned cars and glowing fires
Sunlight from a shining spire blinds you
Don't you depend on love that's here then gone
Don't you look back to where the tears came from
This new year
We're gonna make it work now and for a lifetime
This new year
Gonna spread the word and shout it from the rooftops
Gonna find true love and cherish it, cherish it always
This new year
Cool winds in the spring
Blow the cobwebs out
Take away the doubts with freedom
Hear this beating heart
The feeling so alive
With you right by my side I'll never die lonely
We must depend on love that's here to stay
And Jesus loves you more than you can say
This new year
We're gonna make it work now and for a lifetime
This new year
We're gonna spread the word and shout it from the rooftops
We're gonna find true love and cherish it, cherish it always
We'll see a new revival call yeah
We'll reach out to the broken ones
We'll tell it to the world
To every boy and girl that love has come
This new year
We're gonna find true love
Ooh cherish it
This new year
We're gonna make it work now and for a lifetime
This new year
We're gonna spread the word and shout it from the rooftops
This new year
We 're gonna find true love and cherish it always
This new year
We're gonna reach out to this new year




 Well there's no time like the present
To get you through your past
I'm nowhere near the future
But I'm gonna get there fast
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
Well I'm just passed Albuquerque
But somehow you're still near
I guess the objects in my mirror
Are closer than they appear
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
And I'll know it when I get there
But I don't think I'm getting close
There's a place without your memory
Somewhere down the road
I've cried a thousand miles of tears
I've got a thousand miles to go
They say life is like a highway
And sometimes the road gets rough
Girl you're like a twister
And I can't drive fast enough
But I'll keep on
Until you're gone
When I hit the water
And there's no place next to go
I'll take a left in this old vette
And head towards Mexico
And you'll be gone
But not for long




 Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Men are tied in chains of silence
I look on violence, up, down, left and right
Is there no hope of light
The peaceful hand that once caressed me
Hurts like the rest, because its turned to stone
Talons of steel have grown
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Yeah, oh help me, yeah
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos drowning in the stormy sea
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
See the moon, its getting nearer
But no more clearer than the earth below
What do we really know
I feel the stab of pain returning
Despair is burning in my heart again
Why dont they see the end, ooooh
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos drowning in the stormy sea
Yeah, throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me
Throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos drowning in the stormy sea
Yeah, throw down a line, help a poor boy
Whos hanging in a nowhere tree
Have you got a place for me




 Just another lonely trail
Heading through the pouring rain
I am lost in time and space
Remembering your face
Just another winding road
I don't know where it will go
All I know is that it
Takes me far from you
If I had my way
I'd be there beside you today
Until I'm home again
Till I see the morning in your eyes
Though the world may spin
Here inside my heart I'm only
Half alive
Till I'm home again
When I'm high above the clouds
Or alone inside the crowd
I'm a million miles from where I want to be
And oh day runs into night
And this room has run out of light
If I had my way
I'd be there beside you today
Until I'm home again
Till I see the morning in your eyes
Though the world may spin
Here inside my heart I'm only
Half alive
Till I'm home again
So tell me you will wait for me
You're the star in my horizon
Keep the fire warm for me
I'll be back before the first snow fall




 1. Sittin' in the sun like an ol' Tom Cat
That don't know just the way he's at
And I must admit to you, right now I feel that way too
Chorus
(Ain't got no way)
Ain't got no way to go
Nobody (wants) wants to know
And time drags by real slow
2. Sittin' on a log, watch the world go by
Fat told Frog, thinkin'




 (Wah-ah-ah-ah, du-du-du-du)
I haven’t dated anyone since we first met
I kissed you and I made you a vow I won’t forget
What else can I do, to prove my love for you
The week that you were out of town
I just stayed home
If I can’t be with you, I’d rather be alone
What else can I do, to prove my love for you
You were on my mind each day
I dream of you all night long
You were in my heart to stay
‘Cause my love is stronger than strong
I swear that I am yours and yours I’ll always be
Forever and forever you can count on me
What else can I do, to prove my love for you
What else can I do, to prove my love for you




 I picked up my baby just the other night
A we went a riding in the moonlight
I had real fine music on my radio
We're cool and pretty now don't you know
Oh there we were in a lovers lane
I said I'm out of gas baby and it' looks like rain
She said ooowee that's tough enough
My pretty baby she a looks so fine
I nearly drove my baby out of my mind
Settled easy kinda whispered low
She said Daddy Daddy I love you so
And I said ooowee that's tough enough
Now I searched everywhere all across the world
I'll never find no one that could top my girl
She thrills me from my head down to my toes
You see any sugar in my sugar bowl
And if it takes me for the rest of my life
Hey the people gonna make her my wife
I love my baby and it's plain to see
A when she rolls those big brown eyes at me
I go ooowee that's tough enough
My pretty baby she a looks so fine
I almost drove my baby out of my mind
Settled easy kinda whispered low
She said Daddy Daddy I love you so
And I said ooowee that's tough enough
And I said ooowee well that's tough enough




 Got no bags and baggage to slow me down
I'm travellin' so fast my feet ain't touchin' the ground
Travellin' light, travellin' light
I just can't wait to be with my baby tonight
No comb and no toothbrush, I've got nothing to haul
I'm carryin' only -
A pocketful of dreams, a heart full of love
And they weigh nothin' at all
Soon I'm gonna see that love look in her eyes
I'm a hoot and a holler away from paradise
Travellin' light, travellin' light
Well, I just can't wait to be with my baby tonight
Well, I just can't wait to be with my baby tonight
No comb and no toothbrush, I've got nothing to haul
I'm carryin' only -
A pocketful of dreams, a heart full of love
And they weigh nothin' at all
Soon I'm gonna see that love look in her eyes
I'm a hoot and a holler away from paradise
Travellin' light, travellin' light
Well, I just can't wait to be with my baby tonight
Mmmmmm...




 Just you know why
Why you and I
Will by and by
Know true love ways
Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why
Just you and I
Know true love ways
Throughout the days
Our true love ways
Will bring us joys to share
With those who really care
Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why
Just you and I
Know true love ways

 Ooh, well I got a girl with a record machine
When it comes to rockin' she's the queen
We love to dance on a Saturday night
All alone where I can hold her tight
But she lives on the twentieth floor uptown
The elevator's broken down
So I walked one, two flight, three flight, four
Five, six, seven flight, eight flight, more
Up on the twelfth I started to drag
Fifteenth floor I'm a-ready to sag
Get to the top, I'm too tired to rock
When she calls me up on the telephone
Say, come on over honey, I'm all alone
I said, baby you're mighty sweet
But I'm in bed with the achin' feet
This went on for a couple of days
But I couldn't stay away
Well they sent to Chicago for repairs
Till it's a-fixed I'm a-usin' the stairs
Hope they hurry up before it's too late
Want my baby too much to wait
All this climbin' is a-gettin' me down
They'll find my corpse draped over a rail
But I climbed one, two flight, three flight four

 The same heart-the same love
On the night you began
Meant everything-the closest thing
That your heart ever had
But dreams change-change your heart
And interfere with your plans
The same heart-the same love
Are now out of my hands
When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing
When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done
Well here you go-now you're free
Free to go where you please
But when you're free-all you hear
Is your lonely heart beat
When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing
When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done
When two hearts drift away
You can hear the voices say
Tha the real diamond ring
Didn't ever really mean a thing
When two hearts drift away
A lonely voice begins to say
There's no room for anyone
But you're thinking over what you've done
The same heart-the same love
On the night you began
Meant everything-the closest thing
That your heart ever had




 Like a dream, my life has gone past me
Taken so soon but love burns so true
Love never ending that shines like the stars in the sky
And I sing but so few can hear me
Words from the heart to set your souls free
Time has no distance deep in love
Know everything goes
Everyone knows there's something beyond us
There is a light believe me
Time turns into dust
Cry if you must
But love is the answer
Bringing two worlds together
Who can see the secrets that bind us?
Back to the earth 'til love rings so true
Eyes of compassion and tears of a deepening heart
I have seen the pain of a cruel world
And reached out a hand for suffering to ease
Bringing some comfort to the tears
Know everything goes
Everyone knows there's something beyond us
There is a light believe me
Time turns into dust
Cry if you must
But love is the answer
Bringing two worlds together Into one
A mountain of flowers And the perfume
Floating so high
Hush and the stillness in a million minds
Know everything goes
Everyone knows there's something beyond us
There is a light believe me
Time turns into dust
Cry if you must
But love is the answer
Bringing two worlds together Into one




 Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea
To the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Yeah
Lonely rivers sigh "Wait for me"
Wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me
Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered
Hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love, I
I need your love
God speed your love to me




 Looking at baby's face I saw the plight of the human race
Dying to survive
Shaken by the irony the anger rose inside of me
And would not, would not subside
I thought you're too young to understand
That the fate of every mortal man
Rests in someone's mortal hand tonight
In the nuclear insanity there's a death watch on the land and sea
And I believe that we may never live our lives
We were born under the gun and just like every mother's son
We are hostage to the megaton and the world could die tonight
Under the gun, we live in fear that the end will come
But there's one place to run
Run to the Son
Everyone can see that the hour is late
And every soul on Earth got to demonstrate
Their loving if we're to survive
'Cos we're tired of living on the brink
Scared to death that our ship will sink
At the winking of an eye
This course we're on's a big mistake
'Cos we all lose in the nuclear race
It's time to show all the heads of state that we believe
Yes we believe that we're fighting for our lives
We were born under the gun and just like every mother's son
We are hostage to the megaton and the world could die tonight
Under the gun, we live in fear that the end will come
But there's one place to run
Run to the Son
There's a finger on the button but if it's pressed we're not forgotten
Millions speak, feel no fear
The mood to change is in ascendance here
There's a finger on the button but if it's pressed we're not forgotten
Millions speak, feel no fear
The mood to change is in ascendance here
There's a finger on the button but if it's pressed we're not forgotten
There's a finger on the button but if it's pressed we're not forgotten




 You've come up in the world
And it's all to your credit
You made something of your life
Like you always said you would
But whatever happened to the girl I used to know
And all those halcyon days of love
You've come up in the world
And it's such a shame
You made a success of a dream
But it seems so empty now
With your weak excuses and
Your condescending ways
And all to frequent nights alone
I've come down in the world
And it's all to your credit
You made something of my life
But you've thrown it all away
For your books and your fancy talk
Your new-found friends and all
Your theories on mankind and society




 O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye to bethlehem
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Venite venite adoremus dominum
Venite venite adoremus dominum
Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exaltation
Oh sing all ye citizens
Glory to god in the highest
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Venite venite adoremus dominum
Venite venite adoremus dominum
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Oh come let us adore him
Venite venite adoremus dominum
Venite venite adoremus dominum
Oh come, oh come all ye faithful
Oh come, oh come all ye faithful
Oh come, oh come all ye faithful




 Visions of you in shades of blue
Smoking, shifting, lazily drifting
My darling, I miss you so
Time goes by, no wonder my
Senses go reeling, your eyes so appealing
I see the whole night through
When will we meet again? When? When? When?
When will we meet again? When? When? When?
I remember the days, beautiful days
Tenderly gleaming, my whole life seeming
To start and end with you
Visions of you in shades of blue
Smoking, shifting, lazily drifting
My darling, I miss you so
When will we meet again? When? When? When?
When will we meet again? When? When? When?
I remember the days, beautiful days
Tenderly gleaming, my whole life seeming
To start and end with you




 Wake up little Susie, wake up
Wake up little Susie, wake up
We both fell sound asleep
Wake up little Susie, wake up
Wake up little Susie, wake up
We both fell sound asleep
Wake up little Susie and weep
The movie's over, it's four O'clock
And we're in trouble deep
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say "Ooh la la"?
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
Well we told your mama that you'd be in by ten
Well Susie baby looks like we goofed again
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
We gotta go home
Wake up little Susie, wake up
Wake up little Susie, wake up
The movie wasn't so hot
It didn't have much of a plot
We fell asleep, our goose is cooked
Our reputation is shot
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say "Ooh la la"?
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie, wake up little Susie
Well, what are we gonna tell your mama?
What are we gonna tell your pa?
What are we gonna tell our friends
When they say "Ooh la la"?
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie
Wake up little Susie




 Hold on to what you believe
The only way to calm your sea, yeah!
Look back at the end of the day
Another step along the way
Some things, they never change
Don't have to fight to rearrange your life
It has mind of its own
So don't you worry, 'cause you're not alone
Walking in the light
No fear of the night
Walking in the light
No fear of the night, no
Walking so silently
See my troubles, I let them be
Living on Lonely Street
Where the life is bittersweet
It's not just another dream
Another play, another scene, yeah
Shifting sand beneath my feet
Ever moving, oh-so deep
Walking in the light
No fear of the night
Walking in the light
No fear of the night
Walking in the light
No fear of the night
Walking in the light
No fear of the night . .

 Used to think that life was sweet
Used to think we were so complete
I can't believe you'd throw it away
Used to feel we had it made
Used to feel we could sail away
Can you imagine how I feel today?
Well, it seems a long time ago
You were the lonely one
Now it comes to letting go
You are the only one
Do you know what you've done?
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (Sheep)
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho, we don't talk
Ooohooohooo
Well, it really doesn't matter to me
I guess your leaving was meant to be
It's down to you now, you wanna be free
Well, I hope you know which way to go
You're on your own again
And don't come crying to me
When you're the lonely one
Remember what you've done
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
It's so funny why we don't talk anymore
But I ain't losing sleep
And I ain't counting sheep (Sheep), no, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho, we don't talk
Ooohooohooohooo
We don't talk
But I ain't losing sleep, no
I ain't counting sheep (Sheep), no, no, no, no
It's so funny how we don't talk anymore
Ohoho
We don't talk
Ahaha, we don't talk

 We should be together for Christmas
Together with the ones we love
The ones we care for
We should be together for Christmas
And be there with the ones we love
And not be far away
That's why they invented planes
So we could fly away
To the ones we love
And be there for this day
We should be together for Cristmas
It isn't right to be apart
We could be here wild in our wishes
With all the love that's in my heart
I want you to be here
That's why they invented trains
So you could ride away
To the one you love
And be here for this day
We should be together
And it never matters where
Anyplace... We don't care
Long as we both are there
That's why they invented stars
I got no need for Cars
Just a wish and I could be there
Where you are




 My daddy had a 68 Camero
When I was sixteen he went out of town
There were car keys sitting on the bureau
Screaming out come take a drive around
From here to Linda's all the lights were yellow
Even though she said we were through
When she saw me in that red Camero
All she said was let's see what she'll do
What car, what girl, what tree, what curb
What are you talking about
I never left the house
What keys, what crash, how dare you ask
The car is gone - move on
(Daddy you'd better move on)
Monday morning he was in the kitchen
Asking if I had a tale to tell
A certain red collectible was missing
Sorry daddy that doesn't ring a bell
I was running late but I agreed to join him
At the scene of the alleged theft
But there's an emptiness you can't ignore
Where the stain of oil is all that you have left
Even if they found the wreckage
Even if they haul me in
I'm sticking to the same old story
Again and again and again and again

Spend the lifetime of love
Make her yours for evermore
Make her yours for evermore




 We turned water into wine but that didn't last
We were the victims of our age
Now we live on different floors
And go our separate ways
And talk behind closed doors
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart
We used to sit around the fire
And whisper words the world outside would make no claim to hear
But now we talk an octave higher
In droning tones that don't relate at all to yester year
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart
Do you remember when we were seventeen
We took a boat out for an hour
But we preferred the greenery to the scenery of the sea
And tied up in some cosy cove
Till harbour lights appeared across the bay
Into love and out of mind
A poet claimed that loving you has only made me blind
But love is really crystal clear
It's only when you need someone the clouds will soon appear
We changed our world waiting for it all to end
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart
Do you remember when laughter was the cure
For all the hard times that we knew
But we forgot to feed the fire - let it all burn down
Warmth returns to cold and poison into pain
It's such a shame but who's to blame
When two worlds drift apart




 From the cradle of England
To a foreign exchange
Thorough the clamour of long years away
I never lost sight of
The reason that I left you:
To return to you one day
From the bleak and familiar
To the tropical strange
Through the glamour of empires abroad
I never abandoned
The hope of reclaiming
My legitimate reward
When you thought of me
If you had the time
You never would have known
The mountains I'd climb
I won't be without again, woman
You won't drive me out again, woman
And as you come to learn
All that *I've done was for you
You'll see what obsession can do
Woman
So the unschooled outcast
The irascible youth
Has become all the things you desired
I took all they offered
And learned their deceptions
All relentlessly acquired
And the eyes of the traveller
See an obvious truth
You've become all the things you've denied
And the loss of ambition
Was colouring your reason
As the pleasure in you died
When you thought of me
Had me on your mind
You never would have dreamed
Of the riches I'd find
I won't be without again, woman
You won't drive me out again, woman
And as you come to learn
All that I've done was for you
You'll see what obsession can do
Woman




 Standing above me
Is someone who wants to love me
Oh oh where do we go from here
Holding my life in your hands
I want to do what you command oh
Oh oh where do we go from here
I'd never thought I'd want you
As much as I do now
I never thought I'd need you
As much as I do now
But I do now
My life was ending
But with you it's just beginning
Oh oh where do we go from here
Oh oh everything seems so clear
Oh oh now that we've come this far
Where do we go from here
I've made my decision
There will be no more division
Oh oh where do we go from here
Oh oh everything seems so clear
Oh oh now that we've come this far
Where do we go from here
I've made my decision
There will be no more division
Oh oh where do we go from here




 You say, lean on me
I lean on you and find
That you have got the strenght
To get me through my day
You say, trust in me
I trusted you and so I found
The truth that set me free
And on my way
All that I am
And everything I'll ever be
Is because of you, because you're in my heart
And I'm dazzled by all that I see
By everything surrounding me
So come back, take me to where you are
Nothing I say, nothing I do
Could ever repay my debt I owe to you
You give and I receive
Here I stand, my head in a whirl
A little bit lost
A little in awe of what you say
You have in store for me
All that I am and everything I'll ever be
Is because of you, because you're in my heart
And I'm dazzled by all that I see
By everything surrounding me
So come back, take me to where you are
All that I am and everything I'll ever be
Is because of you, because you're in my heart
And I'm dazzled by all that I see
By everything surrounding me
So come back, take me to where you are




 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas's be white

 You wonder why do the things you do
With all the heartache that you've been through
It's only human to feel like this
It's only human the need to kiss
Too many times you've begun to cry
And after all this time you still don't know why
It's only human to feel so much
It's only human the need to touch
Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
So madly, who's in love
You wonder what will the future be
And will the answer be there for you to see
You're only human, you need to love
It's only human the need to love
Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
So madly, who's in love
Listen to your heartbeat (*4)
Listen to your heartbeat (*4)
Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
Who's in love, in love with someone new
Who's in love, in love with someone madly
So madly, who's in love
You're only human
You need to kiss




 I wonder if after all this time
You think of me
Do you ever miss my company?
You never could doubt about
The way that I feel
Tell me: D'you feel it too?
It's funny how after all this time
You're all I see
I wonder if you still keep your key
And now that you're gone
There's nothing left for me here
Just a wide open space
And I can't forget that smile on your face
There's a wide open space
And noone else can stand in your place
There's a wide open space here in my heart
It's funny how all at once
The world can turn around
Taking you up to bring you down
And suddenly life has passed me by
And I'm left with a wide open space
You know I can't forget that smile...
... Wide open space here in my heart
I couldn't believe it when I thought
I heard you say
You'd never be coming back this way
And since you've been gone
There's been no love for my heart
No, not a trace
And I can't forget that smile...
... Wide open space here in my heart




 Look at the golden dawn
See the sunset
On the silver thorn
Just remember
It was all for you and me
High on the ragged hill
He was dying
And he's dying still
Oh my Lord
You were born to set men free
And the mission bells are ringing
As the prisoner finds release
And the love we knew is returning
Like wild geese
And the signal fires are burning
For the everlasting peace
And the love we knew is returning
Like wild geese
Only the closest heart
Could believe that love's
A dying art
After all the
Hungry mouths he fed
Eyes on the gentle one
Looked for the kindness
But they gave him none
Not a sip of wine
Or a crust of bread




 Way back when in fifty eight
We had a move that move was great
We could walk and stroll and susie q

Willie had a girl called jivin jilly
Inhibitions she didn't have any

They opened up that pearly gate
We could rock we could roll
Everyone could do the stroll
Dancin just to stay alive
We all did the crazy hand jive




 I'm just a little tin soldier in your hands
I'm good for nothing but to obey your commands
You've never really loved me I know
So wind me up, let me go
I'm just a play thing till you see someone else
And then you leave me alone on the shelf
But even tin soldiers have hearts, don't you know?
So wind me up, let me go
You don't really need me, you've a hundred other toys
And tear drops don't look good in the eyes of soldier boys
So pick me up and hold me one more time
That's just consolation for this heart of mine
Whisper a sweet word to the one who loves you so
Then wind me up, let me go
Then wind me up, let me go
Let me go




 I like small speakers
I like tall speakers
If they've music they're wired for sound
Walking about with a head full of music
Cassette in my pocket and I'm gonna use it
Stereo
Out on the street, you know
Ohohohohohohoho, oho
Into the car, go to work and I'm cruising
I never think that I'll blow all my fuses
Traffic flows
Into the breakfast show
Ohohohohohohoho, oho
Oh, oh, oh
Power from the needle to the plastic
AM, FM, I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
And I'm wired for sound
I was small boy who don't like his toys
I could not wait to get wired for sound
I met a girl and she told me she loved me
I said: "You love me, then love means
You must like what I like
My music is dynamite"
Ohohohohohohoho, oho
She said: "I'm not a girl you can put on at a standby
I am a girl who demands that her love is amplified
Switching to overdrive"
Ohohohohohohoho, oho
Oh, oh, oh
Power from the needle to the plastic
AM, FM, I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
And I'm wired for sound
Power from the needle to the plastic
AM, FM, I feel so ecstatic now
It's music I've found
'Cause I'm wired for sound
I like small speakers (I like small speakers)
I like tall speakers (I like tall speakers)
If there's music, they're wired for sound
I like small speakers (I like small speakers)
I like tall speakers (I like tall speakers)
If there's music, they're wired for sound
I like small speakers (I like small speakers)
I like tall speakers (I like tall speakers)
If there's music, they're wired for sound
I like small speakers
I like tall speakers




 Gaye
Won't you let me have a say
In the way you behave
I won't last another day
If you decide to go away
CHORUS:
You're the tray of nice things
I upset yesterday
The display of bright rings
I let slip away
****
Oh Gaye
You allay my every fear
In a most extraordinary way
If I thought that I could find
My way without you
I would not ask you to stay
CHORUS:
You're the tray of nice things
I upset yesterday
The mainstay of my dreams
That I let slip away
****
Gaye
Won't you let me have a say
In the way you behave
I won't last another day
If you decide to go away
Don't go away
Oh please stay
Don't go away
Please stay

 Drawer back the curtain
Let the sun stream in
So tell me a story
When you're ready, begin
Speak of the peaceful
The gracious, the wise
Let the world hear our laughter
Before it dies
With a beginning
There must be an end
What is the truth of that my friend
From the sound of the joyous
The gentle, the mild
Please look out at life
With the eyes of a child
From the eyes of a child
Keep out darkness and let in light
Let the eyes of a child
See little things that will give him peace
And fill his life
Short is the memory
But long is the hate
For peace on the earth
How long must we wait?
Think of the colours
The seasons, the sun
Put an end to the sorrows
That we have begun
From the eyes of a child
Keep out darkness and let in light
Let the eyes of a child
See little things that will give him peace
And fill his life
Drawer back the curtain
The stage is all set
And start on a story
We'll never forget
Tell all the hopeful
The loving, the mild
Then look out at life
With the eyes of a child

Do all the things that you do in your dreams
And you'll see it's a wonderful life
A wonderful life

 Way down in the land of sunny Mexico
There's a fellow, I'm sue that you all know
Any time within his trouble there
You bound to hear his cry ringing through the air
Andele y'arriva
Andele y'arriva
In Spanish this means I'm here
Andele, andele, andele y'arriva
One day last May a tourist came to town
And very soon he started hanging 'round
With the Speedy's girl giving her the eye
And suddenly he heard this famous cry
Andele y'arriva
Andele y'arriva
In Spanish this means I'm here
Andele, andele, andele y'arriva
He hit the tourist with the speed of light
And next to no-time he had won the fight
The last words he remembered for his flight
Were: Senor, you're leaving Mexico tonight
Andele y'arriva
Andele y'arriva
In Spanish this means I'm here
Andele, andele, andele y'arriva
So if you ever go to sunny Mexico
Enjoy yourself but be careful how you go
And listen well to everything I say
'Cause I was that tourist there one day last May
Andele y'arriva
Andele y'arriva
In Spanish this means I'm here
Andele, andele, andele y'arriva




 One thing leads to another
Take his message, feel it in your heart

We've lived to lie too long!

Burn your past, give him your tomorrow

 When did you becomethe topic of conversation
When did you become this country's
Popular myth
Seems that overnight you caught
Everybody's attention
Everybody sings about you and your name
Bounces off their lips
When did you become superstar of
This generation
And when did you become commercial property
Everybody's got their own sweet lord
Hear them sing
Looking here, looking there but they just don't
Seem sweet
Were you a guru, a godly man
Or where you a genius, the best in the land
I read in the paper that you were back in fashion
Amongst the famous men you were high on the list
Don't they realise that fashion's a passing fancy
The truth is yesterday, today, forever
You'll be staying
Yesterday, today, forever never wavering
You stated who you were and that will
Never change
Like it or not you'll always be the same
Son of God
Like it or not, yesterday, today, forever (x6)
Yesterday, today, forever, like it or not




 You belong to my heart, now and forever
And our love had it's start, not long ago
We were gathering stars while a million guitars played our love song
When I said, "I love you", every beat of my heart said it, too
Was a moment like this, do you remember?
And your eyes threw a kiss when they met mine
Now we own all the stars and a million guitars are still playing
Darling, you are the song and you'll always belong to my heart
You belong to my heart, now and forever
And our love had it's start, not long ago
We were gathering stars while a million guitars played our love song
When I said, "I love you", every beat of my heart said it, too




 Gave us life for the living
And love for the giving
So thanks for the making
It's nice partaking
Now you got me wondering how it all began
My imagination fails to perceive
A million different questions fail to get an answer
I think that's why I'll always believe
As we go through this life
We'll ask you once or twice
Was all this your making
Sleep, dreaming, waking
Sweet is the sound of your voice
Singing your song
Leaving my questions undone
Oh you get me wondering
Now you got me wondering how it all began
My imagination fails to perceive
A million different questions fail to get an answer
I think that's why I'll always believe
Now you got me wondering how it all began
My imagination fails to perceive
A million different questions fail to get an answer
I think that's why I'll always believe




 Wild woman put a spell over me
Gave me your love and now i've lost my-sanity
Can't think straight now,i've lost my mind-my mind
Believe me now honey,you're just one of a kind
Chorus:
You know that i love you, you know so well
You know that i love you, oh can't you tell
I want to be with you, come rain come shine
Oh won't you tell me honey you'll be mine
You can't change the lord done made you that way
I am laying no blame,that's how i want you to stay
Ain't my luck to find a woman so fine-so fine
Luck has changed thrown a seven this time
You know that i love you,you know so well
You know that i love you,oh can't you tell
Chorus repeated




 If I said I loved you
What would you say?
If I said I needed you
Would it frighten you away?
If I said I loved you
And I wanted you to be
My one and only lover
Eternally
Chorus
You and me and Jesus
Jesus, me and you;
On our own we'd break
With Him we'll make it through
Jesus, take us, make us
What you want us both to be;
I give myself to her
She gives herself to me
Love is really fragile
And if it's going to last
We've got to start by giving Jesus
Future, present, past
I ache the way I love you
But, babe, it's sink or swim
And when we look back years from now
We're gonna owe it all to Him
Chorus
You and me and Jesus
Jesus, me and you;
On our own we'd break
With Him we'll make it through
Jesus, take us, make us
What you want us both to be;
I give myself to her
She gives herself to me




 I've been here before
On the street of hearts
Tryin' to find my way
To be close to you
Takin' careful steps
Makin' some mistakes
Now it's judgement day
But all along I knew
Could this one be magic
Tell me what the rumours say
Now the whispers started
There's no turning back
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
When I see the love that's shining in your eyes
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
And I'm thankful there's a place in heavens sky
I can hear you breathing
Loving heart and healing hands
On a solo flight
Sent from heavens door
Hear you call my name
When love came first
To be where you are
Like a shooting star
Tryin' to chase the flame
From heaven down to earth
Runnin' in slow motion
Tryin' to find a place to hide
I guess there's no escapin'
Time to face the facts
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
When I see the love that's shining in your eyes
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
Now I'm flyin' so high
I've heard that heaven must be missing an angel
Don't care what the story's worth
All I care is that you're here beside me
My angel - here on earth
Solo
I can hear you breathing
Loving heart and healing hands
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
When I see the love that's shining in your eyes
You move heaven for me
You bring heaven down to earth
And I'm thankful there's aplace in heavens sky
Repeat 'til fade




 There are times - when you know
Love is lost to he who hesitates and you've got that
Feeling now you know it too well
Say O. K. - to your dreams
Never let that chance go by again
If it's love you need then listen and listen well
You've got to run like a young love
You've got to love like young love
Believe me you'll be a young love
You don't need to be anymore
You can think like a young love
Be strong like a young love
You can run like a young love
You don't need to be anymore
Live it now - everyday
Cause you know there is no better way
And in time you'll understand it's all in your heart
Lightning strikes - in the rain
But you know inside you're strong again
You can hear the thunder roll
But you stand apart
You've got to run like a young love
You can love like young love
Believe me you'll be a young love
You don't need to be anymore
As long as you think like a young love
Be strong like a young love
You can run like a young love
You don't need to be anymore




 Your eyes tell on you
Your eyes tell on you
Just lately, it seems
You're acting strange to me
But now it's so plain, so very plain to see
I thought and I thought
What was it I'd done wrong
And then at once I knew
Your love for me was gone
When you look at him, your eyes tell on you
Well now you never, you never, looked at me
With such a loving, longing plea
I guess I've had my day now
What more is there to say now?
Your eyes are the eyes
That told me I loved you
And now they look at him
With all the love I knew
I gave you my heart
And everything I had
Now they look at him, Making me feel so bad
When you look at him, your eyes tell on you
Well now you never, you never, looked at me
With such a loving, longing plea
I guess I've had my day now
What more is there to say now?
Your eyes tell on you (3x to end.)




 When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, whoa nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running, oh yeah baby
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah
You've got a friend
If the sky above you
Should turn dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind should begin to blow
Keep your head together and call my name out loud
And soon I will be knocking upon your door
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you got to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend?
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
Well they'll take your soul if you let them
Oh yeah, but don't you let them
You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Oh babe, don't you know that
Winter spring summer or fall
Hey now, all you've got to do is call
Lord, I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend?
You've got a friend




 You've got to give me all your lovin'
'Cause a man ain't nothin' without woman's love
You've got to give me all your lovin'
Give it all to me 'cause a part just ain't enough
Like a flower needs the rain to grow
Like a winter needs a fall of snow
You're the one I need
To satisfy my soul
It's a lonely feelin' late at night
Without you here to put the feelin' right
You're the one I need
Your love is out of sight
You've got to give me all your lovin'
'Cause a man ain't nothin' without woman's love
You've got to give me all your lovin'
Give it all to me 'cause a part just ain't enough
You're the only woman on my mind
I've been waitin' such a long long time
If you stay by me who knows what you might find
There's a certain magic in your smile
And it's plain to see you've sure got style
Just to be with you I'd walk a thousand miles
You've got to give me all your lovin'
'Cause a man ain't nothin' without woman's love
You've got to give me all your lovin'
Give it all to me 'cause a part just ain't enough
