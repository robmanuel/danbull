Living as an angel in the
Place that I was born
Living on air
Living in heaven
Giving the lie down, the line
To the
There's my heaven
And I know
Which way the wind blows
In nineteen fifty-nine
Which way the wind blows
In nineteen fifty-nine
And the wind blows still
And the wind blows wild again
For a little child can never kill this clean
This way
And it feels like me today
Tell me
Do you feel the same?
Isabelle?
Or do you feel like nineteen fifty-nine?
...Do you feel like nineteen fifty-nine?
And the wind blows wild again
And the wind blows wild
In nineteen fifty-nine
In fifty-nine
Isabelle
Do you, do you feel the same?
Come with me
Like a little child
Like another gun
Like homeless, restless, known to none, like
Way beyond the line
Like it never was
In nineteen fifty-nine




 Well all right!!!
Well it's 1969 ok
We got a war across the USA
There's nothing here for me and you
We're just sitting here with nothing to do
Well there's nothing here for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Now last year I was 21
I didn't have a lot of fun
Now I'm gonna be 22
So, oh my, I'll boohoo
Now I'm gonna be 22
So, oh my, I'll boohoo
Well it's 1969 ok
We got a war across the USA
There's nothing here for me and you
We're just sitting here with nothing to do
Well it's 1969, baby
Well it's 1969, baby
Well it's 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9-teen 69
Teen 69 (3x)
Yow!!! (3x)




 We'll turn away in a passive decision
We'll take the steps through the unmarked door
A look back for another collision
But the boys of the spires
Are boys no more
Not black and red boys
Frightened by the night
By the catholic monochrome
The catholic girls now
Stark in their dark and white
Dread in monochrome
The sisters of mercy
High tide
Wide eyed
Sped on adrenochrome
For the sisters of mercy
Filled with
Panic in their eyes
Rise
Dead on adrenochrome
We had the power
We had the space
We had a sense of time and place
We knew the words
We knew the score
We knew what we were fighting for
For the freedom
The time to choose
But time to think
Is time to lose
The signals clash
And disappear
The shade too loud
And the sound unclear
For the
High tide
Wide eyed
Dread in monochrome
Denied in spite
Disliked in monochrome
Panic in their eyes
Rise
Dead and monochrome
The sisters of mercy
Spite
On adrenochrome
The way is clear
The road is closed
The damage done
And the course
Imposed you




 One more night spent on your mirror
Black maria, in your eyes
This stuff so strange and lonely
England fades away
In your eyes
Two o'clock in the morning
Ninety-four degrees
Through the stillness through the heat
The cars go by on Fifth and
Breathing slow
Get up off the floor and angel
Put your clothes on
It's time for us to go
Let's take a ride




 Alice pressed against the wall
So she can see the door
In case the laughing strangers crawl and
Crush the petals on the floor
Alice in her party dress
She thanks you kindly
So serene
She needs you like she needs her tranqs
To tell her that the world is clean
To promise her a definition
Tell her where the rain will fall
Tell her where the sun shines bright
And tell her she can have it all
Today
Today
Pass the crystal spread the Tarot
In illusion comfort lies
The safest way the straight and narrow
No confusion no surprise
Alice in her party dressed to kill
She the thanks you turns away
Needs you like she needs her pills
To tell her that the world's okay
To promise her a definition
Tell her where the rain will fall
Tell her where the sun shines bright
And tell her she can have it all
Today
Today
Alice
Don't give it away
Nooo




 Watch them do
The falling over
Watch them do
The standing still
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more S....
(Women)
And the women come and go
(Talk)
Talking about me like they know
(Men)
Bought and sold
And the world keeps turning
People cold
And people burning
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more S....
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more S.... (Amphetamine Logic)
Hit up
Steel in hand
Lit up
Like candles
Burning
Like Catherine wheels
Turning
On
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more S.... (Amphetmine Logic)




 Baby buy an Anaconda baby buy a thing to wear
She go walking she go crawling she go sliding through the air
She go talking warm and fashion she go talking debonair
But see her face turn to a mask and passion turn to she don't care
She will she will she will she will let it take her breath away
She will she will she will she will let it take her life away
Let it wrap itself around her till it kill her in it's way
She will she will she will she will blow away
Baby hit the rush hour traffic get a ride to anywhere
Baby buy the number three she pay the man she pay the fare
Baby hit the wild blue yonder on the mainline on the side
Steal to feed the Anaconda will not see the suicide
She will she will she will she will let it take her breath away
She will she will she will she will let it take her life away
Let it wrap itself around her till it kill her in it's way
She will she will she will she will blow away
Baby finger on the trigger baby shot formaldehyde
Turn into a marble figure turn the matter dead inside
Turn into a China doll maybe go to the final ride
Baby go where I don't follow baby to the other side
She will she will she will she will let it take her breath away
She will she will she will she will let it take her life away
Let it wrap itself around her till it kill her in it's way
She will she will she will she will blow away




 And she came to look for me
Sold me name and innocence
Took my key
And told me to follow her
Down from igor with her bangles and her reference
One from the church from the valley of the
Well she wanted a haven and a place to hide
So I gave her an alibi took her inside but
A rock and a hard place await for for me
Between the devil and the deep blue sea
Everything I ever did right or wrong
Hid out of sight where I belong, belong
And I didn't have the heart to tell her
Why
And there wasn't a part of me that
Didn't want to say goodbye but
Cause and effect go hand in hand with
The devil may care but I don't mind and I
Thought she'd never quite understand so I
Left her there that night but will she
Find me? I don't think so, no
When you go, you go alone
And I'm gone.............
Far away (x4)
And I didn't have the heart to tell
Why
And there wasn't a part of me that
Didn't want to say goodbye but...

 Through the cables and the underground now
The faceless breathless calls
This is babel, sensurround now
This place is death with walls
Too much contact, no more feeling
The sound around them all
Acid on the floor so she walk on the ceiling
And the body electric flashes on the bathroom wall
And the body electric flashes on the bathroom wall
Crawling to the corners where the idiot children call
See the body flashing on the bathroom wall

The kissing and the colour come crashing down

 Call it superstition (Lie beside and)
Followed and fell (Bury me)
Under the falling (Deep)
Under the spell
Singing
Bury me
Bury me
Spoken in tongues
Of many colours
In the colours of heaven
In the colours of hell
In the cannot
Would not tell
In the broken temple bells
In the ringing
Oh, Marian
I can hear those voices singing
Bury me
Deep

Lie beside and
Bury Me

In the spoken in tongues
Cover me over
Unsung
Unsaid
Not borrowed, broken and torn
On the bed tomorrow, mourning
Before you sleep
Bury me deep

Lie beside and
Bury me bury me bury me bury me deep
Call it superstition
Followed and fell
Under the falling
Under the spell
Bury me

 We slip on the vinyl
We shimmer to shine
Slide on the chrome and plastic
The hum of the powerlines
Sum of a love
Come trip the light fantastic
Singing:
Do I drive?
Or am I driven?
Can I brake
What I've been given?
Take a walk
Turn
Talk
Or crash and burn
Everybody get a wife, I got mine
She's kneeling on the backseat, feeling fine, she's
Married to a soldier in the army of the Rhine, but
He don't know so he don't mind, she says
Do I drive?
Or am I driven?
Can I brake
What I've been given?
Take a walk
Turn
Talk
Or crash and burn
Slip on the vinyl
Shimmer to shine
Sing:
Do I drive?
Or am I driven?
Can I brake
What I've been given?
Take a walk
Turn
Talk
Or crash and burn




 Roll of the thunder
Kiss and the scream
Hold out my arms and scars start to show
Howling for the glory of the innocent
But don't despair for the shame I know
The taste of ash on my tongue
Faith and prayers, wanton dust
Chanting strangers, blood on their cheeks
Haunt my dreams all covered in blood
Dance
Dance on glass
Saints and martyrs
Dance
Dance on glass
Saints and martyrs
Tarnish, taint and punish me softly
Cut that bleeds and burning skin
Screaming in the darkness torn and ragged
For the love of god, my dreams look dim
So...
Dance
Dance on glass
Saints and martyrs
A whisper and a promise lit on fire
Kiss the hand where the angels dread
Love is the corpse that draws on dreams
Rips them apart and tears them to shreds
So...
Dance
Dance on glass
Saints and martyrs
Tarnish, taint, and punish me softly
Hold out the heat and burning skin
Screaming in the darkness torn and ragged
For the love of god, my dreams look dim
A whisper and a promise lit on fire
Kiss the hands where the angels dread
Love is the corpse that draws on dreams
Rips them apart and tears them to shreds
So...
Dance
Dance on glass
Saints and martyrs
Dance
Dance on glass




 On Detonation Boulevard...
Through the angel rain
Through the dust and the gasoline
Through the cruelty of strangers
To the neon dream
Long distance information
Just tell me where the manholes steam
A little girl waits on my station
With a new machine
On Detonation Boulevard...
I got wrecked out here
In a Eldorado
I got wired, white-walled
This hot-wired sedan
I caught something weird in Encenada
I've a brother of sorts in Torquemada
Long distance information
Disconnect me if you can
On Detonation Boulevard...
Pink noise, white noise
And a violet whining sound
It burns inside this car
No cops, no signs, no left, no right
No stops, no turning round
Well you can run but you can't ride
You won't get far
On Detonation Boulevard..
Bang Bang
On Detonation Boulevard...
Through the angle rain
Through the rust and the gasolene
Through the cruelty of strangers
To the neon dream
Long distance information
I'll take the same
I got the fuel for the transformation
I'm a naked flame
On Detonation Boulevard...
Bang Bang




 Everybody shouts on I Love Lucy
Pee Wee reads the evening news
A pre-owned song or a second-hand Uzi
Everybody got a job to lose
Here come the golden oldies
Here come the Hizbollah
Businessmen from South Miami
Humming AOR
Meanwhile...
I like Cal and his dog Napalm
I like Ike and his itty-bitty A-bomb
Everybody got one, I want mine
You can order it up on Channel Nine
Meanwhile, in the Sheraton
Doctor Jeep plays on and on and on
There was a time but it's long gone
Janie got a crush on the Viet Cong
Burning through downtown Saigon
Me, I'm sold - down the Mekong
Meanwhile, in the Sheraton
Doctor Jeep plays on and on and on
Guns and cars and accidents
The threatened witness my defence
You can sell one another for fifteen cents
Well bye-bye mother, it's common sense

 In the heat of the night
In the heat of the day
When I close my eyes
When I look your way
When I meet the fear that lies inside
When I hear you say
In the heat of the moment
Say, say, say
Some day, some day, some day, Dominion
Come a time
Some day, some day, some day, Dominion
Some say prayers
Some say prayers
I say mine
In the light of the fact
On the lone and level
Sand stretch far away
In the heat of the action
In the settled dust
Hold hold and say
In the meeting of mined
Down in the streets of shame
In the betting of names on gold to rust
In the land of the blind
Be...King, king, king, king
Some day, some day, some day, Dominion
Come a time
Some day, some day, some day, Dominion
Some say prayers

We serve an old man in a dry season
A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There's a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I'm living in films for the sake of Russia
A Kino Runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daughters of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift...nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:
Mother Russia
Mother Russia
Mother Russia rain down down down
Mother Russia
Mother Russia
Mother Russia rain down

 Still night, nothing for miles
White curtain come down
Kill the lights in the middle of the road
And take a look, take a look around.....
It don't help to be one of the chosen
One of the few, to be sure
When the wheels are spinning around
And the ground is frozen through, and you're
Driven, like the snow
Pure in heart
Driven together
And given
Away to the west
A white dress
'til the river don't run
A black dress
Looking like mine
'til the sun don't shine no more
Where the sky meet the ground
Where the street fold round
Where the voice you hold don't
Make no sound, look
Snow on the river and two by two
Took a lot to live a lot like you, I don't
Go there now, but I hear they sung
Their "Fuck me and marry me young"
Some wild idea and a big white bed, now
You know better than that, I said
Like a voice in the wind blow little crystal down
Like brittle things will break before they turn
Like lipstick on my cigarette
And the ice get harder overhead
Like think it twice but never never learn...
And the mist will wrap around us
And the crystal, if you touch it...
And the cars
Lost in the drift
Are there
And the people that drive
Lost in the drift
Are there
And the cares I've
Lost in the drift
Are there
Theirs, ours
Lost in the drift
Are
Are
Are
Are
Are..
Driven
Driven together
And driven
Apart




 Lay me down the long white line
Leave the sirens far behind me
Home to weakness
Home to silence
Follow me when the sun goes down
We will find a heartless highway
We will wind the windows down
... me at the mounted towers
Then the marvels, ... friends abound ...
While the wheels go wheeling round and round
Life is short and life is cruel
But we have beer and we have fuel
We are never coming down
Push the creature on it's back
Lines across the middle ...
Houses vacant everafter
Gusting through the cold and shadow
While the ... flashes past
Around we ... the big black car
... touch the sky
... sell your bracelets
We are never coming down
We will be forever wild
The wheels go wheelings round and round
And the wheel ...s come in silence
Follow me when the sun goes down
We will fly along the highway
We will wind the windows down
... me at the mounted towers
When the ... turns around
Reason ... power
While the wheels go wheeling round and round




 We were together since we were five
She was so pretty
Emma was a star in everyone's eyes
And when she said she'd be a movie queen
Nobody laughed
Her face like an angel
She could be anything
Emmaline
Emma
Emmaline
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen
Emmaline
Emma
Emmaline
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen
At seventeen
We were wed
And I worked day and night to earn our daily bread
And every day
Emma would go out searching for that play
That never, ever came her way
And sometimes she come home and she'd be so depressed
I'd hear her crying in the back room and be so distressed
And I'd remember back way when she was five
To the words that used to make Emmaline come alive
It was...
Emma Emmaline
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen
Emmaline
Emma Emmaline
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen
It was a cold and dark December night
When I opened up the bedroom door
To find her lying
Still and cold upon the bed
A love letter lying on the bedroom floor
It read
'Darling I love you
But I just can't keep on living on this dreams no more
I've tried so very hard not to leave you alone
But I just can't keep on trying no more'
Ahh Emma
Emmaline
Ahh Emma
Emmaline
Ahh Emma
Noooooo
Ahh Emma
Noooooooooooo




 See a body and the dream of the dead days
Following lost and blind
Living, far from here
Tomorrow is hard to find
And it seems like twenty-five years of
Promises and give me more
Scenes of a hand me down in
Dresses heard before
First and last and always: 'til the end of time
First and last and always: Mine
Maybe it's not so easy
Maybe it's a way too long
Say, say you'll be by me
When the evidence comes along
First and last and always: My calling, my time
First and last and always: Mine
(My calling)
(My time)
See a body and the dream of the dead days
A following lost and blind
Cross my heart with silver
Here's the key behind
Seems like twenty-five years of
Ever after, ever more more more
Seems I wore this face for you
Far too long before
First and last and always: My calling, my time
First and last and always: Mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of the end of time
First and last and always: Mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of time
First and last and always: Mine




 Love for the party love for the nation
Love for the fix for the fabrication
Love for the corpse for the corporation
Love for the death and for the defecation
Romance and assassination
Give me the love of genocide
Give me love




 And her hallway
Moves
Like the ocean
Moves
At the head of the river
At the source of the sea
Sitting here now in this bar for hours
Trying to write it down
Fitting in hard with harder to come
Trying to fight it
Down the river there's a ship will carry you
Down river down stream
Down the river there's a ship will carry the
Dream
Dream of the flood
Down the river there's a ship will carry the
Dream of the flood
And her hallway...
As the water come rushing over
As the water come rushing in
As the water come rushing over
Flood...Flood...
Push the glass, stain the glass
Push the writer to the wall
It may come but it will pass
Some say we will fall
Dream of the flood...
Flood...
And her hallway...
Oh, maybe, in terms of surrender
On a backcloth of lashes and eyes
In a flood of your tears, in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes and ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes and lies...
And her hallway...
Like...
As the water come rushing in
As the water come rushing over
Sitting here now in this bar for hours
While these strange men rent strange flowers
I'll be picking up your petals in another few hours
In the metal and blood, in the scent and mascara
On a backcloth of lashes and stars
In a flood of your tears, in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes and secondhand passion
And stolen guitars
And her hallway...
As the water come rushing in
(Like the sea)
As the water come rushing over
(Dream of the flood)
In a flood of your tears, in sackcloth
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes
And ashes and ashes and lies...
As the water come rushing in, rushing in
At the head of the river
At the source of the sea
And her hallway...
Like...
Flood...




 And her hallway moves
Like the ocean moves
And her hallway moves
Like the sea
Like the sea
She says no no no no harm will come your way
She says bring it on down, bring on the wave
She says: nobody done no harm
Grace of God and raise your arms
She says: face it and it's a place to stay
This, this is the way it was
This, this is the way it is
When the water come rushing, rushing in
She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood
And her hallway
Like...
Like...
Like a million voices call my name
Like a million voices calling
Not now, not never again...
Sitting here now in this bar for hours
Strange men rent strange flowers
Seconds to the drop but it feels like hours and I
Think I'm going to... going to sleep
This, this is the way it was
This, this is the way it is
When the water come rushing, rushing in
She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood
And her hallway...
She says
She says anytime
Raise your arms
Flood
And her hallway...




 The bodies on the naked on the low damp ground
In the violet hour to the violent sound
And the darkness the blinding the eyes that shine
And the voices singing line on line
This is the floorshow the clapping hands
Animal flow from the animal glands
In the violet hour to the violent sound
Going round and around and around and around and around
I feel the bite I feel the beat I see the dancing feet
I feel the light I feel the heat I see the new elite
I see the final floorshow I see the western dream
I see the faces glow and I see the bodies steam
See them shimmy see them go
See their painted faces glow
Slow slow quick quick slow
See those pagans go go go go go
Why, this is the floorshow the last ideal
It's populist got mass appeal
The old religion redefined
For the facile futile totally blind
For the totally blind
Mundane by day inane at night
Pagan playing in the flashing light
In the violet hour to the violent sound
Going round and around and around and around and around
The bodies and the naked on the low damp ground
In the violet hour to the violet sound
And the darkness the blinding the eyes that shine
And the voices singing line on line
See them shimmy see them go
See their painted faces glow
Slow slow quick quick slow
See those pagans go go go go go




 Shimmering over all those wistful faces
And the promise burning brightly in their eyes
In this violent flesh the cut that bleeds the kiss that stings
Desperate snows fall from desperate skies
Take my hand and lead me
To the garden of delight
Take my hand and lead me
Home.....
Reflections in the liquid windswept mirror
The breathless world elegance and charm
The treasured touch, the first touch of a stranger
It charmed me, entranced me, no harm
So...
Take my hand and lead me
To the garden of delight
Take my hand and lead me
Home.....
This child of death, kissing in the playground
Senses swirling, faithful to the kill
Playing with fire,a chance among the playsound
Covered in burns and turn away, they're dancing still
So...
Take my hand and lead me
To the garden of delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the garden
Of delight
Of delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the garden of delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the garden
Of delight
Of delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the garden of delight
Take my hand and lead me
Home.....
Home (home)

 Half past twelve
And I'm watching the lateshow
In my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds blow
Outside the window
As I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow
Get that fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window
And I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day




 Oh, see the storm is threatening
My very life today
If I don't get some shelter
Yeah, I'm gonna fade away
War, children
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
War, children
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away

Oh, see the fire is sweeping
Down through the streets today
Burning like a bright red carpet
Another fool who lost the way
Rape, murder
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Rape, murder
It's just a kiss away
It's just a kiss away
Yeah
Oh, see the storm is threatening
My very life today

 Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme
In the place, through which we wander
Reason turned around
And every fool
Will see his madness drowned
And every truth is swallowed up
By ... is giving ground
What you have lost can never be found
Words are just dust in deserts of sound
Everything is lost and your choice lies broken
And the truth is drowned
I watch
Surrender
Because I know
...
Now I know you will not see
The madness we have seen
Now I know you cannot be
All that your fright has been
What you have lost can never be found
Words are just dust in deserts of sound
Everything is lost and your choice lies broken
And the truth is drowned
Words are just dust
I stood but you just could not wait
Behind
Because I know you cannot be
All that your fright has been
What you have lost can never be found
Words are just dust in deserts of sound
Everything is lost and your choice lies broken
And the truth is drowned
Everything is lost in the giving ground
Everything is lost
Everything is lost in the giving ground
Turned around
Reason, turned around
In the giving ground
Ground
In the giving ground
Everything is lost
In the giving ground




 The cracks appear along the wall wall wall wall wall
See the people stoop back, once stood tall tall tall tall tall
I see the buildings crumble see the empires fall
But I see no more and I don't recall
Because I see
Nothing but the good things
Because I see
Nothing but the good things
Because I see
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good good good
Nothing but the good things
Well nothing ventured nothing lost
Count the changes count the cost
A reformation so uncertain
Keep your station draw the curtain
Because out there the snipers work the ridges
Building bombs and blowing bridges
Out there on a darkened road
The lines are dead and the cars explode
But in here
There's nothing but the good things
In here
Nothing but the good things
In here
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good good good good good
Nothing but the good things
I see a green sea a pleasant land land land land land
Nothing legal underhand
On the fence or in the sand
Well I take no chances and I take no stand
Against the wall
Against the wire
Against the fall
Against the fire
Against the sale
Against the hire
They say the profits high
But I know the cost is higher
Still I see
Nothing but the good things
Still I see
Nothing but the good things
Still I see here see do talk see
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good good good good good
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good things
Nothing but the good good good good things
No!




 Lay me down the long white line
Leave the sirens far behind me
Paint my name in black and gold
My heart, my flame, my heart, my road
My heartland fade across the line
Heartland sing the faces shining
In the failing, failing, failing
Heartland make the places mine
Clearly now the past mistakes
The giant steps we had to take
The path that ever promise made to
Die in dream dissolve and fade
My heartland, heartland, heartland 
Behind the lines a face that glimmers
Still looking for a face that shines
In the promise in the places
I'm going to make them mine
My heartland, heartland, heartland 




 The sun shines on the aluminium
I guess this must be the home of the hitmen




 Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go I want to be sedated
Nothing to do and no where to go-o-oh I want to be sedated
Just get me to the airport put me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers I can't control my brain
Oh no no no no no

Just put me in a wheelchair get me to the show
Hurry hurry hurry before I go loco
I can't control my fingers I can't control my toes
Oh no no no no no

Just get me to the airport put me on a plane
Hurry hurry hurry before I go insane
I can't control my fingers I can't control my brain
Oh no no no no no

Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I want to be sedated




 You say stay and never leave
You say meant for ever
I could believe you, but I don't
You say we're almost all alone together
All alone
You say
You say you will
I know you won't
CHORUS
I was wrong
I was wrong to ever doubt
I can get along without
I can love my fellow man
But I'm damned if I'll love yours
In a bar that's always closing
In a world where people shout
I don't wanna talk this over
I don't wanna talk it out
I was quite impressed until I hit the floor
Isn't that what friends are for?
Pain looks great on other people
That's what they're for
CHORUS
(Repeat 1)

 Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of auburn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
Your smile is like a breath of spring
You voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene
He talks about you in his sleep
There's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can
You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me, Jolene
I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you please don't take my man
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him just because you can

 Mama take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark too dark to see
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Mama wipe this blood from my face
I'm sick and tired of all this war
There's a long hard feelin' and it's hard to chase
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Mama put these guns to the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
There's a long black train and it's comin' round
Feels like knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door




 The lights shine clear through the sodium haze
The night draws near and daylight fades
Ignore the voices discard the day
For the brand new darkness for the bright new way
Hit
Well there have been better plans
But none that I could ever understand
Emerald signal the green on black
The lights say move say never look back
And so I find a place where I've never been seen
Find another place where the red turns green
Where the emerald glistens through the darkness again
Where the emerald glistens through the rain
The lights shine clear through the sodium haze
The night draws near and the daylight fades
But there's a voice in the distance quiet and clear
Saying something that I never ever wanted to hear
Well there have been better plans
But none that I could ever understand
I see the emerald signal see the green on black
I see the light say move say never look back
And so I find another place where I'll never been seen
Find another place where the red turns green
Where the emerald glistens through the darkness again
Where the emerald glistens through the rain rain rain
And I'm happy here
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain rain rain
I'm happy here
In the rain
Where the emerald
Glistens
Through the rain




 Watch them do
The falling over
Watch them do
The standing still
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more S....
(Women)
And the women come and go
(Talk)
Talking about me like they know
(Men)
Bought and sold
And the world keeps turning
People cold
And people burning
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more S....
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more S.... (Amphetamine Logic)
Hit up
Steel in hand
Lit up
Like candles
Burning
Like Catherine wheels
Turning
On
Nothing but the knife to live for
One life, all I need
Give me one good reason
Give me more S.... (Amphetmine Logic)




 Train...
Train...
Train...
Train...
Take a walk downtown to where the victims go
Take a last decision and the cars to move it
Past information
Tunnel vision and the scars to prove it
Everybody got a reservation
Far beyond the black horizon
Beyond the things you know
Everybody got a destination
Everybody got a place to go
Take a walk downtown to where the victims go
Take your shadow to the end to the very last window
Everybody got friends got shot upside and over
Down the line
Everybody got assignations
I got mine...
Take a railway track to the main attraction
Cut a hole between the ground and sky
Take a one way ticket to the pain reaction
Cross my heart and take a ride
Far beyond the black horizon
Beyond the things you know
Everybody got a destination
Everybody got a place
To go...




 Louie Louie, me gotta go. Louie Louie, me gotta go
A fine girl, she wait for me. Me catch the ship across the sea
I sailed the ship all alone. I never think I'll make it home
Louie Louie, me gotta go
Three nights and days we sailed the sea. Me think of girl constantly
On the ship, I dream she there. I smell the rose in her hair
Louie Louie, me gotta go
Me see Jamacan moon above. It won't be long me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then I tell her I never leave again
Louie Louie, me gotta go

 I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down...
I hear empire down...
I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Love lost, fire at will
Dum-dum bullets and shoot to kill, I hear
Dive, bombers, and
Empire down...
Empire down...
I hear the sons of the city and dispossessed
Get down, get undressed
Get pretty but you and me
We got the kingdom, we got the key
We got the empire, now as then
We don't doubt, we don't take direction
Lucretia, my reflection, dance the ghost with me...
We look hard
We look through
We look hard to see for real
Such things I hear, they don't make sense
I don't see much evidence
I don't feel
I don't feel
I don't feel
A long train held up by page on page
A hard reign held up by rage
Once a railroad
Now it's done...
I hear the roar of the big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down...
We got the empire, now as then
We don't doubt, we don't take reflection
Lucretia, my direction, dance the ghost with me...




 In a sea of faces, in a sea of doubt
In this cruel place your voice above the maelstrom
In the wake of this ship of fools I'm falling further down
If you can see me, Marian, reach out and take me home...

I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the
Grave...
Marian

Marian, there's a weight above me
And the pressure is all too strong
To breathe deep
Breathe long and hard
To take the water down and go to sleep
To sink still further
Beneath the fatal wave
Marian I think I'm drowning
This sea is killing me

I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the
Grave...

Was ich kann und was ich könnte
Weiss ich gar nicht mehr
Gib mir wieder etwas Schönes
Zieh mich aus dem Meer
Ich höre dich rufen, Marian
Kannst du mich schreien hören
Ich bin hier allein
Ich höre dich rufen, Marian
Ohne deine Hilfe verliere ich mich in diesem Ort

I hear you calling Marian
Across the water, across the wave
I hear you calling Marian
Can you hear me calling you to
Save me, save me, save me from the
Grave...
Marian




 Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more
I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know
I want more
I want more
(And I need all the love that I can't get to)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get to)
D'you get scared to feel so much?
To let somebody touch you?
So hot, so cold, so far so out of control
Hard to come by, and harder to hold
Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more
I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
I want more
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get to)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get to)
There are parts of me that don't get nervous
Not the parts that shake
You won't get what you deserve
You are what you take
Learning to cry for fun and profit
I'm not done yet
Counterfeit dollars or the English zloty
Anything I can get
Some people get by
With a little understanding
Some people get by
With a whole lot more
I don't know
Why you gotta be so undemanding
One thing I know
I want more
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get to)
(And I need all the love I can get)
(And I need all the love that I can't get to)
All the love that you can get
All the love
That I can't get to...




 We serve an old man in a dry season
A lighthouse keeper in the desert sun
Dreamers of sleepers and white treason
We dream of rain and the history of the gun
There's a lighthouse in the middle of Prussia
A white house in a red square
I'm living in films for the sake of Russia
A Kino Runner for the DDR
And the fifty-two daugthers of the revolution
Turn the gold to chrome
Gift... Nothing to lose
Stuck inside of Memphis with the mobile home, sing:
Mother Russia
Mother Russia
Mother Russia rain down down down
Mother Russia
Mother Russia
Mother Russia rain down




 I had a face on the mirror
I had a hand on the gun
I had a place in the sun and a
Ticket to Syria
I had everything within my reach
I had money and stuff
Each and every call
Too much but never enough
Tear it up and watch it fall




 I had a face on the mirror
I had a hand on the gun
I had a place in the sun and a
Ticket to Syria
I had everything within my reach
I had money and stuff
Each and every call
Too much but never enough
Tear it up and watch it fall




 And when your nerves break your thought
And my word break your will
And the heart break me over this wheel
They are coming down
Wait for
Hand in hand in hand in hand
They are coming down
Wait for
They are coming down
But we will
Never never never land
I had a face on the mirror
I had a hand on the gun
I had a place in the sun and a
Ticket to Syria
I had everything within my reach
I had money and stuff
Each and every call
Too much but never enough
Tear it up and watch it fall
They are coming down
Wait for
Hand in hand in hand in hand
They are coming down
Wait for
They are coming down
But we will
Never never land
With our backs to the sky
And our eyes on the ground
With the clouds far below
No horizon around
With the wind in our face
And our arms open wide
We will pass through this place
To the other side
All the days of our lives
All the ways of our calling
Follow...
I had a face on the mirror
I had a hand on the gun
I had a place in the sun and a
Ticket to Syria
I had everything within my reach
I had money and stuff
Each and every call
Too much but never enough
Tear it up and watch it fall




 And it's passing strange
And I'm waiting for the train
Caught up on this line again
And it's passing slowly
Killing time
But it's better than living in what will come
And I've still got some of your letters with me
And I Thought sometimes
Or I read too much
And I think you know
Let's drink to the dead lying under the water
And the cost of the blood on the driven snow
And the lipstick on my cigarettes
Frost upon the window pane
Nine while nine and I'm waiting
For the train.....
She said do you remember a time when angels
Do you remember a time when fear
In the days when I was stronger
In the days when you were here
She said when days had no beginning
While days had no end
When shadows grew no longer
I knew no other friend but you
Were wild
You were wild.....
Frost upon these cigarettes
Lipstick on the window pane
And I've lost all sense of the world outside
But I can't forget so I call your name
And I'm looking for a life for me
And I'm looking for a life for you
And I'm talking to myself again
And it's so damn cold it's just not true
And I'm walking
Through the rain
Trying to hold on
Waiting for the train
And I'm only looking
For what you want
But it's lonely here
And I think you knew
And I'm...
And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine and I'm waiting
For the train..... (repeat last verse x2)




 It's just a feeling
I get sometimes
A feeling
Sometimes
And I get frightened
Just like you
I get frightened too
But it's...
CHORUS
(no no no) No time for heartache
(no no no) No time to run and hide
(no no no) No time for breaking down
(no no no) No time to cry
Sometimes in the world as is you've
Got to shake the hand that feeds you
It's just like Adam says
It's not so hard to understand
It's just like always coming down on
Just like Jesus never came and
What did you expect to find
It's just like always here again it's...
CHORUS
Everything will be alright
Everything will turn out fine
Some nights I still can't sleep
And the voices pass with time
And I keep
(repeat)
No time for tears
No time to run and hide
No time to be afraid of fear
I keep no time to cry
CHORUS




 Now the ground comes up too fast
Too fast to meet you
In clouds of dust erupting
Thick around your feet, be careful
In the rubble in waiting
Wall to wall where you tread
Now the quick and the dead and the same old
Fates come calling cards away
How do you think it came to pass you
By the hard way by desire
How do you think it came to pass you by?
On the wire
I don't sleep so I don't dream
So I don't wake up frightened
Everything is what it seems if
You look deep enough tonight and
See.....
On the wire
On the wire
On the wire
I will not fall
On the wire
On the wire
On the wire
I will not fall
On the wire
On the wire
On the wire
I will not fall
On the wire
On the wire
On the wire
I will not fall
On the wire
On the wire
On the wire
I will not fall
On the wire
On the wire
On the wire
I will not fall




 




 Behind the door
The poison door
We search the still hours
Looking
For a place to hide(For a place to hide)
Behind the door
Where dreams collide(Where dreams collide)
Behind the door
The poison door
We sit in silence waiting
For a deadly friend
Behind the door
Where dreams descend(Where dreams descend)
And the shadows smile
Lips dark and wild
The shadows smile
And kiss the sky
Behind the door
The poison door
The puppets dance on a burning floor
Like dying flames
Behind the door
Shoot me down again
(repeat to first break)
And kiss your memory goodbye
And the shadows smile
But their lips are ssss...
And the shadows smile
Lips dark and wild
And the shadows smile
Kiss your memory goodbye
And the shadows smile
Lips dark and wild
And kiss the sky




 Carrion child
Prey for me,play your
Wild card, see the house come down around your
Head, home to me, so much dreaming
Some say I'm growing cold and
Taking over
Nothing, cuts, two ways.....
Possession: taking over
Stand these pictures on your shelf
And wear your heart upon my sleeve
Wear a dress that you can see through
See yourself inside;
I'll be your imagination
Tear apart what you believe
Make a mess of your conviction
Take away my pride and leave
Nothing, but the debris
Cuts, two ways
Carrion child
Prey for me, play your
Wild card, see the house come down around your
Possession: taking over.....
Possession: shake shake shake shake shake shake;
Possession: taking over.....
Somehow the fact takes over, and the fiction coming through
Somehow I do my crying breaking down for you
This way doubt takes over, contradiction coming through
This way I do my lying, making up and making out for you.....
Possession: taking over
Child (nothing)
Prey for me (but the debris)
Play your wild card (cuts two ways)
Some say I'm growing cold and
Taking over.....Down around your
Head (nothing)
Home to me (but the debris)
So much dreaming, see the house come down around your
Possession: shake shake shake shake shake shake shake
Possession: taking over.....
Possession: shake shake shake shake shake shake shake
Possession: taking hold




 I'm lying on my back now
The stars look all too near
Flowers on the razor wire
I know you're here
We are few and far between
I was thinking about her skin
Love is a many splintered thing
Don't be afraid now
Just walk on in
(Flowers on the razor wire)
(Walk on in)
Her eyes were cobalt red
Her voice was cobalt blue
I see no purple light
Crashing out of you
So just walk on in
(Flowers on the razor wire)
(Walk on in)
Her lovers queued up in the hallway
I heard them scratching at the door
I tried to tell her
About Marx and Engels, God and angels
I don't really know what for
But she looked good in ribbons
So just walk on in
She looked good in ribbons
So just walk on in
Tie a red, red, red, red, red, red ribbon
Love is a many splintered thing
Tie a red, red, red, red ribbon
Don't be afraid
Just walk on in
Just walk on in
(Incoming...)
(Incoming...)
Just walk on in
Just walk on in
Flowers on the razor wire
Just walk on in...
Incoming!




 It's just a heartbeat
Loud
In a small apartment
Loud
In another life
Another
And Romeo won't understand 'til she
Yield in the palm of his hand
Juliet turn the tv on and
Wait
'Til the night is over
Somebody phone
Somebody ring the doorbell
No-one home
And Romeo won't understand 'til he
Piss blood in the palm of his hand
Juliet turn the tv down and
Sleep
'Til the morning's over
'Til the boy is gone
'Til the body's gone
'Til the boy is gone
Somebody phone
Somebody ring the doorbell
No-one home
One Romeo down




 And yes I believe in what we had
But words got in the way
And only yesterday
As I was leaving
Lord knows I've tried to say but I've
Heard a million conversations
Going where they've been before
Seen the way that careful lingers
Undecided at the door
And all I know for sure
All I know for real
Is knowing doesn't mean so much
When placed against the feeling
The heat inside
When bodies meet
When fingers touch
All my words are secondhand and
Useless in the face of this
Rationale and rhyme and reason
Pale beside a single kiss
And I've heard so many things I
Fail to understand at all
I'd settle anytime for
Unknown footsteps in the hall outside
And all I know for sure
All I know for real
Is knowing doesn't mean so much
When placed against the feeling
The heat inside
When bodies meet
When fingers touch
Because the world is cruel and
Promises are broken
Don't try to tell me
Anything don't try to tell me
You'll be true to me you know the
Real truth is never spoken
And I know the world is cold but
If you hold on tight to what you
Find you might not mind too much though
Even this must pass away and
Memories may last for years but
Names are just for souvenirs
Some kind of angel let me
Look into your eyes
Don't give me whys and wherefores
Reason or surprise
I don't care for words that don't belong
And I don't care what you're called
Tell me later if at all
I can wait a long long time
Before I hear another love song
Come here I think you're beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful
Some kind of angel come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
My door is open wide
Some kind of stranger come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside
Come here I think you're beautiful
I think you're beautiful
Some kind of stranger come inside
(repeat last three verses to fade)




 All the things
We never needed
I don't need them now
All the things we ever did
Were always confidential
And hidden from me anyhow
You can stand all night
At a red light anywhere in town
Hailing maries left and right
But none of them slow down
I seen the best of men go past
I don't want to be the last
Gimme something fast
God knows everybody needs
A hand in their decision
Some of us are not so sure
I seen his own held out
For a ride on television
I think he's still in Baltimore
You can stand all night
At a red light anywhere in town
Hailing maries left and right
But none of them slow down
I seen the best of men go past
I don't want to be the last
Gimme something fast




 Talking at each other
Walking into walls
Walking into wishful
I've heard it all before
Another shade of empty
Another shade of blue
Another shade of yellow, sunset yellow
Another shade of you
Can make it summer
And make it shine
It's raining in the doorway
Paint your face once more
Paint the walls away now
I've seen it all before
Another shade of empty
Another shade of blue
Another shade of yellow, sunset yellow
Another shade of you
Can make it summer




 I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find
Follow me the wise man said
But he walked behind
I walked into a hospital
Where none were sick and none was well
When at night the Sisters left
I could not walk at all
Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpals make
Are you the teachers of my heart
We teach old hearts to break
A met a woman long ago
Her hair the black the black can go
Are you the teacher of the heart?
Soft she whispered, no
I met a girl across the sea
Her hair the gold that gold could be
Are you the teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee
I spent my hatred every place
On every work, on every face
Is my passion perfect
No! Do it once again
Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one
They laughed and laughed and laughed and said
Child are your lessons done?
I was handsome, I was strong
I knew the words of every song
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong




 In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls
As wide as lovers eyes
In the temple of love, shine like thunder
In the temple of love, cry like rain
In the temple of love, hear my calling
In the temple of love, hear my name
With the sunlight died and night above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another it's all the same
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside
With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain
You run for cover in the temple of love
Shine like thunder cry like rain
And the temple love grows old and strong
But the wind blows stronger cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before us
Black wind calls my name to you no more
In the black sky thunder sweeping
Underground and over water
Sounds of crying weeping will not save
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave
When stone is dust and only air remains
In the temple of love, shine like thunder
In the temple of love, cry like rain
In the temple of love, hear the calling
And the temple of love is falling
Down
With the fire from the fireworks up above me
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand
You run for cover in the temple of love
You run for another but still the same
For the wind will blow my name across this land
And the devil in black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away
(Extended Below)
In the temple of love, shine like thunder
In the temple of love, cry like rain
In the temple of love, hear my calling
In the temple of love, hear my name
In the black sky thunder sweeping
Underground and over water
Sounds of crying weeping will not save
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar
All your prayers must seem as nothing
Ninety-six below the wave
When stone is dust and only air remains
The only haven you can trust
And the devil in black dress watches over
My guardian angel walks away
Life is short and love is always over in the morning
Black wind come carry me far away
With the fire from the fireworks up above
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain
You run for cover in the temple of love
Shine like thunder cry like rain
And the temple grows old and strong
But the wind blows longer cold and long
And the temple of love will fall before
This black wind calls my name to you no more
In the temple of love you hide together
Believing pain and fear outside
But someone near you rides the weather
And the tears he cried will rain on walls
As wide as lovers eyes
In the temple of love, shine like thunder
In the temple of love, cry like rain
In the temple of love, hear the calling
And the temple of love is falling
Down




 Somebody tell me about the rhythm of the 4th floor
Somebody tell me about the rhythm of the dance floor
Somebody tell me about the perfect bomb
The royal valley on a blitzkrieg bomb
Somebody tell me how to use my gun tools
Kiss the napalm in the afternoon
I saw the film, I saw the place
I live to work for the killing sake
When I think you're knocked, when the radio died
And the rhythm played from every side
See the rebel and the damage done
See the debris and the damage done
See the wreckage and the damage done
See the film, see the damage done
Somebody tell me about the rhythm of the 4th floor
(This is the image, this is the place)
Somebody tell me about the rhythm of the dance floor
(This is the way the world will end)
Somebody tell me about the ...
(The waltzing man have dancing eyes)
I need to know about the ...
(This is the way the world will end)
Me I'm lost and the radio's dead
Now I'm relaxed and the radio's dead
The rhythms gone, the radio's dead
And the damage done inside my radio

 And now the torch
And shadows lead
Were it not so black and not so hard to see
How can it help you when you don't know what you need
How can anybody set you free?
Would he walk upon the water
If he couldn't walk away?
And would you
Would you carry the torch
For me?
And what if I gave you the key
To the doors of your design...
Lit the corridors of desire?
And were it not so black
And not so hard to see
What use to you then any fire?
Would he walk upon the water
If he couldn't walk away?
And would you
Carry the torch for me?
Would he walk upon the water
If he couldn't walk away?
And would you
Would you carry the torch for me?
Would you carry the torch
For me?
Would you carry the torch
For me?
Would you carry the torch
For me?




 Take a last decision and the cars to move it
Past information
Tunnel vision and the scars to prove it
Everybody got a reservation
Far beyond the black horizon
Beyond the things you know
Everybody got a destination
Everybody got a place to go
Take a walk downtown to where the victims go
Take your shadow to the end to the very last window
Everybody got friends got shot upside and over down the line
Everybody got assignations
I got mine
Take a one way ticket to the main attraction
Cut a hole between the ground and sky
Take a railway track to a chain reaction
Cross my heart and take a ride
Far beyond the black horizon
Beyond the things you know
Everybody got a destination
Everybody got a place to go




 You don't have to say you're sorry
To look on further down the line
Into the sun
Too close at heaven
Love is fine
But you can't hold it like a ...
Two worlds apart and two together
Into that good night kiss away
One takes the hard
One the other
Kiss a way
Are you living for love?
Are you living for love?
When the road gets too tough
Is your love strong enough?
(are you living?)
(are you living for love?)
Do you feel your head is full of thunder?
Questions never end?
Empty nights alone? no wonder
It all comes back again
Are you living for love?
Are you living for love?
I've been under the gun
I've lost and I've ...
(one, two, three, four ...)
Forget the many steps to heaven
It never happened and it ain't so hard
Happiness is a loaded weapon and a
Short cut is better by far
Explosive bolts, ten thousand volts
At a million miles an hour
Abrasive wheels and molten metals
It's a semi-automatic, get in the car
Corrosive heart and frozen heat
We're worlds apart where we could meet
Where the street fold round and the motors start
And the idiot wields the power
Where the chosen hold the highest card
On the field of honour where the ground is hard
So the highest hand is joking wild
And the house soon fold and no-one stand
I put my finger on and dialled
The tower, the moon, the gun, and
Nine nine nine, singer down
Cloudburst and all around
The first are last, the blessed get wired
The best is yet to come
I put my finger on and fired
Heat-seeking, out of the sun
You can set the controls for the heart or the knees
And the meek'll inherit what they damn well please
Get ahead, go figure, go ahead and pull the trigger
Everything under the gun




 The razor bites and the shriek subsides
He arches clutching at his sides
Across the floor across the tiles
The man is dead and the razor smiles
A shiny love song a quick incision
Cut him down on television
A people come to this
Beyond the age of reason
A people fed on famine
A people on their knees and
People eat each other
A people stand in line
Waiting for another war and
Waiting for my valentine
For a million empty faces
For a million hollow smiles
Cancer for my education
Watch the body hit the files
Waiting for another war and
Waiting for my valentine




 *sniff*
Twenty-five whores in the room next door
Twenty-five floors and I need more
I'm looking for the can in the candy store
Two thousand Hamburg four
And colours I ain't seen before
It's a small world and it smells funny
I'd buy another if it wasn't for the money
Take back what I paid
For another motherfucker in a motorcade
In a long black car
With the prettiest shit
From Panama
When the sirens wail
And the lights flash blue
My vision thing come
Slamming through
It's a small world and it smells bad
I'd buy another if I had
Back
What I paid
For another motherfucker in a motorcade
Slamming through
Slamming through
What do we need to make our world come alive?
What does it take to make us sing?
While we're waiting for the next one to arrive?
One million points of light
One billion dollar Vision Thing
Another black hole in the killing zone
A little more mad in the methedrome
One blinding flash of sense
Just like the president's
Well, I don't mind
Out of my mind
Blizzard king
Bring it on home
It's a small world and it smells bad
I'd buy another if I had
Back
What I paid
For another motherfucker in a motorcade
And a vision thing
And a vision thing
And a ...
Sha la la la
What do we need to make our world come alive?
What do we need to make us sing?
While we're waiting for the next one to arrive?
One million points of light
One billion dollar Vision Thing
Sha la la la




 And in the summer when the clouds show through
I might go the same way too if
You and I could talk together
Well, what am I supposed to do with
You and I would walk together
Then with always close around and
Now you gaze toward the doorway
When the weather comes falling down
CHORUS
And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay?
Would you choose to walk?
Would you choose to stay?
Would you
Walk walk walk walk walk away
(away) (away) away away (away) away
Away away walk away
Would you choose to walk away?
And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay?
Would you choose to walk?
Would you choose to stay?
Would you
Walk walk walk walk walk away
Though when the day is nearly through
I might see the same way too if
You would name the things that bring you down
On me so I could say it's
Not quite true if you don't really
Know or understand the circumstance
Behind then I might clear your mind
And you won't have to go, so...
CHORUS




 Looking out the morning I can see the trees, turn orange in the rays
Don't need the smell of incense, in the morning haze
Head on down the delta, in the shadow of the sun
Seven shades of Shiva rising, I am come
Wah-hoo
Let's do the war on drugs
Wah-hoo
Let's do the war on drugs
Seven shades of shiva rising
Let's do the war on drugs
Looking out the morning I can see the trees, turn orange in the rays
Don't need the smell of incense, in the morning haze
Head on back to Kirkstall, in the shadow of the sun
Seven shades of Shiva rising, I am come
Wah-hoo
Let's do the war on drugs
Wah-hoo
Let's do the war on drugs
Eleven (... /ten /nine /eight /seven) shades of shiva rising
Let's do the war on drugs




 Here's the story
No time to lose (like the present)
Now I've lost my friends
Now I've lost friends
It's not my party
Never will be
Feeling out-of-place
I'm not happy
A touch of the storm cloud...
Roughage in a comradeship and conversations
Conversations, everything's so run-of-the-mill
We stand still...
And time slips back
And time slips back...
Back to the garden
Time slips back
Back in the dark rooms
Time slips back
Back in the dark room
Back to the dark age
Put me on the rack
We stand still
Time slips back
Recount movements
Recount movements
Watch us grow
Watch us fall from grace
Watch us fall flat on our face
But you always fall on your feet
Tell me how you always
Fall on your feet
Tell me how
Tell me how
Tell me how
Oh tell me how




 Counting the days in the haze around you
Susanne on the wall
No pain, summer rain
I'm lost for stupid again
We are the same
Give it a name Susanne
Counting the days in the haze around you
Susanne let the ether fall
Out of phase, I am all around you
Susanne on the wall
No pain, summer rain
I'm lost for stupid again
We are the same
Give it a name Susanne




 When you don't see me...
It's not a matter of going to grow
It's not a matter of time or how I feel
I'm throwing off the shadow of a better man now
What you see is what you never had
Get real
Get another
I don't exist when you don't see me
I don't exist when you're not here
What the eye don't see won't break the heart
You can make believe when we're apart
But when you leave I disappear
When you don't see me...
Oh, it's kind of different when you're there
You can lease the peace of mind
You bought a mask, I put it on
You never thought to ask me
If I wear it when you're gone
Get real
Get another
I don't exist when you don't see me
I don't exist when you're not here
What the eye don't see won't break the heart
You can make believe when we're apart
But when you leave I disappear
When you don't see me...
You never learned
You bought me
Everything and less
I turned
You couldn't let me move
I guess, I don't deny, it don't disprove
What you see is what you lost
If I were you I wouldn't try
Get real
Get another
I don't exist when you don't see me
I don't exist when you're not here
What the eye don't see won't break the heart
You can make believe when we're apart
But when you leave I disappear
When you don't see me...

 Something will happen here
I can feel it
On the howling edge of pink and white and blue
Something, right here
I can feel it
And now it's just too real to
Still believe in you
And will I ...dream?
When it's over will I dream?
When it's over will I?
When it's happened will I?
When it's over will I dream?
Something is happening here
I can feel it
On the howling edge of pink and white and baby -
Will I ...dream?
When it's over will I dream?
When it's over will I?
When it's happened will I?
When it's over will I dream?
Something has happened here
I can feel it
On the howling edge of pink and white and steely blue
Something, right here
I can feel it
And now it's just too real
To will belief in you
And will I ...dream?
When it's over will I dream?
When it's over will I?
When it's happened will I?
When it's over will I dream?




 All God's children give good phone
I called Jesus, he's not home so
I'm so pleased to talk to you
Trees and walks, I love them too
Threatened species, they adore me
Flower children never bore me
But all the things you share are
Better left unsaid
When you can give me head
And run your fingers through my hair
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, You could be the one
We can meditate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
Let's call it fate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
To get your flowers pressed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
Just get undressed
I'm so glad to find you here
Mystic people, they're so dear
I don't like the rest, your sign's the best
Whatever it is I'm most impressed
I don't need to understand
The laying on of hands
I'm in a hurry to get my karma straight
'Cause life is short and I can't wait
But don't worry about the state
Of this pretty little thing in the armour plate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, You could be the one
We can meditate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
Let's call it fate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
To get your flowers pressed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
Just get undressed
I'm so pleased that you believe
Now open up a little let the good times heave
We're going for a ride
Destiny can't be denied
But all those precious things are better left unsaid
When you can give me hair
And run your fingers though my head
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, You could be the one
We can meditate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
Let's call it fate
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
To get your flowers pressed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you could be the one
Just get undressed
Love
Is all you need
