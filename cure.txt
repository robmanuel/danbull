10.15 on the saturday night
And the tap drips
Under the strip light
And I'm sitting
In the kitchen sink
And the tap drips

Drip 

Waiting
For the telephone to ring
And I'm wondering
Where she's been
And I'm crying
For yesterday
And the tap drips


It's always the same




 10:15 on a Saturday night
And the tap drips under the strip light
And I'm sitting in the kitchen sink
And the tap drips
Drip drip drip...
Waiting for the telephone to ring
And I'm wondering where she's been
And I'm crying for yesterday
And the tap drips
Drip drip drip...
It's always the same

 So I'll wait for you
Where I always wait
Behind the signs that sell the news
I'll watch for you like yesterday
And hope for you
One day that once
Spent out on me
And up 'til late
I search for you
Your hat pushed straight
Away from me
Your measured step
Heads up you win
Always too late
If I could just once catch your eye
Invisible against the words
That hold you down in solitude
And never let you go
The way that every time
My eyes just close
Like lids of wooden men in file
I put you under rainy day
Your hat's all off
And I'm gone away

 So the fire is almost out
And there's nothing left to burn
I've run right out of thoughts
And I've run right out of words
As I used them up
I used them up
Yea, the fire is almost cold
And there's nothing left to burn
I've run right out of feeling
And I've run right out of world
And everything I promised
And everything I tried
Yea, everything I ever did

I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
But the fire is almost out
Is almost out
And there's nothing left to burn
No there's nothing left to burn
Not even this

And the fire is almost dead
And there's nothing left to burn
I've finished everything, yeah
And all the things I promised
And all the things I tried
Yea, all the things I ever dreamed

I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
But the fire is almost out

Half my life I've been here
Half my life in flames
Using all I ever had
To keep the fire ablaze
To keep the fire ablaze
To keep the fire ablaze
To keep the fire ablaze
But there's nothing left to burn

No, there's nothing left to burn
And the fire is almost out
And the fire is almost out
And the fire is almost out
Almost out, almost out
Almost out, almost out
And there's nothing left to burn




 My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say

She was caught in a mudslide
Eaten by a lion
Got run over by a crappy purple Scion
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes!
She dried up in the desert
Drowned in a hot tub
Danced to death at an east side night club
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

I wanna live a thousand lives with you
I wanna be the one you're dying to love...
But you don't want to
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are I'm gonna say




 We sit in the same room
Side by side
I give you the wrong lines
Feed you

Accuracy 

Look into my eyes
We both smile
I could kill you
Without trying
That's accuracy

Accuracy 

Practice all day for accuracy
Mirror mirror on the wall

 Please wake up
It's so dark and cold
Please wake up
I feel so alone
And I feel so scared
That you're going away
And I feel so scared...
All I want is summer
Stories from before
Just like the day you tried to hide
Behind the churchyard wall
And fell asleep before I came...
I found you
In a chain of flowers
Sleeping like a marble girl
Sleeping in another world...
I'll never tell you
Of all the different ways
You make me so afraid...




 He breaks the spell
Still young and words from
Out this dream of life and leaves us
Sleeping stone rack
Lying consumed by
Phantom pains
And displays of greed
He slips from out this shadowland
And pain where heads grow soft and grey
And age destroys all hope
And spirits crush the men
And hide away
The wordless watch the soft sky smile
And breathless hear the low wind sigh
What death will join
No more let love divide
'Dream yourself awake' he calls
'An eternity awaits us all
Open your eyes and be with me
Be with me...'
He breaks the chains
So young disspells
The hateful shades
Of treacherous time
Leaves us sleeping
Tortured mute
Devoured by ghosts
And dreams of life
Slips through ties
And dust to be the world
We dream he lives apart
But everything we feel
The young and beautiful
And brave of heart
The wordless watch the soft sky smile
And breathless hear the low wind sigh
What death will join
No more let love divide
'Dream yourself awake' he calls
'An eternity awaits us all
Open your eyes and be with me
Be with me...'
'Dream yourself awake' he calls
'An eternity awaits us all
Open your eyes and be with me
Be with me forever...'




 Christabel strips
And slips like a dream
Breaking ice with arms that gleam with pain
Disdain...
She throws her head
And glides against the stream
Throwing me her bravest smile
Defiant
Glittering
Shivering guile
"Catching a cold is quick this time
But fish?...
Fish may take a while... "
Christabel dips and slips from me
And hand pushed deep inside is suddenly free
Triumphant
Reluctantly
Struggling six legs held up for me to see
"Don't be so scared
It's nothing new
It's the same old game
Only fun with two... "
But fast and over and over
"I can't play this game with you"
Everything she tries to tell me
Leaves me open mouthed and still
Foolishly arrange tomorrow
The way I always will
Christabel trips
And grips my hand
But never to be saved...
For a second I understand
And I fall with her...
"I'll never leave you
Love you
See you change into the man I want
But it's not for long this thing
It's not for long... "




 Come closer and see
See into the trees
Find the girl while you can
Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes
Just follow your eyes

I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees
Into the trees

Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again

 One more glare
The moonlight fools
It feels so bad
It feels this good
Baby baby baby
Upside down
Baby baby
Chase me round and round
Baby baby baby
Inside out
Wake me up
With a hand inside my mouth
Stuck and hooked
An inch away from the floor
Six sides to every lie I tell
Maybe more
The american voice
American voice again
It was never quite like this before
It was never quite like this before
Baby baby baby
Chase me down
Baby baby baby
Round and round
Baby baby baby
Inside out
Wake me up
With shame
Baby baby baby
Upside down
Baby baby
Chase me round and round
Baby baby baby
Inside out
Wake me up
With a hand inside my mouth




 I'm going back to the land of the blind
Back to the land where the sun never shines
I'm going back there and I'm hoping to find
Everything just as it was before
I left it all behind
I slept at nights there hysterically
Twisted and turned
But I just couldn't get free
Opened my eyes
But I still couldn't see
But I could feel her...
China white girl
So I get down on the floor
Like I am worshipping God
Burning like a monkey
I get down on the floor
Like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey
Mmmmmm...
That was a Japanese dream alright
The sound of the storm
And the flickering light
And the way that her scent used to fill up the night like...
Like her scent used to fill up the night
So I get down on the floor
Like I am worshipping God
Burning like a monkey
I get down on the floor
Like I am praying to the Lord
Burning like a monkey
Just look at me now
Just look at me this way
It looks like I am quite insane
It looks like I am trying to eat off my face
It looks like I'm going to the land of the blind anyway...
Back where the sun never shines
Back to the land of the blind
Back in a Japanese dream

 Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there are worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

So, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

And every time I try to pick it up
Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands
But there's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
At all




 Oh Elise it doesn't matter what you say

 I never thought that i would find myself
In bed amongst the stones
The columns are all men
Begging to crush me
No shapes sail on the dark deep lakes
And no flags wave me home

In the caves
All cats are grey
In the caves
The texture coats my skin
In the death cell
A single note
Rings on and on and on




 Pulling this watch as faces go
Pulling in a word and done it slow this other time
I see your face is silent
Oh, we go away and play
What have you done
Takes a feeling inside us all
Continue out with just one push in my mouth
But you're so close now
And you're so close now
All i have to do is three short blows
All that still is best inside
The full when the wall
And you don't even know
And the other faces here with me
The others dressed in summers thing
If only one way is to be beautiful
If only one way is to the other song
And every time it's you, it's like the blood on the stairs is sent away
And every time we see it's all said before you
If only the ways to kill you
You used to say this fear of drowning
Fear no death by water
Father walks in at the foot of the bed
Six of you want to see you safe
Just one time you'll meet this man
All you've got to do is kill her
And all you've got to do is kill her
Trickle the sands against and pull the animals
Just out of the womb
Seeing the cow dead before he was born
It's the man he, he loved
The solid pieces fell on the ground
He couldn't kill another life
He couldn't kill another life
He couldn't kill another life
It's all been painted with love
It could have been some friends
Pulling strings to meet you
All i want to do is reach it
She says 'let go my shoulder!'
See the sky!
And the sky goes black
And the sky goes black
I just want to feel her
I just want to feel her
I just want you to feel it
I just want you to feel it
Everytime i looked up the stairs
I used to see her die
She would move so slow
Anyone could've been but she was a cat
Anyone could've been she was a cat
Pulling away as i used to fight
That's just playing so low
That ugly or pretty
The face stays the same
Her face stays the same
Her face stays the same
The ugly or pretty
Her face stays the same, stays the same, stays the same
And looking on the final walls
And looking on the final walls
Did you now find this malice out
The angels fall
Let's make some more ('noise'?)
Let's make some more ('noise'?)
Help me be your mother for just one day
Let's fall in churches far outside
They used to love they used to love...




 Tonight I'm feeling like an animal
Tonight I'm howling inside
Tonight I'm feeling like an animal
Tonight I'm going wild

And all I want is to be with you again
And all I want is to hold you like a doll
And all I want is to be with you again
With you again
Just to hold you like a doll

Tonight I'm screaming like an animal
Tonight I'm losing control
Tonight I'm screaming like an animal
Tonight oh I'm getting so low

And all I want is to be with you again
And all I want is to hold you like a doll
And all I want is to be with you again
With you again
Just to hold you like a doll
That's all I want
That's all I want
Just to hold you like a doll
That's all I want
Like a doll
That's all I want
That's all I want
Just to hold you like a doll
That's all I want
Just to hold you like a doll
That's all I want
All I want
Just to hold you like a doll
All I want
Just to hold you like a doll

 Yeah, it's a big bright beautiful world
I just see other side of the door
Six billion beautiful faces
But I saw them all before

No, this is not about running out on you
Not a case of right or wrong
It's only that it's over and done for me
It's already been and gone

And I don't want another go around
I don't want to start again
No, I don't want another go around

I want this to be the end
I don't want to start again
I want this to be the last thing we do
It's for me and you

For all my dreams came true

Yeah, I know I should care if you come with me
Yeah, and I should care if you go
I really should care about your love or your hate of me
Yeah, I should care but I don't
And it's not about giving up on you
It's not a case of do or die
It's simply that it's over and out for me
There's no more room inside








This to be the last we go through
This to be the end
For all my dreams came true




 I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating
I was wrapped up in a blanket
I was grey
Damp and sore
The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic
(Like I think I'm at the racing
Like the night before)
I remember one girl standing
One was sitting on the ground
One was holding me up
The other pulling me down
And I couldn't decide which one was real
Because there wasn't a sound
(Like I was pregnant again... )
"Don't move don't blink don't think don't even breathe" she said
"Or the photograph will spoil
And cut you off at the head"
So I was sucking
I was sucking like a fat lady would
But I couldn't hold it down another second
(Bleagh!)
"Don't twitch don't shout don't think don't even breathe" she said
"Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head"
So I was sweating
I was sweating like a fat lady would...
And I woke up
With a man inside my mouth
(This won't hurt at all... )




 Say goodbye on a night like this
If it's the last thing we ever do
You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you
It goes dark
It goes darker, still
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away

I'm coming to find you, if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you
Your trust
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

Say hello on a day like today
Say it everytime you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you
It goes deep
It goes deeper, still
This touch
And the smile and the shake of your head

I’m coming to find you, if it takes me all night
Can’t stand here like this anymore
For always and ever is always for you
I want it to be perfect, like before

Oh ho ho, I want to change it all
Oh ho ho, I want one change ×2

 A year ago, today we stood
Above this same awakening world
I held you
You never wanted me to know
Another year ago, today
Before this same awakening world
I held you
I never meant to let you go
There was a moment
There always is
When time stood still
And always was this
One endless moment
You turn in pain
And I always let you go
Over and over again
A year ago, tonight we lay
Below this same remembering sky
I kissed you
You never wanted me to know
Another year ago, tonight
Behind the same remembering sky
I kissed you
I never meant to let you go
Another moment
There always is
As time stands still
And always is this
One endless moment
You tell me all
And I hold you and I kiss you
And I never let you go

I never let you go
Never let you go
I never let you go




 The sun rises slowly
On another day
The eastern sky grows
Cold
Winter in water colours
Shades of grey
Something
Something holds me
Holds me hypnotized

I stare at the window
Stare at the window
Waiting for the day
To go
Winter in water colours
Shades of grey




 




 He waits for her to understand
But she won't understand at all
She waits all night for him to call
But he won't call anymore

He waits to hear her say, "Forgive"
But she just drops her pearl-black eyes
And prays to hear him say, "I love you"
But he tells no more lies

He waits for her to sympathize
But she won't sympathize at all
She waits all night to feel his kiss
But always wakes alone
He waits to hear her say, "Forget"
But she just hangs her head in pain
And prays to hear him say, "No more
I'll never leave again"

How did we get this far apart?
We used to be so close together
How did we get this far apart?
I thought this love would last forever

 Rio sunrise
Sucking on a straw
I rub my head
And stagger out the door
And head into the bright new
Beautiful day
And the way she pulls me in
Sucks my breath away
I asked her for some time
And she just made me it
I asked her maybe why?
And she just gave me it
Never smile never stare
She doesn't seem to care at all
Never cry never scream
She doesn't really seem
To need me at all...
Fourteen weeks I stay away from home
A hundred days a part of me unknown
A part in pink
And perfect moments play
And as a wonder of the world
She sucks my breath away
I asked her for some time
And she just made me it
I asked her maybe why?
And she just gave me it
So I asked her could be heaven?
And she just prayed me it...
She didn't want to know my name
She didn't want to know
How long we had together
Spending time as if
Tomorrow never comes
I didn't want to know the end
I didn't want to go but
Slowly found me home again
And slow again tomorrow comes...
But it was all so far away
And so long ago
I hardly ever think about her anymore
Except sometimes
When the summer twilight breeze
Carries me the scent of faraway rain
I remember...
And she still sucks my breath away




 Instrumental




 Golden midnight taking us across the water
(line... Sounds vaguely like 'holy love sing we're falling close in every other')
As dawn breaks I wonder
Sun's growing cold
Ours is not to wonder
To never grow old
To never grow old
Oh ariel I (it?) will always feel right out here
(nearly unintelligible line)
Sister & brother
Never loved each other like this
(line)
And never fall
You never fall
Ariel




 Ariel
Golden midnight
Bringing us across the water
Holy love sing
We're falling close in every other
As dawn breaks I wonder
Sun's growing old
Ours is not to wonder
To never grow old
To never grow old
Oh Ariel
I will always feel right out here
The night is in sight
???
Sister and brother
Never loved each other like this
Jewels to another
Flowing water
And never fall
You never fall
Ariel
Ariel...




 Movement
No movement
Just a falling bird
Cold as it hits the bleeding ground
He lived and died
Catch sight
Cover me with earth
Draped in black
Static
White sound

A day without substance
A change of thought
An atmosphere that rots with time
Colors that flicker in water
A short term effect

Scream
As she tries to push him over
Helpless and sick
With teeth of madness
Jump jump dance and sing
Sideways across the desert
A charcoal face
Bites my hand
Time is sweet
Derange and disengage everything

A day without substance
A change of thought
An atmosphere that rots with time
Colors that flicker in water
A short term effect

A short term effect
A short term effect
An echo
And a stranger's hand
A short term effect
An echo
And a stranger's hand
A short term effect

 Give me your eyes that I might see
The blind man kissing my hands
The sun is humming
My head turns to dust as he plays on his knees
As he plays on his knees

And the sand
And the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
Sudden hush across the water
And we're here again

And the sand
And the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

My head falls backs
And the walls crash down
And the sky
And the impossible explode
Held for one moment I remember a song
An impression of sound
Then everything is gone
Forever

A strange day




 Give me your eyes, that I might see

Cherish the faces as they wait for the end

 For how much longer can I howl into this wind?
For how much longer can I cry like this?

A thousand wasted hours a day
Just to feel my heart for a second
A thousand hours just thrown away
Just to feel my heart for a second




 For how much longer can I howl into this wind?
For how much longer can I cry like this?
A thousand wasted hours a day
Just to feel my heart for a second
A thousand hours just thrown away
Just to feel my heart for a second
For how much longer can I howl into this wind?




 Sunk deep in the night
I sink in the night
Standing alone underneath the sky
I feel the chill of ice on my face
I watch the hours go by
The hours go by
You sleep
Sleep in a safe bed
Curled and protected
Protected from sight
Under a safe roof
Deep in your house
Unaware of the changes at night
At night
I hear the darkness breathe
I sense the quiet despair
Listen to the silence
At night
Someone has to be there
Someone must be there

Unaware of the changes at night

 Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever moves
I swim around in circles
In the same old lifeless room
And talk about the mirror man
The whispers in my ear again
The hot and sticky pillow man
Is smothering my face again
Nothing ever changes
Nothing ever moves
And I run around hysterical
In dead persistent gloom
And babble out in simile
Like dog-head-monkey-music me
Shut up shut up shut up shut up
Shut up!!!
And let me breathe...

 Curl into a ball like you have more fun
That would make it faster
Why do you do it do you act like you?
Don't fight
Go red and blue and black and white
Sell this sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun?
Put a piece of metal in your head you said
Make you dead
Make you hippa hippa hippa hippa

A palace of stones
Of your bananafish bones
I'll buy you a hundred years old
To celebrate our difference
Theorise and talk yourself
Until you're tired and old
Disappear everywhere and watch me
Pull my lips apart
Exploit inspire encourage
Be responsible for this
Ha ha

I don't think
I don't think
I make use of all this time
Oh kill me kiss me once
And then we'll throw it away



Turn off the lights
And tell me about the games you play




 Curl into a ball like you have more fun
That would make it faster
Why do you do it, do you do it, do you act like you?
Why do you do it, do you act like you?
Don't fight, go red and blue and black and white and sell this, sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun?
"Put a piece of metal in your head" you said
"Make you dead, make you hip-a, hip-a, hip-a, hip-a"
A palace of stones of your bananafishbones
I'd buy you a hundred years old
To celebrate our difference, theorise and talk yourself
Until you're tired and old
Disappear everywhere and watch me
Pull my lips apart
Exploit, inspire, encourage
Be responsible for this
I don't think, I don't think
I make use of all this time
Oh, kill me, kiss me once and then we'll throw it away
And then we'll throw it away
Curl into a ball like you have more fun
That would make it faster
Why do you do it, do you do it, do you act like you?
Why do you do it, do you act like you?
Don't fight, go red and blue and black and white and sell this sell this
Or leave it senseless like a suck on a gun?
"Put a piece of metal in your head" you said

I don't think, I don't think

Oh, kill me, kiss me once and then we'll throw it away
And then we'll throw it away
Tell me about the games you play
Oh, turn off the lights
And tell me about the games you play




 If you've got something left to say
You'd better say it now
Anything but "stay"
Just say it now
We know we've reached the end
We just don't know how
Well at least we'll still be friends
Yeah one last useless vow
There are different ways to live
Yeah I know that stuff
Other ways to give
Yeah all that stuff
But holding onto used to be
Is not enough
Memory's not life
And it's not love

We should let it all go
It never stays the same
So why does it hurt me like this
When you say that I've changed?
When you say that I've aged?
Say I'm afraid

And all the tears you cry
They're not tears for me
Regrets about your life
They're not regrets for me
It never turns out how you want
Why can't you see?
It all just slips away
It always slips away
Eventually
So if you've got nothing left to say
Just say goodbye
Turn your face away
And say goodbye
You know we've reached the end
You just don't know why
And you know we can't pretend
After all this time


But there are long long nights when I lay awake
And I think of what I've done
Of how I've thrown my sweetest dreams away
And what I've really become
And however hard I try
I will always feel regret
However hard I try
I will never forget




 Aow
Yea yea yea

The happiest day I ever knew
In a sea of gold down next to you
So blurred and tired under summer sun
You whispered dreams of a world to come
We were so in love
In this sea of gold so young and tired
Under summer sun hard by your side
Whispering dreams down next to you
We were so in love
The happiest day
Yea the happiest day I knew
The summer sun and sea of gold
This perfect day, so long ago
Whispering dreams so blurred and tired
We have to keep this day alive
Yea yea yea
Whispered dreams so young and tired
It's hard to hold this day inside
And the happiest night I ever had
Up next to you in silver sand
So scared and high under winter moon
You whispered dreams that would all come true
We were so in love
Up next to you so fucked and high
Under winter moon it made me cry
Whispering dreams on silver sand
We were so in love
The happiest night
Yea the happiest night I had
The winter moon and silver sand
This perfect night in another land
Whispering dreams so scared and high
We have to keep this night alive
Yea yea yea
Whispered dreams so fucked and high
It's hard to hold this night inside
Yea and every summer's sun I want again
And every winter's moon I want the same
My happiest day and my happiest night
Always next to you
And held deep inside

Keeps me alive




 The big hand makes all of your favourite things
Like all your dreams go small
And all your friends run away
Until your memories fail
And the words don't fit
But the way the big hand smiles
You just won't care about it
The big hand makes all of your favourite things
Like all your days run out
And all your hopes disappear
And your smiles just stop
And your eyes go dead
And the shadows start to crawl
In the back of your head
But when the big hand speaks
It's like fireworks and heaven
So you listen
Don't think
And wish for nothing at all
And when the big hand sings
It's like fireworks and friends
Leaving alone I'm not
Leaving alone
Leaving alone I'll never
Leave alone again
So when the big hand holds up all your favourite things
And with a touch like glass
Starts to squeeze
You don't ask
"Why me?"
You just slip to the floor
Just slip to your knees
But when the big hand speaks
It's like fireworks and heaven
So you listen
Don't think
And wish for nothing at all
And when the big hand sings
It's like fireworks and friends
Leaving alone I'm not
Leaving alone
Never leaving alone
Leaving alone I'm not
Leaving alone
Leaving alone
I'm not leaving alone again




 This girl has got a smile
That can make me cry
This girl just burns with love
She's burning burning deep outside

Night time night time
Sets my house on fire
I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life
To feel I feel desire

Oh I should feel
Like a polar bear
Like a polar bear
It's impossible

She flies outside this cage
Singing girl-mad words
I keep her dark thoughts deep inside
As black as stone
As mad as birds
Wild wild wild
And never turn away
Sends me all her love
She sends me everything
She sends me everything

Oh I could be
A polar bear
Oh I could be
A polar bear
But it's impossible

I try to talk
The sky goes red
I forget
So fill my head
With some of this
Some of that
Some of every word she said

Night time night time
Sets my house on fire
I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life
To feel I feel desire

Oh I should be
A polar bear
But it's impossible




 This girl has got a smile
That can make me cry
This girl just burns with love
She's burning, burning deep inside
Nighttime, nighttime sets my house on fire
Oh, I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life to feel
I feel desire
Oh, I should feel
Like a polar bear
It's impossible
She flies outside this cage
Singing girlmad words
I keep her dark thoughts deep inside
As black as stone and mad as birds
But wild, wild, wild and never turn away
Oh, sends me all her love
She sends me everything
She sends me everywhere
Oh, I could be
A polar bear
Oh, I could be
A polar bear
It's impossible
I try to talk
The sky goes red
I forget
So fill in my head
With some of this
Some of that
Some of every word she says
Oh, nighttime, nighttime sets my house on fire
Oh, I'll turn into the melting man
I'll lose my life to feel
I feel desire
Oh, I should be
A polar bear
Oh, I should be
A polar bear
But it's impossible




 "This dream never ends", you said
This feel never goes
The time will never come to slip away
"This wave never breaks", you said
This sun never sets again
These flowers will never fade
"This world never stops", you said
This wonder never leaves
The time will never come to say, "Goodbye"
"This tide never turns", you said
This night never falls again
These flowers will never die
Never die, never die
These flowers will never die, never die
"This dream always ends", I said
This feeling always goes
The time always comes to slip away
"This wave always breaks", I said
This sun always sets again
And these flowers will always fade
"This world always stops", I said
This wonder always leaves
The time always comes to say, "Goodbye"
"This tide always turns", I said
This night always falls again
And these flowers will always die
Always die, always die
These flowers will always die
Between you and me it's hard to ever really know
Who to trust? How to think? What to believe?
Between me and you it's hard to ever really know
Who to choose? How to feel? What to do?
Never fade, never die
You give me flowers of love
Always fade, always die
I let fall flowers of blood




 I would say I'm sorry
If I thought that it would change your mind
But I know that this time
I've said too much, been too unkind

I tried to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I tried to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would break down at your feet
And beg forgiveness, plead with you
But I know that it's too late
And now there's nothing I can do

So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away

Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

Now I would do 'most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

Boys don't cry




 Breathe
Breathe on me
Be like you used to be
Breathe on me
Move in me
Be like you used to be
Move in me
Move in me
Be with me
Be like you used to be
With me
With me




 'Don't look, don't look,' the shadows breathe
Whispering me away from you
'Don't wake at night to watch her sleep
You know that you will always lose
This trembling, adored
Tousled birdmad girl'
But every night I burn
Every night I call your name
Every night I burn
Every night I fall again
'Oh, don't talk of love,' the shadows purr
Murmuring me away from you
'Don't talk of worlds that never were
The end is all that's ever true
There's nothing you can ever say
Nothing you can ever do'
Still every night I burn
Every night I scream your name
Every night I burn
Every night the dream's the same
Every night I burn
Waiting for my only friend
Every night I burn
Waiting for the world to end
'Just paint your face,' the shadows smile
Slipping me away from you
'Oh, it doesn't matter how you hide
Find you if we're wanting to
So slide back down and close your eyes
Sleep a while, you must be tired...'
But every night I burn
Every night I call your name
Every night I burn
Every night I fall again
Every night I burn
Scream the animal scream
Every night I burn
Dream the crow black dream
Every night I burn
Scream the animal scream
Every night I burn
Dream the crow black dream
Dream the crow black dream...
Dream the crow black dream...
Dream the crow black dream...
Dream the crow black dream...

 Yes, I know who you remind me of
A girl I think I used to know
Yes, I'd see her when the day got colder
On those days when it felt like snow

You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there

And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling
Again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But I never even caught her name

And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on a floor
And I remember
Even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore

You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sorts of far away
And stay like that for quite a while

And I remember she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling
Again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But never even caught her name
Yes, I sometimes even tried to catch her
But I never even caught her name




 Yeah I know who you remind me of
A girl I think I used to know
Yeah I'd see her when the days got colder
On those days when it felt like snow
You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there
And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But never even caught her name
And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on the floor
And I remember even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore
You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sort of far away
And stay like that for quite a while
And I remember she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But never even caught her name
Yes I sometimes even tried to catch her
But never even caught her name




 Yeah I know who you remind me of
A girl I think I used to know
Yeah I'd see her when the days got colder
On those days when it felt like snow

Yes I sometimes even tried to catch her
But never even caught her name




 Flicka flicka flicka, here you are
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Flowin' and fillin' up my hopeless heart
Oh never, never go
Oh, I dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stop is the day you change
And fly away from me
You flicker and you're beautiful
You glow inside my head
You hold me hypnotized, I'm mesmerized
Your flames are flames that kiss me dead
I'll dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stop is the day you change
And fly away from me
Oh, flicka flicka flicka, here you are
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Flowin' and fillin' up my hopeless heart
Oh never, never go
Oh, I dust my lemon lies
With powder, pink and sweet
The day I stop is the day you change
Fly away, away from me
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl
Cata cata cata, caterpillar girl




 All the faces - All the voices blur
Change to one face - Change to one voice
Prepare yourself for bed...
The light seems bright & glares on white walls
All the sounds of, Charlotte sometimes
Into the night with, Charlotte sometimes
Night after night, she lay alone in bed
Her eyes so open to the dark
The streets all looked so strange
They seemed so far away
But Charlotte did not cry
The people seemed so close
Playing expressionless games
The people seemed so close
So many other names...
Sometimes I'm dreaming
Where all the other people dance
Sometimes I'm dreaming, Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I'm dreaming
Expressionless the trance
Sometimes I'm dreaming
So many different names
Sometimes I'm dreaming
The sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
She hopes to open shadowed eyes
On a different world, come to me
Scared princess - Charlotte sometimes
On that bleak track (See the sun is gone again)
The tears were pouring down her face
She was crying and crying for a girl
Who died so many years before...
Sometimes I dream
Where all the other people dance
Sometimes I dream, Charlotte sometimes
Sometimes I dream
The sounds all stay the same
Sometimes I'm dreaming
There are so many different names
Sometimes I dream... (x2)
Charlotte sometimes, crying for herself
Charlotte sometimes
Dreams a wall around herself
But it's always with love, with so much love
It looks like everything else, of Charlotte -
Sometimes... So far away
Glass sealed and pretty... Charlotte sometimes

 I'm running out of time
I'm out of step and closing down
And never sleep for wanting hours
The empty hours of greed
And uselessly always the need
To feel again the real belief
Of something more than mockery
If only I could fill my heart with love

 I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be
This close to me

Just try to see in the dark
Just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out
Hold my breath
And wait until I shake

But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end

 I ride into your town on a big black trojan horse
I'm looking to have some fun
Some kind of trigger-happy intercourse
"club america salutes you" says the girl on the door
"we accept all major lies
We love any kind of fraud
So go on in and enjoy
Go on in and enjoy!!!
I'm buying for my bright new friends
Blue suzannes all round
And my mood is heavily pregnant
Yeah you're right
I couldn't help but notice your icy blue eyes
They've been burning two holes in the sides of my head
Since the second I arrived

And it's not too hard to guess from your stick-on stars
And your canary feather dress
Your hair in such a carefully careless mess
That you're really trying very hard to impress

You're such a wonderful person living a fabulous life
Sensational dazzling perfectly sized
Such a wonderful person living a fabulous life
Sharing it with me in club america tonight...

So we talk for a while about some band you saw on tv
But I don't listen to you and you don't listen to me
Yeah it's an old routine but it's a very special part of the game
And you don't really care what I call you at all
When I can't quite remember your name



Yeah you're a wonderful person living a fabulous life
Fantastic divine and thrillingly bright
Such a wonderful person living a fabulous lie
With me in club america tonight




 Scarred
Your back was turned
Curled like an embryo
Take another face
You will be kissed again
I was cold as l mouthed the words
And crawled across the mirror
I wait, await the next breath
Your name like ice into my heart
A shallow grave
A monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes
And eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon
Another past time
Your name like ice into my heart
Everything as cold as life
Can no one save you?
Everything as cold as silence
And you never say a word

Your name like ice into my heart
Your name like ice into my heart




 We are currently missing these lyrics




 Scarred, your back was turned, curled like an embryo
Take another face, you will be kissed again
I was cold as I mouthed the words, and crawled across the mirror
I wait, await the next breath
Your name like ice into my heart
A shallow grave, a monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes, and eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon, another pastime
Your name like ice into my heart
Everything as cold as life, can no one save you?
Everything, as cold as silence
And you never say a word
Your name like ice into my heart
Your name like ice into my heart




 Yeah, it's a snow white original mix
And she's fixing me
And the heartless thing she does is everything I love
It's all I ever need
Yeah, it's a skin tight sensational strip
And she's tripping me
And the shameless way she turns
Is all I ever dream
You ask me why I use it
It could be just a way to pass the time
I never really choose it
It's just another play to lose
My mind
Yeah, it's a bright light promotional taste
And she's wasting me
And the tearless time she breaks is everytime I ache
It's all I ever feel
You ask me why I need it
It's maybe just a way to pass the time
I never really mean it
It's just another play to lose
My mind
Yeah, it's a big night emotional kill
And she's thrilling me
And the careless way she hurts
Is all I ever scream
You ask me why I take it
It could be just a way to pass the time
I never really make it
It's just another play to lose
I'm coming up in the dark
And every part of me is bruised, and raw, and pained
I'm coming up in the dark
And every part of me is loose, and sore, and stained
And so I play it when I use it
If I need it, then I take it and I play it all again
And then I hold you
So cold you
Like I know you
Yeah, like I always know and like I always lose
My mind
My mind
Yeah, I play it when I use it
If I need it, then I take it and I play it all again
And then I hold you
So cold you
Like I know you
Like I always know, like I always lose
Like I always lose
Like I always lose
My mind




 If only you'd never speak to me
The way that you do
If only you'd never speak like that
It's like listening to
A breaking heart, falling sky
Fire go out and friendship die
I wish you felt the way that I still do
The way that I still do
If only you'd never look at me
The way that you do
If only you'd never look like that
When I look at you
I see face like stone, eyes of ice
Mouth so sweetly telling lies
I wish you felt the way that I still do
The way that I still do

But you don't
You don't feel anymore
You don't care anymore
It's all gone, it's all gone, it's all gone

If only you'd never pull from me
The way that you do
If only you'd never pull like that
When I'm with you
I feel hopeless hands helplessly
Pulling you back close to me
I wish you felt the way that I still do
The way that I still do


If only you'd ever speak to me
The way you once did
Look at me the way you once did
Pull to me the way you once did




 So we meet again! And I offer my hand
All dry and English slow
And you look at me and I understand
Yeah it's a look I used to know
Three long years and your favorite man
Is that any way to say hello?
And you hold me like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me
Oh, come on and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while
Oh, I wish I could and I will!
But now I just don't have the time
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look goodbye
I still see that look in your eye
So dizzy Mr. Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
Until later doesn't always come
Until later doesn't always come
It's so hard to think it ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
To hold you, to hold you
But chilly Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time
Won't be long until later
I should've stopped to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over and you're gone
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you so much
But how many times can I walk away and wish, if only
How many times can I talk this way and wish, if only
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish if only but if only is a wish too late




 So we meet again and I offer my hand
All dry and English slow
And you look at me and I understand, yeah it's the look I used to know
"Three long years and your favourite man
Is that any way to say hello?"
And you hold me
Like you'll never let me go
Like you'll never let me go
"Oh come on and have a drink with me
Sit down and talk a while"
"Oh I wish I could and I will!
But now I just don't have the time"
And over my shoulder as I walk away
I see you give that look goodbye
I still see that look in your eyes
So dizzy, Mr. Busy, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the silly frilly things have to first get done
In a minute, sometime soon, maybe next time, make it June
Until later doesn't always come
Until later doesn't always come
It's so hard to think it ends sometime
And this could be the last
I should really hear you sing again
And I should really watch you dance
Because it's hard to think I'll never get another chance
To hold you
To hold you
But chilly, Mr. Dilly, too much rush to talk to Billy
All the tizzy, fizzy idiot things must get done
In a second, just hang on, all in good time, won't be long
Until later
I should've stop to think, I should've made the time
I could've had that drink, I could've talked a while
I would've done it right, I would've moved us on
But I didn't, now it's all too late
It's over and you're gone
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you so much
But how many times can I walk away
And wish "if only"
How many times can I talk this way
And wish "if only"
Keep on making the same mistake
Keep on aching the same heartbreak
I wish "if only"
But "if only"
Is a wish too late

 Hey mister a review
A word for salad
Is written by my friend
Ian Penman
He uses long words
Like semiotics and semolina
But I countered
With enigma
And metropolis
The lads go rampant
On insignificant symbolism
And compound this with
Rude soulless obliqueness
Everything's coming to a grinding halt
I use such long words
It's all clever stuff
All this charming childish
Fiddling about
Aims for the anti-image
But it naturally creates
The perfectly malleable image
The tantalizing enigma
Of The Cure
They try to take
Everything
But The Cure really
They're just trying to sell us something
Their product is more artificial than most
This is perhaps part of their
Masterplan
But it seems more like their naivety
Everything's coming to a grinding halt
Everything's coming to a grinding halt
Everything's coming to a grinding halt
Note how really songs are made of
Murk and marshes
Tawdry images
Inane realisations
Dull dull dull epigrams
Sometimes they sound like an
Avant-garde John Otway
Or an ugly spirit
Toy drumming
Sprightly bass
Primitive guitar riff
Shep the Sheepdog is my favorite book
People don't forget the Penman
It's just that in 1979
People shouldn't be allowed
To get away with things like this
I say




 Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over
And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again
But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is
Always is




 Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit, it starts the need
To just let go, my party piece
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for younger meat
And the sound it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit, it starts the need
To just let go, my party piece
I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness, murmured in dreams
And we both of us knew how the ending would be
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in deep, to the heart of bone again
Round and round and round
It's coming apart again
Over and over and over
Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
Crying for sympathy
Crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd and three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me
To get closer to Heaven than ever feel whole again
I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness, murmured in dreams
And we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always
Always

 Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit, it starts the need
To just let go, my party piece
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for younger meat
And the sound it makes when it cuts in deep

 It's a perfect day for letting go
For setting fire to bridges
Boats
And other dreary worlds you know
Let's get happy
It's a perfect day for making out
To wake up with a smile without a doubt
To burst grin, giggle, bliss, skip, jump, sing and shout
Let's get happy

"But it's much too late" you say
"For doing this now, we should have done it then"
Well it just goes to show how wrong you can be
And how you really should know
That it's never too late to get up and go

It's a perfect day for kiss and swell
Rip zipping, button popping, kiss and well
There's loads of other stuff can make you yell
Let's get happy
It's a perfect day for doing the unstuck
For dancing like you can't hear the beat
And you don't give a further thought to things like feet
Let's get happy


Kick out the gloom, kick out the blues
Tear out the pages with all the bad news
Pull down the mirrors and pull down the walls
Tear up the stairs and tear up the floors

Oh, just burn down the house, burn down the street
Turn everything red and the beat is complete
With the sound of your world going up in the fire
It's a perfect day to throw back your head, kiss it all goodbye

It's a perfect day for getting wild
Forgetting all your worries
Life and everything that makes you cry
Let's get happy
It's a perfect day for dreams come true
For thinking big
And doing anything you want to do
Let's get happy

Oh yeah!
Platinum all the way!
Do the Hansa!




 Stop my flight to fight
And die
And take a stand to change my life
So savage with red desperation
I clench my hands
You draw your claws
A hidden rage consumes my heart
Fueled by years of wasted time
I close my eyes
And tense myself
And screaming
Throw myself in fury over the edge
And into your blood

Tear at flesh
And rip at skin
And smash at doubt
I have to break you
Fury drives my vicious blows
I see you fall but still i strike you

Again and again
Your body falls
The movement is sharp and clear and pure
And gone
I stop and kneel beside you
Drained of everything but pain

Screaming throw myself in fury
Over the edge and into your blood
Kiss you once and see you writhe
Hold you close and hear you cry
Kiss your eyes and finish your life
Kiss your eyes
Finish your life

Again and again
Your body falls
The movement is sharp and clear and pure
And gone
I stop and kneel beside you
Knowing i'll murder you again tonight

Knowing i'll murder you again
Tonight

 Around the sea-green pool we spin
Mermaids sing songs to pull us in
Just when we're here, she slides up slow
To fallllllll down under
Her burning eyes, the only clue to
Who plays, what plays, when plays
You just blew my cue to drown this there
All in wonder
Oh I can't start, I smiled at her twice
Helpless bids
And minds as blank with ice
Disguise the stroke, entice you out
To quote a number
Breathe in and breathe in
As long as you choose
Remember not all games are won
By the last one to lose
Remember...
Tear until his head we break and
Trick is how to fake the first mistake
To rip and take, the easy choice
Too close to care how
Whispered songs and changing stride
Day to night, and every wrong is right
Come dry your eye, bite my lip
We're almost there now
Breathe in and breathe in
As long as you choose
Remember not all games are won

 Going under slowly
It never seems too late
Going under so slow

Dressing up to kiss
Dressing up to touch all this
I'm dressing up to dance all week
I'm dressing up to sleep
Dressing up to kiss
Dressing up to be all this
I could eat your face
I could eat all of you
Oh this night will never let me go


You'll pick me up again




 Going under slowly
Oh, it never seems too late
Going under
So slow
Dressing up to kiss
Dressing up to touch all this
Dressing up, dressing up
Oh, I'm dressing up to dance all week, oh
Dressing up, dressing up
Oh, I'm dressing up to sleep
Dressing up to kiss
Dressing up to be all this
Oh, I could eat your face
I could eat all of you
Dressing up, dressing up
Dressing up, dressing up
Oh, this night will never let me go
Dressing up, dressing up
Dressing up, dressing up
This night will never let me go
Going under slowly
Never seems too late
Going under slowly
You'll pick me up again




 On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west LA
Or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

Oh but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh I was overwhelmed and frankly scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Either way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by

On the upside of a downward spiral
My love for you went viral
And I loved you every mile you drove away
But now here you are again
So let's skip the "how you been"
And get down to the "more than friends" at last



Please believe that when I leave
There's nothing up my sleeve but love for you
And a little time to get my head together too

On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause

Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me everything is groovy
They don't like it sue me
Either way you do me
Oh I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by




 I think I've reached that point
Where giving up and going on
Are both the same dead end to me
Are both the same old song
I think I've reached that point
Every wish has come true
Tired, disguised oblivion
Everything I do

Please stop loving me
I am none of these things

I think I've reached that point
Where all the things you have to say
Hopes of something more from me
Just games to pass the time away


I think I've reached that point
Where every word that you write
Of every blood dark sea
And every soul black night

And every dream you dream me in
And every perfect free from sin
And burning eyes and hearts on fire
Just the same old song




 Instrumental




 (Haven't got any words)
The barber chair falls to the floor
He rolls in tears
But he cries no more
Someone feels stand through his eyes
And he moves his arm against the light
Tips his hair
Swallows his dreams
The silence drowns his final screams
I said it to the naked child
I'm alone with her
Faded smiles
Tips his hair
Swallows his dreams
The silence drowns his final screams
I said it to the naked child
I'm alone with her
Faded smiles




 Catch me if i fall
I'm losing hold
I can't just carry on this way
And every time
I turn away
Lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me
Suddenly i see you change
Everything at once
The same
But the mountain never moves
Rape me like a child
Christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope
Your voice is dead
And old
And always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please
Say the right words
Or cry like the stone white clown
And stand forever
Lost forever in a happy crowd

No one lifts their hands
No one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better

I went away alone
With nothing left
But faith

 I can't fly I never really could
I don't feel you ever really understood at all
I can't fly I never really could
I just throw my arms out as I fall
Always say you know me, you - you don't know me at all
Only want to hold me, but I'm not here to hold
Always say you know me, but you don't know me at all
Only want to show me, but I'm not yours to show, no no no
I don't dream I never really did
Don't believe you ever really took this into good
No I don't dream I never really did
I just wake up, make up as I should
No I don't dream
No I don't dream
No I don't dream
I won't see I never really would
I don't sense you ever realised it right
No I won't see I never really would
I just roll my eyes up out of sight
Always say you know me, you - you don't know me at all
Only want to hold me, but I'm not here to hold
Always say you know me, but you don't know me at all
Only want to show me, but I'm not yours to show
I can't ever come back, if I never go
I don't ever explain, if I never know
I won't ever take it, if I never give
And if I never live, if I never live, if I never live




 Oh, it's opening time down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling and I'm begging
To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in
Yeah, I like you in that like
I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth
Then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair
Just pull on your pout
And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under
Slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face
Just pull on your feet

Pull on your pout

So pull on your hair, pull on your pout
Cut the conversation, just open your mouth
Pull on your face, pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
On Fascination Street




 Oh, it's opening time down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling and I'm begging
To drag you down with me, to kick the last nail in
Yeah, I like you in that, like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout
And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street
So pull on your hair, pull on your pout
Cut the conversation, just open your mouth
Pull on your face, pull on your feet

 Like a feeling that I'm down
Down inside my heart
Like I'm looking out through splitting blood red windows in my heart
From a higher up than heaven
And a harder down than stone
Shake the fear that always clawing
Pulls me clawing down alone
As I spitting splitting blood red
Breaking windows in my heart
And the past is taunting
Fear of ghosts is forcing me apart

And the further I get
From the things that I care about
The less I care about
How much further away I get
And the further I get
From the things that I care about
The less I care about
How much further away I get...
I am lost again
With everything gone
And more alone than I have ever been
I expect you to understand
To feel it too
But I know that even if you will
You cannot ever help me
Nor can I ever help you




 Like a feeling that I'm down
Deep inside my heart
Like I'm looking out through
Splitting blood red
Windows in my heart
From a higher up than heaven
And a harder down than stone
Shake the fear that always clawing
Pulls me clawing down alone
As I spitting splitting blood red
Breaking windows in my heart
And the past is taunting
Fear of ghosts
Is forcing me apart
And the further I get
From the things that I care about
The less I care about
How much further away I get...
I am lost again
With everything gone
And more alone
Than I have ever been
I expect you to understand
To feel it too
But I know that even if you will
You cannot ever help me
Nor can I
Ever help you




 The look before I go is the look for you
You only have to look and it will all come true
And we can fall outside
Into the fizzy night
Or pull me down in here, you know it's all the same
I only want to see if you are happy again
Or we can roll around
And find out upside down, oh
A few hours after this and we're apart again
Like two white checks, like opposite poles
In a secret game
Like nothing like these I suppose
I really should have known by the cut of your smile
That the answer would be simple
It still took you a while to get it out of me
I thought you'd do it easily
Just put your hands around my heart and squeeze me 'til I'm dry
I never thought you'd ever start to ever ask me why
Just put your hands around my heart and squeeze me 'til I'm dry
I never thought you'd ever start to ever ask me why
I never saw you again
I never saw you again
I never saw you again
I never saw you again




 Sometimes, there's nothing to feel
Sometimes, there's nothing to hold
Sometimes, there's no time to run away
Sometimes, you just feel so old
The times it hurts when you cry
The times it hurts just to breathe
And then it all seems like there's no-one left
And all you want is to sleep

Fight, fight, fight
Just push it away
Fight, fight, fight
Just push until it breaks
Fight, fight, fight
Don't cry at the pain
Fight, fight, fight
Or watch yourself burn again
Fight, fight, fight
Don't howl like a dog
Fight, fight
Just fill up the sky
Fight, fight, fight
Fight until you drop
Fight, fight, fight
And never, never
Never stop

Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight
Fight, fight, fight

So when the hurting starts
And when the nightmares begin
Remember you can fill up the sky
You don't have to give in
You don't have to give in

Never give in
Never give in
Never give in

 Slowly fading blue, the eastern hollows
Catch the dying sun, night-time follows
Silence and black mirror pool
Mirrors The lonely place Where i meet you

See your head In the fading light
And through the dark Your eyes shine bright
And burn Like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo

Shifting crimson veil, silken hips
Slide under my hand swollen lips
Whisper my name and i yearn
You take me in your arms, and start to burn
F-i-r-e-i-n-c-a-i-r-o
F-i-r-e-i-n-c-a-i-r-o
F-i-r-e-i-n-c-a-i-r-o

Burn like a fire in Cairo

Burn like a fire fire fire fire
Blaze like a fire in Cairo
Blaze like a fire fire fire fire, flare
Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo

We burn like fire

Swollen lips
Whisper my name

Burn like a fire, fire, fire
Blaze like a fire in Cairo

 Pulling this watch as faces go
Pulling in a word and done it slow this other time
I see your face is silent
Oh, we go away and play
What have you done
Takes a feeling inside us all
Continue out with just one push in my mouth
But you're so close now
And you're so close now
All I have to do is three short blows
All that still is best inside
The full when the wall
And you don't even know
All I Have to Do is Kill Her 
And the other faces here with me
The others dressed in summers thing
If only one way is to be wonderful
If only one way is to the other song
And every time it's you, it's like the blood on the stairs is sent away
And every time we see it's all said before you
If only one way is to kill you
You used to say this fear of drowning
Fear no death by water
Father walks in at the foot of the bed
Six of you want to see you safe
Just one time you'll meet this man
All you've got to do is kill her
And all you've got to do is kill her
Trickle the sands against and pull the animals
Just out of the womb
Seeing the cow dead before he was born
It's the man he, he loved
The solid pieces fell on the ground
He couldn't kill another life 
It's all been painted with love
It could have been some friends
Pulling strings to meet you
All I want to do is reach it
She says "Let go my shoulder!"
See the sky!
And the sky goes black
And the sky goes black
I just want to feel her
I just want to feel her
I just want you to feel it
I just want you to feel it
Everytime I looked up the stairs
I used to see her die
She would move so slow
Anyone could've been but she was a cat
Anyone could've been she was a cat
Pulling away as I used to fight
That's just playing so low
That ugly or pretty
The face stays the same
Her face stays the same
Her face stays the same
The ugly or pretty
Her face stays the same, stays the same, stays the same
And looking on the final walls
And looking on the final walls
Did you now find this malice out
The angels fall
Let's make some noise 
Make some noise
Let's make some noise
Let's make some noise
Make some noise
Help me be your mother for just one day
Let's fall in churches far outside
They used to love
They used to love
They used to
They used to love

 You know you're a cute little heartbreaker
You know you're a sweet little lovemaker
I want to take you home
I won't do you no harm
You've got to be all mine
All mine
I see you come down on the scene, Foxy
You make me want to get up and scream, Foxy
I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting
Tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine
All mine
I've made up my mind
I'm tired of wasting all my precious time
You've got to be all mine
All mine




 I can't believe it, I must be dreaming
She turns the sound down
Says, "I am heaving
This is a freakshow"

And I am screaming
She spins the world round
I want to stop
Bittersweet again
Her opening move
Down and out in black
Soft shiny and smooth
Looks like the alien
Crowd got groove
She burns her name into my arm
But I can never get through
To play the game
She's trying to lose
Her ultraviolet makes it
Harder to choose

Looks like the edge
Of the earth got moved
She blurs a way across the floor
I spin to swallow the view
And it's the same sway
Yeah, it's the same slide
It's the same stare, oh
It's the same smile
Yeah, it's the same but
It's not quite right
Oh, it's insane
She shakes like a freak
Stuck in the middle
Of the room for a week

Looks like the only way
To get on the beat
Is take her up on how to swing
But I am missing my feet
And it's the same sway
Yeah, it's the same slide
It's the same stare, oh
It's the same smile
Yeah, it's the same but
It's not quite right
I'm in a step, out
She two more steps down
For three steps up, clap
And go around, ow

It makes my head buzz
She wants to come now
I try to stop
Always infra dig her
Finishing move
Up and down in black
Soft shiny and smooth
Looks like the alien
Crowd got groove
She cuts a number out my arm
But I can never get through
To play this game
She's trying to lose
The stuff from Mars
Makes it harder to choose

Looks like the final frontier got moved
She blurs a way across the floor
I spin to swallow the view
And it's the same sway
Yeah, it's the same slide
It's the same strip, oh
It's the same smile
Yeah, it's the same
But it's not quite right
I can't believe it, I must be dreaming
She turns the lights up
Says she is leaving
This is a freakshow

And I am beaten
She spins the world round

You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday I'm in love
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love




 Every time we do this, I fall for her
Wave after wave after wave, it's all for her
"I know this can't be wrong", I say
(And I'll lie to keep her happy)
As long as I know that you know
That today I belong right here with you
Right here with you
And so we watch the sun come up
From the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire
Like she wants to believe in me
So I try put your hands in the sky
Surrender, remember
We'll be here forever
And we'll never say goodbye
I've never been so colorfully
See through head before
I've never been so
Wonderfully me you want some more
And all I want is to keep it like this
You and me alone, a secret kiss
And don't go home, don't go away
Don't let this end, please stay
Not just for today
"Never, never, never, never, never let me go", she says
"Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days"
But suddenly she slows and looks down at my breaking face
"Why do you cry? What did I say?"
"But it's just rain", I smile brushing my tears away

I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried over you

How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry? Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something we will always want
"Why, why, why are you letting me go?" she says
"I feel you pulling back, I feel you changing shape"
And just as I'm breaking free, she hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky, surrenders it all


It's always the same, wake up in the rain
Head in pain, hung in shame
A different name, same old game, love in vain
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Away from home again




 Get away from me
Get your fingers out of my face
This room's so hot
I break the walls
Get away from me
Leave me alone
Like the pig on the stairs
Hanging
In a groovy purple shirt
Gasping for air
I'm gasping for air
I'm gasping for love
I'm gasping for air
Slit the cats like cheese
Then eat the sweet sticky things
Suck harder suck harder
Suck your insides insides out
Blood thick swimming round your feet
As you're choking
Choking
Choking on the fleshy words
Give me it give me it give me it
Deaden my glassy mind
Give me it give me it give me it
Make me blind
One step back and one step down
And slip the needles in my side
My head is cold
My hands are cold
My heart is cold
My heart is black
And stops every fucking night
Every night
I wait until it stops

Sing birds sing birds sing birds sing
Get away




 Get away from me
Get your fingers out of my face
This room's so hot
This room's so hot
Get away from me
Leave me alone
Like the pig on the stairs
I'm hanging in a groovy purple shirt
Gasping for air
Gasping for air
I'm gasping for love
I'm gasping for air
Slit the cats like cheese
Then eat the sweet sticky things
Suck harder, suck harder
Suck your insides, insides out
Blood thick swimming 'round your feet
As you're choking, choking
Choking on 
Give me it, give me it, give me it
Deaden my glassy mind
Give me it, give me it, make me blind
One step back and one step down
Slip the needles in my side
My head is cold
My heart is cold
My heart is black
Heart is black
Stops every fucking night
Every night, I wait until it stops
Sing birds, sing birds, sing birds, sing
Get away, get away, get away, get away




 Get away from me
Get your fingers out of my face
This room's so hot
This room's so hot
I break the walls
Get away from me
Leave me alone
Oh, like the pig on the stairs
Hanging in a groovy purple shirt
Gasping for air
I'm gasping for air
I'm gasping for love
I'm gasping for air
Slit the cats like cheese
Then eat the sweet sticky things
Suck harder, suck harder
Suck your insides, insides out
Blood thick swimming round your feet
As you're choking, choking
Choking on the fleshy words
Give me it, give me it
Give me it, deaden my glassy mind
Give me it, give me it
Make me blind
One step back and one step down
And slip the needles in my side
My head is cold
My hands are cold
My heart is cold
My heart is black
And stops every fucking night
Every night I wait until it stops
Sing, birds, sing, birds
Sing, birds, sing
Get away
Get away
Get away
Get away
Give me it, give me it
Give me it, give me it
Give me it, give me it
Give me it, give me it




 I'm going nowhere
Don't look so scared
I'm going nowhere
Don't look
So tell me that you love me again
Tell me that you care
So tell me that you love me again
Yeah, I'm going nowhere
Don't look so scared
I'm going nowhere
Could be
Could be
Could be
I'm already there




 Oh you know how it is
Wake up feeling blue
And everything that could be wrong is
Including you
Black clouds and rain and pain in your head
And all you want to do is stay in bed

But if you do that you'll be missing the world
Because it doesn't stop turning whatever you heard
If you do that you'll be missing the world
You have to get up get out and get gone!

Yeah you know how it is
Wake up feeling green
Sick as a dog and six times as mean
You don't want to sing you don't want to play
You don't want to swing you don't want to sway
All you want to do is nothing
On a day like today

You have to get up get out and get gone!
Yeah get up get out and get it on
Get up get out and get gone!
You have to get up get out and get living
Yeah this is really it

Nothing much to think and nothing much to say
Don't want to talk don't want to try
Don't want to think don't want to know
Who what where when or why

 I never felt like this with anyone before
You only have to smile and I'm dizzy
You make the world go round a thousand times an hour
Just touch my head and send me spinning
I never felt like this with anyone before
You show me colours and I'm crying
You hold my eyes in yours and open up the world
I can't believe all this, I can't believe all this
I want to keep this feeling deep inside of me
I want you always in my heart
You are everything
You are everything
I never felt like this with anyone before
You fill my head all full of rainbows
And all the rainbows end as every step you take
Just to be with you forever
I want to keep this feeling deep inside of me
I want you always in my heart
You are everything
You are everything




 Simon is twenty in half an hour
So this is for him:
Those down days
When you felt so young
And everything seemed
You saw the people
Around you
Getting old
You wake up
The teenage yearn is
Gone for you
It happens to others
It happens all the time
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
The candles on the cake
Waiting to be blown
Wish I was
An other...
Please give me
An other...

 I'll never understand
(Come closer and I'll whisper)
Who was that standing in the rain?
If only I could
If only I could remember
Oh, what he said...
(And how it all began)
Happy the man
With the face that smiles!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-happy the man
With the face that smiles!
But it has to have a name
(Something strong
Something faithful
Something pure... )
Oh, how does he look so safe?
He'll never
He'll never turn away
Ha-ha-happy the man
He'll never turn away
Happy the man...

 Nothing ever gets in my way
Nothing ever gets on my mind
Nothing ever makes me stop to think about
Nothing of the kind
Nothing ever loses me sleep
Nothing ever wins my heart
Nothing ever makes me want to sing along
And nothing makes me want to start
If I'm falling down a mountain
Then I pick myself up
If I crash into an iceberg
I don't give a frightful look around..
If I am burning then I put myself out
I'm so completely full
I scare the world
Oh all the world
All inside out
Just look around...
Nothing ever puts me out
Nothing ever pulls me in
Nothing ever makes me want to jump
And nothing makes me want to begin
Nothing ever gets me down
Nothing ever gets me uptight
And nothing ever makes me run around
And nothing makes me feel I might
If I'm hanging from a peach tree
Then I cut myself down
And if I look into the sun
I just turn up the sound
And if I swallow deathcap loverooms
Then I spit them right out
I'm so completely full
I scare the world
Yeah all the world
Inside out
Nothing ever gets in my way
Nothing ever gets on my mind
Nothing ever makes me stop to think about
Nothing of the kind
Harold and Joe
Go go go!!!
Yeah...

 Spit out the shout of a warning
Death is an honour with doubts
So you live in the end
And you mistrust the start
Because you don't think it counts
But you'll pay for yourself
You'll pay for yourself
You're just a heroin face
You see a heroin face in the mirror
And someone is clutching your breath
And you believe in the needle of night
You're only doing your best
But you'll pay for yourself
You'll pay for yourself
You believe in the needle of night
And someone is clutching your breath
So you mistrust the start
By always running away
But you'll never come back
You're just a heroin face
Heroin face

 When I see you sky as a kite
As high as I might I can't get that high
The how, you move, the way, you burst the clouds
It makes me want to try
When I see you sticky as lips
As licky as trips I can't lick that far
But when you paw, the way you shout out loud
It makes me want to start
And when I see you happy as a girl
That swims in a world of magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through
To think I could've let you go

And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take
I say, "I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away"

And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah as smitten as that I can't get that small
The way you fur, the how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all
And when I see you happy as a girl
That lives in a world of make believe
It makes me pull my hair all out
To think I could've let you leave

And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take
I say, "I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you go"

 Every time I try to tell you how I feel inside
I always make the same mistake
Tie myself in knots
Sometimes even make you cry
When all I ever want to say
Is "Nobody else in the whole wide world
Makes me feel this way...
Nobody else in the whole wide world
Takes my breath away"
Makes me feel so strange inside
Dazed, confused and starry-eyed
I couldn't love you more
Makes me feel the wrong way round
Inside out and upside down
I couldn't love you more
And every time I try to tell you what I really mean
Nothing seems to come out right
And I end up murmuring foolishly it makes me want to scream
How I get so stupefied
There's nobody else in the whole wide world
Makes me feel this way
There's nobody else in the whole wide world
Takes my breath away
Makes me feel so strange inside
Open-mouthed and mystified
I couldn't love you more
Makes me feel so upside down
Muddle-headed round and round
I couldn't love you more
Makes me feel so strange inside
Dazed, confused and starry-eyed
I couldn't love you more
Makes me feel the wrong way round
Inside out and upside down
Oh I couldn't love you more




 Hey hey!
Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
And I forget how to move
When my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts
In a blood-stained sky
Oh it was sweet
It was wild
And oh how we...
I trembled
Stuck in honey
Honey
Cling to me...
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
Oh just one more
And I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home




 Hey, hey
Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win

And I forget how to move
When my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts
In a blood-stained sky
Ah, it was sweet
It was wild
And oh, how we
I trembled
Stuck in honey
Honey, cling to me
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
Ah, just one more
And I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
To never go home

 The first time I saw lightning strike
I saw it underground
Six deep feet below the street
The sky came crashing down
For a second, that place was lost in space
Then everything went black
I left that basement burning
And I never went back
The second time I saw it strike
I saw it at sea
It lit up the fish like rain
And rained them down on me
For a second, that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater
And I never went back

Hey, hey, hey!
But I like it when that lightning comes
Hey, hey, hey!
Yes, I like it a lot
Hey, hey, hey!
Yes, I'm jumping like a jumping jack
Dancing, screaming, itching, squealing, fevered
Feeling hot, hot, hot!

The third time I saw lightning strike
It hit me in bed
It threw me around
And left me for dead
For a second, that room was on the moon
Then everything went black
I left that house on fire
And I never went back




 The first time I saw lightning strike
I saw it underground
Six deep feet below the street
The sky came crashing down
For a second that place was lost in space
Then everything went black
I left that basement burning
And I never went back
The second time I saw it strike
I saw it at sea
It lit up all the fish like rain
And rained them down on me
For a second that boat was still afloat
Then everything went black
I left it underwater
And I never went back
Hey hey hey!!!
But I like it when that lightning comes
Hey hey hey!!!
Yes I like it a lot
Hey hey hey!!!
Yes I'm jumping like a jumping jack
Dancing screaming itching squealing fevered
Feeling hot hot hot!!!
The third time I saw lightning strike

Hey hey hey!!!

 You want to know why I hate you?
Well, I'll try and explain
You remember that day in Paris
When we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other
That we'd always think the same
And dreamed that dream
To be two souls as one
And stopped just as the sun set
And waited for the night
Outside a glittering building
Of glittering glass and burning light
And in the road before us
Stood a weary greyish man
Who held a child upon his back
A small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags
And thinner than the air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you

The father's eyes said "Beautiful! How beautiful you are!"
The boy's eyes said
"How beautiful! She shimmers like a star!"
The child's eyes uttered nothing
But a mute and utter joy
And filled my heart with shame for us
At the way we are

I turned to look at you
To read my thoughts upon your face
And gazed so deep into your eyes
So beautiful and strange
Until you spoke
And showed me understanding is a dream
"I hate these people staring
Make them go away from me!"


And this is why I hate you
And how I understand
That no-one ever knows or loves another




 You want to know why I hate you
Well I'll try and explain
Remember that day in paris
When we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other
That we'll always think the same
And dreamed that dream to be two souls as one
And stopped just as the sun set
And waited for the night
Aside a gliterring building
Of glittering glass and burning light
And in the road before us
Stood a weary grayish man
He held a child upon his back
A small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags
And thinner than air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you
The father's eyes said "Beautiful! How beautiful you are!"
The boy's eyes said "How beautiful! She shimmers like a star!"
The child's eyes eyes said nothing

And gazed so deeply into your eyes
So beautiful and strange
Till you spoke and showed me understanding is a dream
"I hate these people staring
Make them go away from here"
The father's eyes said "Beautiful! How beautiful you are!"
The boy's eyes said "How beautiful! She glitters like a star!"
The child's eyes eyes said nothing
But a quiet and utter joy
And filled my heart with sadness
For the way we are
And this is why I hate you
And how I understand
That no one ever knows or loves another
Or loves another




 Your delicious, dreaming, slack jawed, green-eyed
Rub my nose in icing sugar, smooth as
When this cold and deadly blade kisses the fruit
So soft and gently breathing under your skin

Oh, I'll empty you, I'll empty you
As empty as a boy can be
As empty as a boy can be




 You're delicious
Dreaming
Slack jawed
Green eyed
Rub my nose in icing sugar
Smooth as
When this cold and deadly blade
Kisses the fruit
So soft and gently breathing
Under your skin
Oh I'll empty you
I'll empty you
As empty as a boy can be
As empty as a boy can be

 I don't know what's going on
I am so up close to you
I don't know what's going on
I am so confused by you
I don't know what's going on

Don't say anymore
To me at all

I am so in love with you
With you, with you
I am so in love with you
With you, with you
I don't know what's going on
I am so in deep with you
I don't know what's going on
I am so disturbed by you
I don't know what's going on


I am so in love with you




 If only tonight we could sleep
In a bed made of flowers
If only tonight we could fall
In a deathless spell
If only tonight we could slide
Into deep, black water
And breathe
Then an angel would come
With burning eyes like stars
And bury us deep
In his velvet arms
And the rain would cry
As our faces slipped away
And the rain would cry

Don't let it end

 You're begging me to stay
But I'm laughing in your face
You're so desperate
Not to let those years of care
All go to waste
But it was you who wanted love
Not romance
You have to pay the price
My body may be made of fire
But my soul is made of ice
I'm me
I'm cold
I'm cold
I'm told
I'd love to love you girl
But my body has just been sold

 Yesterday I got so old
I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old
It made me want to cry
Go on, go on
Just walk away
Your choice is made
Go on, go on
And disappear
Go on, go on
Away from here

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
Inbetween without you
Without you

Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
Come back come back
Don't walk away
Come back, come back
Come back today
Come back, come back
Why can't you see
Come back, come back
Come back to me

And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me
And be her in between
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you

 I play at night in your house
I live another life
Pretending to swim in your house
I change the time in your house
The hours I take go so slow
I hear no sound in your house
Silence in the empty rooms
I drown at night in your house
Pretending to swim
Pretending to swim

Pretending to swim

I drown at night in your house
Pretending to swim
Pretending to swim

 You wear your smile
Like it was going out of fashion
Dress to inflame
But douse any ideas of passion
You carry your love in a trinket
Hanging round your throat
Always inviting
Always exciting
But I must not take off my coat

Well I'm tired of hanging around
I want somebody new
I'm not sure who I've got in mind
But I know
That it's not you 

You ask me questions
That I never wanted to hear
I am the only one
Just until you finish this year
I would murder you
If I had the alibi
Here in my hand
And you just laugh
Cause you don't understand

That I'm tired of hanging around
I want somebody new
I'm not sure
Who I've got in mind
But I know that it's not you
It's not you 

No it's not you
That it's not you
It's not you 




 You wear your smile

Because you don't understand

I'm not sure who I've got in mind

 I get up
And it's over
It's always over
It's raining and I'm burned
And it's late and you're gone
And I can barely remember
Anything I did or said
Or how I lost another week
There must be something going on
A nagging sense of shame
I can't explain
An acrid taste of smoke and blood
And tears and drugs
And every inch of me is raw
And it's always fucking over
It's raining and I'm blind
And it's late and you're gone
I can't do this anymore

Keep getting there
It's over
It's always over
It's raining and I'm cracked
And it's late and you're out
And I can't quite remember
Anything I did or said
Or how I lost another year
There must be something coming down
A sweetly sour unease
It's like a tease
A broken dream of guilt and fear
And spit and steel
And every piece of me in pain
And it's always fucking over
It's raining and I'm cold
And it's late and you're out again

Run my head around it
Like I know I really miss her
But I always want to do it now
She told me in a whisper
I try so hard to place it
Wonder why I really feel it
When to send the pretty flowers
Maybe helps her to believe it
Run my tongue along it
Oh the taste is something sicker
"But you know you have to do it now
She told me in a whisper
It only takes a second
But the second lasts forever
Close your eyes
And let me take you down

And I get up
And it's over
It's always fucking over
It's raining and I'm wrecked
And it's late and you're
No I can't remember
Anything I did or said
Or how I lost another life
I lost another life
Oh I can't do this anymore

No
I can't do this anymore




 All he needs is everyone I've been
And all she needs is everywhere I've seen
All they need
Anything I've touched
And all you need is everything I've loved
Everything I've heard everything I've learned
Everything I've tried everything I've held
Everything I've felt everything I've lost
Everything I've cried
Until my whole head shrieks with grinding my teeth
Struggling to find a single word I can keep
Any kind of truth
Any kind of hope
Oh just any kind of word that doesn't make me choke
But I keep saying I will and I won't
I keep saying I do and I don't
I keep saying I feel
But there is nothing to feel
Just a strange kind of nothing where it used to be me...
It used to be me
All he needs from me is everyone I've ever missed
And all she needs from me
Everyone I've ever kissed
All they need from me
Anything I've ever sung
Yeah and all you need from me is everything I've ever said
Everything I've ever done everything I've ever made
Everything I've ever prayed everything I've ever believed
Everything I've ever touched everything I've ever loved
Everything I've ever thought everything I've ever dreamed
Until my whole head screams with grinding my teeth
Desperate to find a single word i can keep
Any kind of faith
Any kind of fix
Oh just any kind of word that doesn't make me sick
And I keep saying I will but I won't
I keep saying I do but I don't
And I keep saying I feel
But there is nothing to feel
Just this strange kind of nothing where it used to be me...
Anything and everything
All that you need
Get it for free
Anything and everything
All that you need
Get it from me
Get it from me
Get it from me
Get it from me




 I want to be old
And creek by the fire
I want to smell of rotting wood
It's all I desire
I want my joints to seize up
I want my legs to ache
I want my eyesight to fail
I want my skin to flake
To be old
I want to be old
I want false teeth
And not be able to chew
I want to be senile
A centigenarian fool
I want lots of wrinkles
Want my hearing to go
I want to be ignored
And I want to be slow
To be old
I want to be old

 Don't say what you mean, you might spoil your face
If you walk in the crowd, you won't leave any trace
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train
It won't take you long to learn the new smile
You have to adapt or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train
If you pick up on it quick
You can say you were there
Again and again and again
You're jumping someone else's train
It's the latest wave that you've been craving for
The old ideal was getting such a bore, now, you're back in line
Going not quite as far but in half the time
Everyone's happy, they're finally all the same
'Cause everyone's jumping, everybody else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train
Jumping someone else's train

 She follows me down to the sound of the sea
Slips to the sand and stares up at me
"is this how it happens? is this how it feels?
Is this how a star falls?
Is this how a star falls?"
The night turns as I try to explain
Irresistible attraction and orbital plane
Or maybe it's more like a moth to a flame?
She brushes my face with her smile
Forget about stars for a while
As she melts
Meanwhile millions of miles away in space
The incoming comet brushes Jupiter's face
And disappears away with barely a trace
"was that it? was that the Jupiter show?
It kinda wasn't quite what I'd hoped for you know
And pulling away she stands up slow
And round her the night turns
Round her the night turns
Yeah that was it
That was the Jupiter crash
Drawn too close and gone in a flash
Just a few bruises in the region of the splash

She left to the sound of the sea
She just drifted away from me
So much for gravity




 Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream she said
The one that makes me laugh she said
Threw her arms around my neck
Show me how you do it and I'll promise you
I'll promise that I'll run away with you, I'll run away with you

Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways, I had to make her glow
Why are you so far away she said
Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?

You, soft and only, you lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water
You're just like a dream
You're just like a dream

Daylight licked me into shape
I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone, alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved and drowned her deep inside of me

You soft and only
You lost and lonely
You just like heaven




 "Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream," she said
"The one that makes me laugh," she said
And threw her arms around my neck
"Show me how you do it and I promise you

I'll run away with you"
Spinning on that dizzy edge
I kissed her face and kissed her head

Lost and lonely

Dancing in the deepest oceans

I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone
Alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me
You
Soft and only
You
Lost and lonely
You
Just like heaven

 Remember the time that you reigned all night?
The Queen of Siam in my arms
Remember the time that the islands sank?
But nobody opened their eyes
Remember that time that the trees fell down?
The wood crashing through the wall
Remember the sound that could wake the dead?
But nobody woke up at all
Somebody died for this
Somebody died
For just one kiss
Just one kiss
Remember the time that the sky went black?
We waited alone on the sands
Remember the taste of the raging sea?
But nobody held out their hands
Somebody died for this
Somebody died
For just one kiss
Just one kiss 




 I remember the time that you rained all night
The queen of Siam in my arms
Remember the time that the islands sank
But nobody opened their eyes

Remember that time that the trees fell down
The wood crashing through the wall
Remember the sound that could wake the dead
But nobody woke up at all

Somebody died for this
Somebody died for just one kiss

Remember the time that the sky went black
We waited alone on the sands
Remember the taste of the raging sea
But nobody held out their hands


Somebody died for this
Somebody died
For just one kiss

Just one kiss

 Standing on the beach
With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel
At the arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth
But i hear no sound

I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

I can turn
And walk away
Or i can fire the gun
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Whichever i chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing


I feel the steel butt jump
Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring at myself
Reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach
The dead man on the beach




 Standing on the beach
With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel
At the arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth
But I hear no sound
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab
I can turn
And walk away
Or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab
I feel the steel butt jump
Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring at myself
Reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach
The dead man on the beach
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab




 Standing on the beach, with a gun in my hand
Staring at the sky, staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel at the other on the ground
I see his open mouth but I hear no sound
I'm alive, I'm dead
I'm a stranger killing another
I can turn and walk away or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky, staring at the sun
Whichever I choose it amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing
I'm alive, I'm dead
I'm a stranger killing another
I feel the silver jump smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea, staring at the sand
Staring at myself reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach
I'm alive, I'm dead
I'm the stranger killing another




 A nightmare of you
Of death in the pool
Wakes me up at quarter to three
I'm lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me
A nightmare of you
Of death in the pool
I see no further now than this dream
The trembling hand of the trembling man
Hold my mouth
To hold in a scream
I try to think
To make it slow
If only here is where I go
If this is real
I have to see
I turn on fire
And next to me
It looks good
It tastes like nothing on earth
It looks good
It tastes like nothing on earth
Its so smooth it even feels like skin
It tells me how it feels to be new

It tells me how it feels to be new
A thousand voices whisper it true
It tells me how it feels to be new
And every voice belongs
Every voice belongs to you




 A nightmare of you of death in the pool

 A nightmare of you of death in the pool
Wakes me up a quarter to three
I’m lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me
A nightmare of you of death in the pool
I see no further than this dream
The trembling hand of the trembling man
Hold my mouth to hold in a scream
It looks good, it tastes like nothing on Earth

It’s so smooth it even looks like skin

It’s so smooth it even looks like skin
It tells me how it feels to be new
It tells me how it feels to be new
Paralyzed by the stars aligned
It tells me how it feels to be new
And every word belongs to you
A nightmare of you of death in the pool
Wakes me up a quarter to three
I’m lying on the floor of the night before
With a stranger lying next to me
A nightmare of you of death in the pool
I see no further than this dream
The trembling hand of the trembling man
Hold my mouth to hold in a scream
It tells me how it feels, it tells me how it feels to be new
Didn’t find the sense, it finally went away
And everyone belongs, everyone belongs to you




 Say it's the same sun
Spinning in the same sky
Say it's the same stars
Streaming in the same night
Tell me it's the same world
Whirling through the same space
Tell me it's the same time
Tripping through the same day
So say it's the same house
And nothing in the house has changed
Yeah, say it's the same room
And nothing in the room is strange
Oh, tell me it's the same boy
Burning in the same bed
Tell me it's the same blood
Breaking in the same head
Say it's the same taste
Taking down the same kiss

Say it's the same you
And it's always been like this
Say it's the same you
And it'll always and forever is

Say it's the same you
And it's always been like this
Say it's the same you
And it'll always and forever is
Say it's the same you

Yeah tell me it's all the same
This is how it's always been
But if nothing has changed
Then it must mean
Aow
But the sun is cold, the sky is wrong
The stars are black, the night is gone
The world is still, the space is stopped
The time is out, the day is dropped
The house is dark, the room is scarred
The boy is stiff, the bed is hard
The blood is thick, the head is burst
The taste is dry, the kiss is thirst

And it's not the same you
No it never was like this
It's not the same you
And it never really is

It's not the same you
No it never was like this
It's not the same you
And it never really is
It's not the same you

Oh it's not the same
This isn't how it's always been
Everything has to have changed
Or it's me
Huh




 Today there was a tragedy
Underneath the bridge
A man walked
Cold and blue
Into La Ment
The sky coloured perfect
As the man slipped away
Waving with a last vanilla smile
Somewhere at a table
Two drowned fools
Smoking
Drinking water as they talked
Of how they loved our lady
And oh the smell as candles die

One more ice cream river body
Flowed underneath the bridge
Underneath the bridge

 I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Expectantly, too punctual, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But older than me now, more constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment that hangs in abasement
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl

Oh, I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
Walking through walls in the heart of December
The blindness, the happiness, falling down laughing
But I really believed that this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
All this in an instant before I can kiss you
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl

Your name like ice into my heart

I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Reluctantly, cautiously, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
And even if we drink, I don't think we will kiss
In the way that we did when the woman was only a girl

A woman now standing
Where once there was only a girl
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
The walking through walls
In the heart of December
The blindness of happiness
Of falling down laughing
And I really believed

Flatter and colder

 Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

Let me take your hand
I'm shaking like milk
Turning
Turning blue
All over the windows and the floors
Fires outside in the sky
Look as perfect as cats
The two of us
Together again
But it's just the same
A stupid game

But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it
If you won't say it first
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

You think you're tired now
But wait until three
Laughing at the Christmas lights
You remember from December
All of this then back again
Another girl
Another name
Stay alive but stay the same
It's just the same
A stupid game

But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it
If you won't say it first
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

You can't even see now
So you ask me the way
You wonder if it's real
Because it couldn't be rain
Through the right doorway
And into the white room
It used to be the dust that would lay here
When I came here alone

But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it
If you won't say it first
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo

 She walked out of her house
And looked around
At all the gardens that looked
Back at her house
(Like all the faces
That quiz when you smile)
And he was standing
At the corner
Where the road turned dark
A part of shiny wet
Like blood the rain fell
Black down on the street
And kissed his feet, she fell
Her head an inch away from heaven
And her face pressed tight
And all around the night sang out
Like cockatoos
"There are a thousand things" he said
"I'll never say those things to you again"
And turning on his heel
He left a trace of bubbles
Bleeding in his stead

And in her head
A picture of a boy who left her
Lonely in the rain
(And all around the night sang out
Like cockatoos)




 




 I can't find myself

In the head of this stranger in love
Holding on, given up
To another under faded setting sun
And I wonder where I am
Could she run away with him?
So happy and so young
And I stare
As I sing in the lost voice of a stranger in love
Out of time, letting go
In another world that spins around for fun
And I wonder where I am
Could he ever ask her why?
So happy and so young
And I stare

But I can't find myself
I can't find myself

In the heart of this stranger in love
Given up, holding on
To this other under faded setting sun
And I'm not sure where I am
Would he really turn away?
So happy and so young
And I stare
As I play out the passion of a stranger in love
Letting go of the time
In this other world that spins around for one
And I'm not sure where I am
Would she know it was a lie?
So happy and so young
And I stare

But I can't find myself
I can't find myself

In the soul of this stranger in love
No control over one
To the other under faded setting sun
I don't know where I am
Should he beg her to forgive?
So happy and so young
And I stare
As I live out the story of a stranger in love
Waking up going on
In the other world that spins around undone
I don't know where I am
Should she really say goodbye?
So happy and so young
And I stare

But I can't find myself
I can't find myself
I got lost in someone else




 Love is real, real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved
Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved
Love is you
You and me
Love is knowing
We can be
Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved




 Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you
Fly me to the moon

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you




 Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you




 (cover De Joy Division)
When routine bites hard, and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed our respect run so dry?
(on the Peel version, Ian sings here:
Is my timing that flawed have our feelings run dry?)
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives
Love, love will tear us apart again
You cry out in your sleep all my failings expose
There's a taste in my mouth, as desperation takes hold
Just that something so good just can't function no more
When love, love will tear us apart again




 I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

On candy stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realize with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

‘Come into my parlor,’ said the spider to the fly
‘I have a little something here’




 I spy something beginning with S...
On candystripe legs the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom and
Suddenly!
A movement in the corner of the room!
And there is nothing I can do
When I realise with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight!
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
"Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning I will wake up
In the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry...

"Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry
"Come into my parlour" said the spider to the fly
"I have something"




 I spy something beginning with 's'
On candy stripe legs, the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim, shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly, a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do, and I realize with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight
Quietly he laughs, shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
"Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"

 Hello image
Sing me a line from your favourite song
Twist and turn
But you're trapped in the light
All the directions were wrong

You'll fall in love with somebody else tonight

Help yourself
But tell me the words
Before you fade away
You reveal all the secrets
To remember the end
And escape someday

You'll fall in love with somebody else again tonight

Take a step
You move in time
But it's always back
The reasons are clear
Your face is drawn
And ready for the next attack




 I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating
I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore
The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic
Like I think, I'm at the racing, like the night before
I remember one girl standing, one was sitting on the ground
One was holding me up, the other pulling me down
And I couldn't decide which one was real
Because there wasn't a sound, like I was pregnant again
I woke up at seven and my body was vibrating
I was wrapped up in a blanket, I was gray, damp and sore
The bedroom was an engine and my heartbeat was erratic
Like I think, I'm at the racing, like the night before
"Don't move, don't smile, don't blink, don't even breathe"
And she said, "Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head"
So I was sucking, I was sucking like a fat lady would
But I couldn't hold it down another second
"Don't twitch, don't shout, don't think, don't even breathe"
She said, "Or the photograph will spoil and cut you off at the head"
So I was sweating, I was sweating like a fat lady would
And I woke up with a man inside my mouth
This won't hurt at all




 No I won't do it again
I don't want to pretend
If it can't be like before
I've got to let it end
I don't want what I was
I had a change of head
But maybe, someday
Yeah maybe, someday
I've got to let it go
And leave it gone
Just walk away
Stop it going on
Get, too scared to jump
If I wait too long
But maybe, someday

Yeah
I'll see you smile as you call my name
Start to feel and it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday's come
Maybe someday's come again
So tell me someday's come
Tell me someday, come again

No I won't do it some more
Doesn't make any sense
If we can't be like it was
I've got to let it rest
I don't want what I did
I had a change of tense
But maybe someday


If I could do it again
Maybe just once more
Think I could make it work
Like I did it before
If I could try it out
If I could just be sure
That maybe someday is the last time
Yeah maybe someday, is the end
Or maybe someday, is when it all stops
Or maybe someday always comes again




 No I won't do it again
I don't want to pretend
If it can't be like before
I've got to let it end
I don't want what I want
I've had a change of head
But maybe someday
Yeah maybe someday
I've got to let it go
And leave it gone
Just walk away
Stop it going on
Get too scared to jump
If I wait too long
But maybe someday
Yeah I'll see you smile
As you call my name
Start to feel
And it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday is come
Maybe someday is come again...
So tell me someday's come
Tell me someday's come again
No I won't do it some more
It doesn't make any sense
If it can't be like it was
I've got to let it rest
I don't want what I did
I had a change of taste
But maybe someday
Yeah I'll see you smile
As you call my name
Start to feel
And it feels the same
And I know that maybe someday is come
Maybe someday is coming
If I could do it again
Maybe just once more
Think I could make it work
Like I did before
If I could try it out
If I could just be sure
Then maybe someday is the last time
Yeah maybe someday is the end
Or maybe someday is when it all stops
Or maybe someday always comes again




 I went into the butchers
I said wanted wanted wanted some meat
Pass Me some of that steak over there
It looks so sweet
I lost my heart to a meathook
That butcher man was some lady
He really stole my heart
He hung me up on his meathook
A real piece of slaughterhouse art
I lost my heart to a meathook
There's a meathook in my heart
Tearing me all apart
Ripping out my insides
But I just can't get away
I can't leave my meathook
Lost my heart to a meathook 
Meathook




 Oow
The sun is up
I'm so happy I could scream!
And there's nowhere else in the world I'd rather be
Than here with you
It's perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Oh, I almost can't believe that it's for real
So pinch me quick
I really don't think it gets any better than this
Vanilla smile
And a gorgeous strawberry kiss!
Birds sing we swing
Clouds drift by and everything is like a dream
It's everything I wished

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it again?
I know we should!!!


The sun is up
I'm so fizzy I could burst!
Yeah you wet through and me headfirst
Into this is perfect
It's all I ever wanted
Ow! It feels so big it almost hurts!

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it some more
I know we should

Say it will always be like this
The two of us together
It will always be like this
Forever and ever and ever
(And ever and ever)
(And ever and ever and ever ever)

Never guessed it got this good
Wondered if it ever would
Really didn't think it could
Do it all the time?
I know that we should!!!

 For a second of your life
Tell me that it's true
Waiting for a sign
It's all I want of you
Your heart hides a secret
A promise of what is
Something more than this
Just a second of your time
Anyone will do
A taste of any other
Is all I want from you
Offer me the world
And how can I resist
Something more than this
Make believe in magic
Make believe in dreams
Make believe impossible
Nothing as it seems
See, touch, taste, smell, hear
But never know if it's real
(Never know if it's real)
For a second of your life
Tell me if it's true
Anywhere we are
It's all I want of you
Your lips lies a secret
A promise of a kiss
Of something more than this
Just a second of your time
Anyone will do
To know any other
Is all I want from you
Giving me the world
Now I can't resist
Something more than this
Make believe in magic
Make believe in dreams
Make believe impossible
Nothing as it seems
Never really understand
What anything means
(What anything means)
Another second of my life
Not knowing if it's true
Make believe in nothing
Is all I want of you
Whisper me a secret
Whisper me there is
Always something other
Something more than this




 You look so cool
Oh I don't think!
Just fall over
Be like me
Mr. Pink Eyes
Your mind is blank
And mine's away
Oh you can't see
You can't smell
Mr. Pink Eyes
It's got to be jazz!
That's what she wants
You are so vile
Mr. Pink Eyes
Oh give me a look
Give me a look
Or sit on my head
Or jump on my foot
Do something!




 She wants so much to please me
She always does it right
She wants so much to please me
All day and every night
She doesn't read the stars
She has no time for fate
She doesn't see the signs
She has no time to wait
She is trying to be the one for me
Trying to be enough for me
She is trying to be the one for me
Trying to be in touch
She is trying to be the one for me
Trying to be enough for me
She is trying to be the one for me
Trying to be in love
I want so much to need her
I never turn away
I want so much to need her
All night and every day
I never read the stars
I have no time for fate
I never see the signs
I have no time to wait
I am trying to be the one for her
Trying to be enough for her
I am trying to be the one for her
Trying to be in touch
I am trying to be the one for her
Trying to be enough for her
I am trying to be the one for her
Trying to be in love
We want so much to have this
We hold each other tight
Yeah, we want so much to have this
Always and everytime
We don't need to read the stars
We don't need the time for fate
We don't need to see the signs
To know it's all too late
She will never be the one for me
She will never be enough
She will never be the one for me
We will never be in touch
I will never be the one for her
I will never be enough
I will never be the one for her

We will never be in love
We will never be
We will never be in love
We will never be
We will never be in love

 New day
In heaven the ground is waiting
For the dust
The seed
My love once more
I shout
New day
Hold the air and gasp in life
This solid dance
This cold cold night
Is gone...
The dark heat throbs
The fools' sweat swims
The hazy lights
The deadly sins
Are gone...
Crack the stone
Invade my head
Dropping honey dropping dead again
The silence shouts
Across the gap
Another dreaming
Love me again
Shout...

 Yeah this is how it ends
After all these years
Tired of it all
Hopelessly helplessly broken apart
He finally falls
He doesn't want to think
Doesn't want to feel
Doesn't want to know what's going on
Says there's nothing he can do will change anything
He doesn't want to know what's going wrong
Because he's in love with a drug
One that makes him numb
One that stops him feeling at all
He's in love with a drug
Forget everyone
He really doesn't care anymore
Anymore
Yeah this is how it ends
After all this time
Everything just fades away
Worn-out and empty and all alone
With nothing left to say
Oh it's all too big to make a difference
It's all too wrong to make it right
Yeah everything is too unfair
Everything too much to bear
He doesn't have the strength left for the fight
Says all he wants is the drug
The one that makes him numb
The one that stops him feeling at all
He just wants to take the drug
Forget everyone
He doesn't want to care anymore
Just keeps loving the drug
The one that makes him numb
The one that stops him feeling at all
Just keeps loving the drug
The drug that he's become
He isn't really here anymore

And that makes me cry




 "One by one they drop", you said
Left us two on a ride stopped dead
It's monkeys on the track
All fell out of their tree
"Lost their tails", I said
"In the deep dark sea"
So take me on the ice and push me around
And every time I fall, I kiss the ground
You skate on by without a sound
Yeah, I'm in love with you cold
Any warmer and I drown
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Oh, anything at all
I'm only here to please you
In any way I can
There's really nothing in the world I won't do
To get a New York, Disney smile from you
Ow, you're so beautiful it hurts
Ow, the most beautiful girl I ever
Ow, too beautiful for words
Now please, inside beside me
And let's take on the world
"One by one they drop", you said
Left us two on a ride stopped dead
It's hard to be sure
But I swear they're whales
Swimming down the line
Spitting monkey tails
So drag me on the floor and get me to twirl
And every twist around, I buss you first
You spin right through a perfect blur
Yeah, I'm in love with you quick
Any slower and I burst
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Yeah, anything at all
I'm only here to please you
In any way I can
There's really nothing I won't do
To get a New York Disney smile from you
Ow, you're so beautiful it hurts
Ow, the most beautiful girl I ever
Ow, too beautiful for words
Now please, inside beside me
And let's take on the world
"One by one they drop", you said
Left us two on a ride stopped dead
It's vultures on the rail
And they're packed down tight
"Best get close", I said
"This could take all night"




 You know you turn me on
Eyes so white and legs so long
But don't try to talk to me
I won't listen to your lies
You're just an object in my eyes 
Sophisticated smile
You seduce in such fine style
But don't try to fool me
Cause I can see through your disguise
You're just an object in my eyes

But I don't mind
I just don't care
I've got no objection
To you touching me there
Object object 

You know just what to do
Lick your lips
And I want you
But don't try to hold me
Cause I don't want any ties
You're just an object in my eyes 


But I don't mind
I just don't care
I've got no objections
To you touching me there
You're just an object object
Object object
You're just an object




 You know you turn me on
Eyes so wide and legs so long
But don't try to talk to me
I won't listen to your lies
You're just an object in my eyes
You're just an object in my eyes
Sophisticated smile
You seduce in such fine style
But don't try to fool me
'Cause I can see through your disguise
You're just an object in my eyes
You're just an object in my eyes
But I don't mind
Just don't care
I've got no objections
To you touching me
Object, object
Object, object
Object, object
Object, object
You know just what to do
Lick your lips and I want you
But don't try to hold me
'Cause I don't want any ties
You're just an object in my eyes
You're just an object in my eyes
But I don't mind
No, I just don't care
I got no objections
To you touching me there
You're just an object, object
Object, object
You're just an object, object
You're just an object




 I don't think I'm any closer now
Than I was at fifteen
I still don't know
What I really want
Or how I really feel
Sometimes I think
I've seen too much
Sometimes nothing at all
And sometimes I think
I just forgot
What I was looking for
But I still need to believe in you
I still need to know you'll never
Never give up
I believe in you...
So how can you ever let
My hope turn to despair?
How can you ever stop
Telling me you care?
But I still need to believe in you
I still need to know you'll never
Never give up
I believe in you...
So how can you ever let
My hope turn to despair?
Tell me you believe it too
Tell me that you care
How can you ever let
My hope turn to despair?
How can you ever stop
Pretending?




 




 It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time
A story on the radio
Something small falls out of your mouth
And we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me
Meet my mother
But the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow 

Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything?
She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling
A little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday
The death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me round
Just like the old days 
Caressing an old man
And painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance
Under a black flag
A hundred years of blood
Crimson
The ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth
And my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water
Over and over
We die one after the other
Over and over
We die one after the other
One after the other

It feels like a hundred years
One hundred years




 It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time a story on the radio
Something small falls out of your mouth
And we laugh, a prayer for something better
A prayer for something better, please love me
Meet my mother, but the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on the television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything? She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling
A little black haired girl, waiting for Saturday
The death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me around
Just like the old days, just like the old days
Just like the old days, just like the old days
Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All the shadows and deliverance under a black flag
A hundred years of blood crimson
A ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water, over and over
We die one after the other, over and over
We die one after the other
One after the other, one after the other
One after the other, one after the other
It feels like a hundred years
One hundred years, a hundred years
A hundred years, hundred years




 It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Goin' home time a story on the radio
Somethin' small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for somethin' better
A prayer for somethin' better
Please love me, meet my mother
But the fear takes hold
Creepin' up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow, waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fightin' for freedom on the television
Sharin' the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything? She struggles to get away
The pain and the creepin' feeling
A little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday
The death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me around
Just like the old days, just like the old days
Just like the old days, just like the old days
Caressin' an old man
And paintin' a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat
In a clean room
The soldiers close in
Under a yellow moon
All the shadows and deliverance
Under a black flag
A hundred years of blood
Crimson a ribbon
Tightens 'round my throat
I open my mouth
And my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger
Thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water
Over and over
We die one after the other
Over and over
We die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
After the other
It feels like a hundred years
Hundred years, hundred years
Hundred years, hundred years




 It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Goin' home time a story on the radio

 It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time
A story on the radio
Something small falls out of your mouth
And we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer
For something better
Please love me
Meet my mother
But the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything?
She struggles to get away . . 
The pain
And the creeping feeling
A little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday
The death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me

Just like the old days

A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
One hundred years




 It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time, a story on the radio
Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me, meet my mother

Creeping up the stairs in the dark, waiting for the death blow

Just like the old days
Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance, under a black flag
A hundred years of blood, crimson, the ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger, thrashing in the water, thrashing in the water
Over and over, we die one after the other
Over and over, we die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
It feels like a hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years
A hundred years




 I'd love to touch the sky, tonight
I'd love to touch the sky
So take me in your arms
And lift me like a child
And hold me up so high
And never let me go
Take me
Take me in your arms tonight
Hold me
Hold me up so high
And never let me down
Hold me
Hold me up so high
To touch the sky
Just one more time

Take me in your arms, tonight
Take me in your arms
Just one more time




 And I'd love to touch the sky tonight
I'd love to touch the sky
So take me in your arms
And lift me like a child
And hold me up so high
And never let me go
Take me take me in your arms tonight
Hold me hold me up so high
And never let me down
Hold me hold me up so high
To touch the sky just one more time
Take me in your arms tonight
Take me in your arms just one more time
Just one more time




 I really don't know what I'm doing here
I really think I should've gone to bed tonight
But just one drink and there are some people to meet you
I think that you'll like them, I have to say, we do tonight
I promise in less than an hour, we will honestly go
Now why don't I just get you another
While you just say hello
Yeah, just say hello, just say hello
So I'm clutching it tight
Another glass in my hand
And my mouth and the smiles
Moving up as I stand up
Too close and too wide
And the smiles are too bright
And I breathe in too deep
And my head's getting light
But the air is getting heavier and it's closer
I'm starting to sway
And the hands all on my shoulders don't have names
And won't go away

So here I go
Here I go again

Falling into strangers
And it's only just eleven
I'm staring like a child
Until someone slips me Heaven
Take it on my knees
Just like a thousand times before
I get transfixed
That fixed
And I'm just looking at the floor
Just looking at the floor
Yeah, I look at the floor
I'm starting to laugh
Like an animal in pain
I've got blood on my hands
I've got hands in my brain
The first shot of retch
Leaves me gasping for more
I stagger over screaming
On my way to the floor
I'm back on my back
With the lights and the lies in my eyes
And the color and the music's too loud
And my head's all the wrong size


Yeah, I laugh and I jump
And I sing and I laugh
And I dance and I laugh
And I laugh and I laugh
But I can't seem to think
Where this is
Who I am
Why I'm keeping this going
Keep pouring it out
Keep pouring it down
Keeping it going
Keep pouring it down

And the way the rain comes down hard
That's the way I feel inside

I can't take it anymore
This it I've become
This is it like I get
When my life's going numb
I just keep moving my mouth
I just keep moving my feet
I say, "I'm loving you to death
Like I'm losing my breath"
And all the smiles that I wear
And all the games that I play
And all the drinks that I mix
And I drink until I'm sick
And all the faces I make
And all the shapes that I throw
And all the people I meet
And all the words that I know
Makes me sick to the heart, oh, I feel so tired




 I really don't know what I'm doing here
I really think I should've gone to bed tonight
But "Just one drink and there're some people to meet you

I've got hands in my brain
The first short retch
Leaves me gasping for more
And I stagger over screaming
On my way to the floor
And I'm back on my back
With the lights and the lies in my eyes
And the colour and the music's too loud
And my head's all the wrong size

 Whisper your name in an empty room
You brush past my skin
As soft as fur
Taking hold
I taste your scent
Distant noises
Other voices
Pounding in my broken head
Commit the sin
Commit yourself
And all the other voices said
Change your mind
You're always wrong
Always wrong

Come around at Christmas
I really have to see you
Smile at me slyly
Another festive compromise
But I live with desertion
And eight million people
Distant noises
Of other voices
Pulsing in my swinging arms
Caress the sound
So many dead
And all the other voices sing
Change your mind
You're always wrong

 I've been up for days
And I feel like a menagerie
I'm scratching till I bleed
And I keep on seeing
Imaginary lemurs
In the street
In the middle of the day
But as long as I can breathe
Then I know I'll be okay
I'll be alright
I'm out of mind
I'm out of sight
I'm out of sight
I've been up for days
And I feel like a laboratory rat
Inside a maze
And I reel in the monotony of
Screaming
At the moon
In the middle of the day
But as long as I can see it
Then I know I'll be okay
I'll be fine
I'm out of sight
I'm completely out of mind
Completely out of mind
Okay
Alright
Come and watch me shake tonight
Mouth wide
Soft and bright
Bite my hand and scream
Okay
Alright
Come and watch me break tonight
Push deep
Out of sight
Bite my hand and hold on tight...

 When we look back at it all as I know we will
You and me wide eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive?

And I know we have to go
I realize we only get to stay so long
Always have to go back to real lives
Where we belong
When we think back to all this and I'm sure we will
Me and you here and now
Will we forget the way it really is
Why it feels like this and how?
And we always have to go I realize
We always have to say goodbye
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are the reason
Why we want to live another life
We want to feel another time another time
Another time
To feel another time


I know we have to go
I realize we always have to turn away
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are why we stay for another dream
Another day, for another world
Another way, for another way

One last time before it's over
One last time before the end
One last time before it's time to go again




 When we look back on it all, as I know we will
You and me wide-eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive
And I know we have to go, I realise
We only get to stay so long
We always have to go back to real lives
Where we belong
Where we belong
Where we belong
When we think back to all this, and I'm sure we will
Me and you, here and now
Will we forget the way it really is
Why it feels like this, and how
And we always have to go, I realise
We always have to say goodbye
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are the reason why
We want to live another life
We want to feel another time
Another time
Another time
To feel another time
When we look back at it all, as I know we will
You and me, wide-eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive
And I know we have to go, I realise
We always have to turn away
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are why we stay
For another dream, another day
For another world, another way
For another way
One last time before it's over
One last time before the end
One last time before it's time to go again




 I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are
All I can feel
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you

As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering
You running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go
Remembering
You fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

Screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go
Remembering you, fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone-white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels, so much more than everything
Hold for the last time, then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could've held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you
There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world that I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
My pictures of you




 I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel
Remembering you, standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you, running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and whiter than snow
Screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go
Remembering you, fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone-white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels, so much more than everything
Hold for the last time, then slip away quietly

 Shapes in the drink like christ
Cracks in the pale blue wall
I'm walking slowly and quickly but
Always away
Twisting twisting to the floor
Flowers in your mouth and the same dry
Song the routine from laughter land
16 white legs and a row of teeth
I watch you in secrecy
Your dying for the hope is gone
From here we go nowhere again
I'm trapped in my face and I'm changing
Too much
I can't climb out the way I fell in
Jump with me
For that old forgotten dance
The midnight sun will burn you up
Your life is cold
Your life is hot
Your life's too much for words
These occasions are such a relief
Another point another view to send
We start to talk
And it's all so safe
I feed you in my dreams
Footsteps on a wire
High above my head
The stain reveals my real intention
I'm the waiting beast
I'm the twisted nerve
As I dance dance
Back to the body in my bed

Look at the piggy
Piggy in the mirror




 Shapes in the drink like Christ
Cracks in the pale blue wall
I'm walking slowly and quickly but always away
And twisting, twisting to the floor, oh
Flowers in your mouth and the same dry song
The routine from laughter land
Sixteen white legs and a row of teeth
I watch you in secrecy
You're dying for the hope is gone
From here we go nowhere again
Oh, I'm trapped in my face and I'm changing too much
I can't climb out the way I fell in
Jump with me for that old forgotten dance

Your life is cold, your life is hard
Your life is too much for words

Hey, hey, hey, we start to talk and it's all so safe
Oh, I feed you in my dreams
Footsteps on a wire high above my head
The stain reveals my real intention
I'm the waiting beast, I'm the twisted nerve
As I dance, dance back to the body in my bed
As I dance, dance back to the body in my bed
To the body in my bed
Look at the piggy, piggy in the mirror
At the piggy, piggy in the mirror




 Electric line
Racing time
Fire down the wall
Spinning around
The killing ground
It makes you look so small
Henna years
The stinging tears
Flesh on the railway track
The screaming queen
On the TV screen
Is never coming back
Don't suffer no more
Just step inside and listen
Listen to my pillbox tales
Your special days
Your winning ways
You're living out the past
You're lying lies
And tying ties
And running much too fast
But you feel so sick
If you run too quick
And wishing every day
Wishing you were all alone
Wishing you were years away
Don't suffer no more
Just step inside and listen
Listen to my pillbox tales




 Far away
Far away child
Turn your eyes
Far away child

I will sleep
Right down inside you tonight
I will sleep tonight

Pirate ships
Pirate ships child
Merry and bold
Sparkling wits child
Coming to dock
Right at your feet tonight
Coming to dock tonight
In the stars
In the stars child
See the people
In the stars Child
They will sail
Right through your window tonight
Into your window tonight


I will sleep
Right down inside you tonight
I will sleep tonight




 I think it's dark and it looks like it's rain, you said
And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And then you smiled for a second
I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain, you said
And it's all running out like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And then you smiled for a second
Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
It's just the way I smile, you said




 "I think it's dark and it looks like rain", you said

"I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain", you said

 Plastic passion is a hard to handle
Plastic passion is a sold out scandal

Oh it's a plastic passion
It's a plastic passion

Plastic passion is the ladies lover
Plastic passion is the marble mother


Plastic passion is a diamond delight
Plastic passion is the nadir of night

Oh it's a plastic passion
It's a plastic passion 

Plastic passion is a hycoscine heart
Plastic passion is a transparent tart


Plastic passion is a gold guarantee
The plastic passion is murdering me
Oh it's a plastic passion

It's a plastic passion




 Day after day, I let you down
Promise you to change, then change my mind
And every time I promise you It will all be fine
It won't be like this next time
The days you wait, turn into years
Always wait - Helpless tears, hopeless nights
And all the fears, it will always be like this
You give me everything you have
Hoping it will someday be enough
To melt my heart - To make me fall in love
Day after day, I let you down
Promise you to change it all
Then change my mind
And every time I promise you, soon be fine
It won't be like this next time
But tonight we play, I think, the final act
I push too hard and you crack
Walk away - Don't look back
This time you've really gone
You give me everything you have
Knowing it can never be enough
My heart's too old, too hard, too cold for your love




 It's not a case of doing what's right
It's just the way I feel that matters
Tell me I'm wrong
I don't really care
It's not a case of share and share alike
I take what I require
I don't understand
You say it's not fair
You expect me to act like a lover
Consider my moves
And deserve the reward
To hold you in my arms
And wait, and wait
And wait for something to happen
It's not a case of telling the truth
Some lines just fit the situation
Call me a liar, you would anyway
It's not a case of aiming to please
You know you're always crying
It's just your part in the play for today

 I paint your nails
And brush your hair
Until you are so very
Beautiful
I whisper in your ear
And on my knees I tell you that you are
Desirable
You don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Play with me
Play with me
I stroke your neck
And lick your neck
And do just what you tell me to
Sometimes I'll beg
But only when you want me to
Don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Play with me
Play with me
I know that you need me
I know that you care
You know that I may not love you
But I will always be there
I paint your nails
And brush your hair
And tell you that you are so very
Beautiful
I whisper in your ear
And on my knees I tell you that you are
Desirable
Don't need to cage me
To close all the doors
As long as you keep me
I will always be yours
Won't you play with me?
Play with me
Won't you play with me?
Please come play with me

 A hand in my mouth
A life spills into the flowers
We all look so perfect
As we all fall down
In an electric glare
The old man cracks with age
She found his last picture
In the ashes of the fire
An image of the queen
Echoes round the sweating bed
Sour yellow sounds inside my head
In books and films
And in life, and in heaven
The sound of slaughter
As your body turns
But it's too late
One more day like today and I'll kill you
A desire for flesh and real blood
I'll watch you drown in the shower
Pushing my life through your open eyes
But it's too late
I must fight this sickness
Find a cure
I must fight this sickness




 A hand in my mouth, a life spills into the flowers
We all look so perfect as we all fall down
In an electric glare, the old man cracks with age
She found his last picture in the ashes of the fire
An image of the queen echoes 'round the sweating bed
Sour yellow sounds inside my head
In books and in films, and in life and in heaven
The sound of slaughter as your body turns
But it's too late
One more day like today and I'll kill you
A desire for flesh and real blood
And I'll watch you drown in the shower
Push my life through your open eyes
I must fight this sickness, find a cure
I must fight this sickness




 The other one feeds on my hesitation
Grows inside of my trepidation
Buries his claws in my dislocation
I whisper your name to lose control
I take a step and over my shoulder
His roll-white eyes shine wilder and bolder
His snow-white thighs press closer and colder
Murmur in me to let him go
The other one thrives on my desperation
Fills me up with my intoxication
Sinks his teeth in my deviation
Suffering me to lose control
Hold my mouth, taste his breath
Hissing, breathing are the same
Snakes its sound inside my head
Sickening me to let him go
I take a step and over my shoulder
His pain-white eyes shine wilder and bolder
His stain-white thighs press closer and colder
Murdering me to let him go
I try to resist the gruesome kiss
I twist to deny the blood-hot bliss
But I always feel myself becoming him
And the last thing I remember
It isn't me, it isn't me, it isn't me
But then it never is...




 You shatter me
Your grip on me - a hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me
Infectious sense of hopelessness and prayers for rain
I suffocate
I breathe in dirt and nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again all waiting for the rain
You fracture me
Your hands on me - a touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain
I deteriorate
I live in dirt and nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again all waiting for the rain
You fracture me
Your hands on me - a touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me
Entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain
Prayers for rain

 The innocence of sleeping children
Dressed in white
And slowly dreaming
Stops all time
Slow my steps and start to blur
So many years have filled my heart
I never thought i'd say those words

The further we go
And older we grow
The more we know
The less we show

The very first time i saw your face
I thought of a song
And quickly changed the tune
The very first time i touched your skin
I thought of a story
And rushed to reach the end
Too soon
Oh, remember
Oh, please don't change

So the fall came
Thirteen years
A shiny ring
And how i could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat
Another perfect lie is choked
But it always feels the same

So they close together
Dressed in red and yellow
Innocent forever
Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms
Still dream




 The innocence of sleeping children dressed in white and slowly dreaming stops all time
I slow my steps and start to blur, so many years have filled my heart, I never thought I'd say those words
(The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show
The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show)
The very first time I saw your face I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon
Oh, remember. Oh, please don't change

The air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked but it always feels the same
So they close together, dressed in red and yellow, innocent forever. Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream
(The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show
The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show)

 Scarred
Your back was turned
Curled like an embryo
Take another face
You will be kissed again
I was cold as I mouthed the words
And crawled across the mirror
I wait
Await the next breath
Your name
Like ice into my heart
A shallow grave
A monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes
And eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon
Another past time
Your name
Like ice into my heart
Everything as cold as life
Can no-one save you?
Everything
As cold as silence
And you will never say a word
Your name
Like ice into my heart




 Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Acting funny but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky
Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm climbin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me
Help me... Help me...
Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blown, blown my mind
Is it tomorrow or the end of time?
Help me... Help me...

 Go, go, go
Push him away
No, no, no
Don't let him stay

He gets inside to stare at her
The seeping mouth
The mouth that knows
The secret you
Always you
A smile to hide the fear away
Oh, smear this man across the walls
Like strawberries and cream
Its the only way to be

Exactly the same clean room
Exactly the same clean bed
But I've stayed away too long this time
And I've got too big to fit this time




 Go, go, go
Go, go, go

Exactly the same clean bed

 Oh I really love it here!
Oh you've thought of it all!
Candlelight! coconut ice! and fur on the floor!
And I realy love the way you wear your hair
And nothing more
So tell me
What is going on?
I was sure that I'd already gone

But all you say is we're all spinning
It's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be

A prisoner in pvc a minute after three
It didn't used to be like this
Must be all that sleep I missed

Yeah but I really love it here!
You've done everything to please!
Stolichnaya! Banco de Gaia! Bad Timing on tv!
And I really love the way you turn
Your smile into striptease
But I'm still not sure what's going on
And I can't help feeling something's wrong


Still wrapped inside your rubber as I wriggle at your feet
No it didn't used to be like this
Must be something strange I kissed
Maybe when my eyes were closed?

So tell me what is going on?
I'm sure that I've already gone
But all you say is we're all spinning
And it's really not just me
But that doesn't seem to help me figure out how I can be
Still fixed inside your fantasy
A tv refugee
So tell me what is going on?
Just can't help feeling something's wrong
Or is it right this way I feel?
Someone get me out of here!
I'm waiting on my knees




 Round and round and round and round and round we go
Trying so hard to get a hold of everyone here
We've got to show how much we love them all
We squeak with idiot fake surprise
Flap our hands and flutter our eyes
And lap up all their stupid lies
We've got to love them all

And I really don't know why we do it like this
Imitation smiles and how "it's wonderful to be here!
I'm really not sure what we're so scared we'll miss

So round and round and round and round and round we go
Hanging on every shape they throw
It's strange the way we can't say no
Until we love them all
So we laugh at every stupid joke
And smoke and choke and point and poke
And gag on countless lines
How much we love them all!


Maybe it's the sex with the drugs and the fools
Or maybe it's the promise of belief?
Maybe it's the pleasure and the pain of the cruel
Or maybe it's the promise of relief?
And I know that we've said it so many times before
Once more and never again
But however many times that we've said it before
Once more is never the end




 Shout!
Shout!
Shout!
New day
New lie
I see this again
The same
This time has gone again
This
In the sky
This
Here in my hand
Shout!
Jumping on it from the trees
Doing the same
On the air
On the air
Shout!
Shout!
In heaven the ground is waiting
See my eye
Once more
It's been the same song
Babbling
On this
On all of you
Shout!
Shout!
Shout!




 You know those things I said
All those things that made you cry
I didn't really mean that stuff
I didn't really mean that stuff
All I ever really mean
When I scream and shout the way I do
Is I don't know
I really don't
I'm just the same as you
You know those things I said
All those things that made you
Run away from me
I didn't mean a word
I didn't really mean I don't believe
All I ever really mean
When I rant and rave the way I do
Is I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm just as scared as you
And sometimes it's so hard
Not to just throw it all away
Sometimes it's so hard
Not to just throw it all away
Like all those things I said
All those things that made you cry
I didn't really mean that stuff
I didn't really mean to say goodbye
You know those things I said
All those things that made you
Run away from me
I didn't mean a word
I didn't really mean I don't believe
All I ever really mean
When I scream and shout the way I do
Is I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm just as scared as you




 When you screw up your eyes
When you screw up your face
When you throw out your arms
And keep changing your shape
Taste the taste in your mouth
Taste the taste on your tongue
On the film on your eyes of what I've become
What do I do when you screw up your eyes?
What do I do when you screw up your face?
What do I do when you throw out your arms
Fall on the floor
And keep changing your shape?
Jump right into your mouth?
Jump around on your tongue?

And the film on your eyes of the way I've become
Makes me sick at the way that I try
Anything in the world
To impress that I'm doing this
Only for you




 When you screw up your eyes
When you screw up your face
When you throw out your arms
And keep changing your shape
Time to taste in your mouth
Time to taste on your tongue
On the film on your eyes
Of the way I've become
What do I do when you screw up your eyes?
What do I do when you screw up your face?
What do I do when you throw out your arms
Fall on the floor and keep changing your shape?
Jump right into your mouth
Jump around on your tongue
And the film on your eyes
Of the way I've become
Makes me sick at the way that I try anything in the world
To impress that I'm doing this only for you
It's only for you
Only for you




 Secrets
Share with another girl
Talking all night in a room
All night
Everything's slowing down
I wish I was yours
Strangers
Nobody knows we love
I catch your eyes in the dark
One look relives the memory
Remember me
The way I used to be

 (La la la la la la la...)
I stopped the car
The other day
I had to ask a little
Girl the way
I thought she'd show me
Better if she got inside
And once inside
I thought I'd taker her
For a little ride...
So I see the children
Feel the children
See the children
Feel the children
All the time...
See the children
Feel the children
See the children
Feel the children
All the time...
I'm a supermarket Santa
Underneath the Christmas tree
The little one all like to
Come and sit upon my knee
I have to hold them tightly
'cause they fall to the floor
A little concern ain't
Against the law...
So I see the children
Feel the children
See the children
Feel the children
All the time
See the children
(something something something??) all the time
I pass by the infant school
Every single day
I push sweeties through the fence
But the kids just run way
I only want to talk with them
And join in their fun
But all the little children do
Is run run run run run run run run...
(La la la la la la, la la la la la la.. Etc..)
See the children
Feel the children all the time..
See the children
Feel the children
See the children
Feel the children
All the time........




 Time slips away
And the light begins to fade
And everything is quiet now
Feeling is gone
And the picture disappears
And everything is cold now
The dream had to end
The wish never came true
And the girl starts to sing
Seventeen seconds
A measure of life

 Ha ha ha
Wake up in the dark
The after-taste of anger in the back of my mouth
Spit it on the wall
And cough some more
And scrape my skin with razor blades

And make up in the new blood
And try to look so good
Follow me
Make up in the new blood
And follow me to where the real fun is
Ha ha ha
As stale and selfish as a sick dog
Spurning sex like an animal of god
I'll tear your red hair by the roots
And hold you blazing
Hold you cherished in the dead electric light
Your face
I'll never see you this way again
I captured it so perfectly
As if I knew you'd disappear away

Shake shake shake shake
Shake dog shake
Shake shake shake shake
Shake dog shake

You hit me again
You howl and hit me again
The same sharp pain
Wakes me in the dark
And cuts me from my throat to my pounding heart
My heart
My shaking heart
My howl my shake dog


But we slept all night in the virgin's bed
And dreamed of death
And breathed like sick dogs
We slept all night in the virgin's bed
And breathed like death
And dreamed of sick dogs


Wake up wake up wake up
Shake shake shake shake

 You're just a waste of time
You're just a babbling face
You're just three sick holes that run like sores
You're a fucking waste
You're like a slug on the girl
Oh, you're useless and ugly
And useless and ugly
And I shiver and shake
When I think of how you make me hate
I want to smash you to pieces
I want to smash you up and screaming
I want to smash you helpless
Down on the floor
Smash you until you're not here anymore

And I shiver and shake
Shiver and shake




 




 I chose an eternity of this
Like falling angels
The world disappeared
Laughing into the fire
Is it always like this?
Flesh and blood and the first kiss
The first colours
The first kiss
We writhed under a red light
Voodoo smile
Siamese twins
A girl at the window looks at me for an hour
Then everything falls apart
Broken inside me
It falls apart
The walls and the ceiling move in time
Push a blade into my hands
Slowly up the stairs
And into the room
Is it always like this?
Dancing in my pocket
Worms eat my skin
She glows and grows
With arms outstretched
Her legs around me
In the morning I cried
Leave me to die
You won't remember my voice
I walked away and grew old
You never talk
We never smile
I scream
You're nothing
I don't need you any more
You're nothing
It fades and spins
Fades and spins
Sing out loud
We all die
Laughing into the fire

Is it always like this?

 Nothing I do makes much sense
Say you don't really get me anymore
I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
Nothing I want means a lot
Say you don't understand me like before
I'm not sure if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
Nothing I think has a point
Say you don't quite believe me anymore
I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
Gets hard to guess the best way through
The thing to do if none of this is true
I wish I knew how to undo
The doubt I hide inside
I grew in you...
The knot I hide inside I tied in you...
Nothing I am shows the way
Say you don't seem to know me like before
I'm not sure if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
No nothing I do makes much sense
Say you don't really get me anymore
I wonder if you ever did... if you ever did at all?
Gets hard to guess the best way through
The thing to do if none of this is true
I wish I knew how to undo
The knot I tied in you...
When more or less the yes and no
Is all for show it isn't really so...
Look high and low where did we go?
You moved too fast or maybe I just moved too slow?
There's so much noise...
All the signal seems to fade away
Too much noise...
Or could be this is how it always sounds
With nothing left?

 I am slowing down
As the years go by
I am sinking
So I trick myself
Like everybody else
The secrets I hide
Twist me inside
They make me weaker
So I trick myself
Like everybody else
I crouch in fear and wait
I'll never feel again

If only I could remember
Anything at all




 I am slowing down, as the years go by
I am sinking, so I trick myself like everybody else
The secrets I hide, twist me inside
They make me weaker
So I trick myself, like everybody else
I crouch in fear and wait - I'll never feel again
If only I could remember, anything at all

 It could've been her golden hair
That turned my head
I didn't look to stare
Like I was hypnotized
But I was fixed
On how she pointed slowly down
And low I sank
And still without a sound
The world was far away
And I was tricked
It could've been her silver skin
That drew me on
I didn't mean to spin
Like I was mesmerised
But I was rapt
Without a name or memory
I waited there
Too scared to even breathe

She sang... she sang... she sang
She sang
Tell me you love me
And beg me to stay
She sang
Tell me you love me
Before it's too late
She sang
"Give me your life
Or I must fly away
And you will never hear this song again

It could've been her crystal eyes
That made me stop
I didn't want to sigh
Like I was stupefied
But I was thrown
And at that point of no return
My whole life hanging
On a single word
To be hers evermore
Or mine alone




 This is stranger than I thought
Six different ways inside my heart
And everyone I'll keep tonight
Six different ways go deep inside

I'll tell them anything at all
I know I'll give them more and more

They think I'm on my hands and head
This time they're much too slow
Six sides to every lie I say
It's that American voice again
It was never quite like this before
Not one of you is the same

 Sleep when I'm dead, you angels
I'll sleep when I'm dead, I said
Sleep when I'm dead, you angels
I'll sleep when I'm dead, I said
Sleep when I'm dead, you angels
But until then

They told me I would live forever
If I kept it clean
They said I would be the chosen one
If I took one for the team
Yeah, it's the only way to be
Never think it isn't fair
That's a green eyed panic climb
To the edge of nowhere
Give it to the chicken and see if it ticks
Yeah, give it to the kitten and see if it sicks
Then give it to the wonderful, wonderful me
And I will tell on my return the way it is

With all the happy boys and girls
Yeah, the whole happy world
And the love they feel for me
Yeah, the love they feel for me


They told me I could run the world
If I kept it quiet
They said I could be the man
If I took it out of sight
In a monkey suit again
Having fun with all your friends
How a casual hour can pull
All this world to pieces
Give it to the bunny and see if she kicks
Yeah, give it to the puppy and see if he sticks
Then give it to the wonderful, wonderful me
I'll let you know when I get back just how it is

With all the other boys and girls
Yeah, the whole
Other world

And the way it stirs inside
And the why it never burns at night
And the way they make the climb
And the why they never pray for time
And the way I show surprise
And the why I never close my eyes
Yeah, just how it is

But until then

Well, I should at least feel tired I think
Before I lay me down to dream

 High up on this mountain
Oh, the whole world looks so small
All the rivers run away
Slipping on your deep green heart
I drink you as I swim
And I'm sliding, and I'm sliding with you
Slide beneath my skin
Sleek and deep and salty sweet
You open up in me
Just like the snow in summer
High up on this mountain
Oh, the whole world looks so small
All the rivers run away
Slipping in your soft white heart
I drink you as I swim
And I'm falling, and I'm falling with you
Fall beneath my skin
Sleek and deep and salty sweet
You come and close in me
Just like the snow in summer
As it melts into the sea
As it melts into the sea
Snow in summer
Snow in summer
Snow in summer

 It was only yesterday
Waving arms across the street
Your white face left me blue
How can I say all the things
I have to say to you
Oh all the people here
All look the same
The little time I spend with you
We drink each other dry

Mammnnarghaassstmmetc
Speak my language

It was only yesterday
My eyes touched yours across the street
We cut the words
And waved goodbye
And dropped off the edge of the world

Mammnnarghaassstmmetc
Speak my language




 I don't think I ever know
If I ever really want it
Could be why I'm never sure
If I ever really got it
And I guess it's maybe easier
Not to think too much about it...
A house a car a family and friends
Yeah all it means to justify the ends
But sometimes... I wonder...
In the back of my mind
Sometimes... I wonder...
If I'm wasting all my time
Sometimes... I wonder...
If I'm putting off my real life...
What I could've done
Where I could've been
When I should've gone
Why I should've seen
Who I would've loved
How I would've dreamed
And if it's always always too late...
I don't think I ever know
That I ever really need it
Could be why I'm never sure
That I ever really feel it
And I think it's maybe easier
To guess I really mean it...
A house! A car! A family and friends!
Yeah all it means to justify the ends
But sometimes... I wonder...
A girl! A smile! A holiday and sex!
Yeah all it takes
To make sense of the rest
But sometimes... I wonder...
In the back of my mind
Sometimes... I wonder...
If I'm killing all my time
Sometimes... I wonder...
If I'm giving up my real life...
What I could've done
Where I could've been
When I should've gone
Why I should've seen
Who I would've loved
How I would've dreamed
And if it's always, always too late...
And every day that I let slide
Is one day more I never try
To break the world
To make my fate
And with every day that I let go
It's one day less I ever know
If it's always
Always too late...




 Shape is still
Asleep
With the toys
As tall as men
The pictures in the hallway
Turning inside
Whispers
Unseen
Jumping against the sky
Slipping away
He looks
For the last time...




 Let me forget
Let me forget
Or let me go
Let me go
I'll keep it quiet as a whisper
I'll keep it low low low...
Never!
The biggest word I ever heard
Stop dead
Stop dead
You're getting too close...
Before you even opened your eyes
I moved about a million ways
I killed about a million people
And filled about half a day
Before you even opened your eyes
You had to have to ask me who
I love it...
I mean you...
My face was in your hands
You looked into my eyes
You said I tasted right
And swallowed me alive




 Let me forget
Let me forget
Or let me go
Let me go
I'll keep it quiet as a whisper
I'll keep it low low low...
Never!
The biggest word I ever heard
Stop dead
Stop dead
You're getting too close...
Before you even opened your eyes
I moved about a million ways
I killed about a million people
And filled about half a day
Before you even opened your eyes
You had to have to ask me who
I love it...
I mean you...
My face was in your hands
You looked into my eyes
You said I tasted right
And swallowed me alive




 It started with a dedication
Lost in admiration - happy birthday - I'm forever yours - blossom
Faded red inside a tiny book of butterflies
I smiled surprised at how when flickered through
The wings flew by spelled out my name
Six months went by the summer lost
Obsessively the letters dropped into my life
The same soft blood smooth flowing hand
"please try to understand - I have to see you - have to feel you
Tell you all the ways I need you - yours forever in love

Strange attraction spreads it's wings
It varies but the smallest things
You never know how anything will change
Strange attraction spreads it's wings
And alters but the smallest things
You never know how anything will fade

The year grew old incessantly she wrote to me
She'd started smoking poetry!
I laughed in recognition of a favorite phrase
She'd pulled me in
I answered her
A Christmas card in sepia
Arranging when and where
And how the two of us should meet
Her opening so well prepared
A nervous smile
I couldn't take my eyes from her
She whispered
"can I use some of your lipstick?"
It was perfect so believable
I couldn't help but feel that it was real
And kissing crimson fell into her waiting arms


So alone into the cold new year without another word from her
I wrote to ask if we could maybe meet again before the spring
But weeks went by with no reply until once more my birthday came
And with it my surprise but this time nothing was the same
I'm sorry - blame infatuation - blame imagination
I was sure you'd be the one but I was wrong
It seems reality destroys our dreams - I won't forget you - blossom
Faded red inside a tiny book of old goodbyes

 Midnight in the subway
She's on her way home
She tries hard not to run
But she feels she's not alone
Echoes of footsteps
Follow close behind
But she dare not turn around
Turn around




 Midnight in the subway
She's on her way home
She tries hard not to run
But she feels she's not alone
Echoes of footsteps follow close behind
But she dare not turn around
Turn around




 Oh, I wish I could find it funny
You laughing like that
But instead I change into a rage
And run around without a face
I wish I could find it funny
When you never come back
But I don't suppose I'll ever know
The how to keep you
Goodbye, sugar girl
Goodbye, sugar girl




 Sometime it seems
I stopped being myself
And without a word
Turned into somebody else
Full of wishes wants dreams
And desires
For a life
Of conceit and deceit
And repeat and rewrite
Not sure who I was
Before this me and I changed
But I know this me now
Is not really the same

Friends are as strangers
And strangers as friends
And I feel like I'm wired in a why
Yeah my friends are as strangers
And strangers as friends
And I feel like I'm lost in a lie

And every day my world gets slower
And colder and smaller
And older and lower
And every day
My treat gets closer to trick
Yeah every day my world gets slower
And colder and smaller
And older and lower

And I'm tired of being alone with myself
And I'm tired of being with anyone else
Yeah I'm tired
Like I'm sick

None of my favourite things
Are quite right
To the mirror man
Screaming at me
In the spite of another
False start
Dirty worn out and used
Up and down
To the ground
Disavowed
So confused
All made up in the belief
That me is the same
As the eyes in the glass
But I see my eyes change


And every night my world gets quicker
And lighter and shorter
And tighter and slicker
And every night
My truth gets closer to dare
Yeah every night my world gets quicker
And lighter and shorter
And tighter and slicker


Like I'm scared




 Oww!

Tomorrow I can start again
Back to earth and carry on
The same as I did yesterday
Yeah, I'll pick it up once more
And morning I'll be onto it
From square one start
And push it for a bit
Like I do everyday
I'll get it down for sure

But tonight
I climb with you
Tonight
So high with you
Tonight
I shine with you
Tonight
Oh, I'm so alive with you

Tomorrow I'll begin anew
With heavy head to hold it
As I do it all like yesterday
Yeah, I'll break it out again
And morning I'll be there in time
For clock back move
And make it for awhile
To get through everyday
I'll roll it out the same


It's always here and never there
With you
It's always here and never where
With you
It's always here and never how
With you
It's always here and always now

Tomorrow I will start again
Back to earth and carry on
The same as I did yesterday
Yeah I'll pick it up once more
And morning I'll be onto it
Square one start
And bit a for it push
Like I do everyday
I'll get it down for sure

 My temptation is coming from my heart
That skips a bit just like a game
Everytime you call my name, call my name
Its only you
I want you too
Its only you
I want you too
Come
Do you see what I mean talking bout fever
The fire burns inside of me
And you can quench me easily, so
Let me hold you and squeeze you like a fool
Because I'm crazy about you
When you sit down and cross your legs, cross your legs
Temptation
Temptation
Come
Youre sweeping away without a reason
Unless someone else is loving you
Id want to have you by my side, by my side
Temptation
Temptation
Its only you
I want you too!
Its only you
I want you too!
My temptation is coming from my heart
That skips a bit just like a game
Everytime you call my name, call my name
Temptation
Temptation




 Touch me cold
And inviting
Hope saves, if you'd rather go
To my hand or
And watch the unknown suicide
Oh, another trip to heaven
Tear it in the velvet lining
Limbs in the shape of temptation
Sex and parlor eyes
See the sound of blood and sweat
This is oh, my time
Just bless me father
And change into a ??
Change into a
Come to my house
It's a lifelong statues
And sleep to
What is always taking to
My ??
Sleep into temptation
I always sliding into your way
Time to bless me father
Try and out to
Change into
I change into a man
As life is for talking
Found a way underneath
The actor of me swims
He holds me down
Holds me down
Pictures of him
Turn him into
Birds outside are going
Into her hair
Into her face
Makes me space




 "Everyone feels good in the room" she swings
"Two chord cool in the head" she sings
"A-buzz a-buzz a-buzzing like them killer bees "
Tell me this is not for real
Please tell me this is not for real
From time to time her eyes get wide
And she's always got them stuck on me
I'm surprised at how hot honey-coloured and hungry she looks
And I have to turn away to keep from bursting
Yeah I feel that good!
She slips from the stage
A foot no more
But it seems to take an hour for her to reach the floor
And the two chord cool still grooves
As she slides towards me smooth as a snake
I can't swallow I just start to shake
And I just know this is a big mistake
Yeah but it feels good!

Do it to me! do it to me! do it to me! do it to me!
Do it to me! do it to me! do it to me!

"If you want I can take you on another kind of ride
"Believe me I would but
Deep inside the 'but' is 'please'
I am yearning for another taste
And my shaking is 'yes'
"you will be all the things in the world you've never been
See all the things in the world you've never seen
Dream all the things in the world you've never dreamed
But I think I get a bit confused
Am I seducing or being seduced?
Oh I know that tomorrow I'll feel bad
But I really couldn't care about that
She's grinning singing spinning me round and round
Smiling as I start to fall
Her face gets big her face gets small
It's like tonight I'm really not me at all
And it feels good!


It feels good!

 Heaven
Give me a sign
Waiting for the sun to shine
Pleasure fills up my dreams
And I love it
Like a baby screams
Its so useless
How can you be proud
When you're sinking into the ground
Into the ground fills up my dreams

And I love it
Like a baby screams

Couldn't ask for more you said
Take it all
And strike me
Strike me dead

Waiting again
Waiting
Like I waited before
Waiting again
Waiting here for nothing at all
Heaven fills up my dreams

 Tell me who doesn't love
What can never come back
You can never forget how it used to feel
The illusion is deep
It's as deep as the night
I can tell by your tears you remember it all

I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop

How it feels to be dry
Walking bare in the sun
Every mirage I see is a mirage of you
As I cool in the twilight
Taste the salt on my skin
I recall all the tears
All the broken words


When the sunset's glow drifts away from you
You'll no longer know
If any of this was really true at all




 Tell me who doesn't love
What can never come back
You can never forget how it used to feel
The illusion is deep
It's as deep as the night
I can tell by your tears you remember it all

I am paralyzed, by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes, I can never stop
How it feels to be dry
Walking bare in the sun
Every mirage I see, is a mirage of you
As I cool in the twilight
Taste the salt on my skin
I recall all the tears, all the broken words

When the sunsets glow drifts away from you
You'll no longer know
If any of this was really true at all




 Tell me who doesn't love
What can never come back?
You can never forget how it used to feel
The illusion is deep
It's as deep as the night
I can tell by your tears you remember it all, oh
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop
Never stop
How it feels to be dry
Walking bare in the sun
Every mirage I see is a mirage of you
As I cool in the twilight
Taste the salt on my skin
I recall all the tears, all the broken words
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop
Never stop
When the sunset's glow drifts away from you
You'll no longer know
If any of this was really true at all
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop
Never stop
Tell me who doesn't love
What can never come back?
You can never forget how it used to feel
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop
Never stop
I am paralyzed by the blood of Christ
Though it clouds my eyes
I can never stop
Never stop

 Blood of Mary
Fills my glass
Spins crimson in the gloom
Sipping on another cocktail
Waking up in another room
Gaze out on the river
Of the gleaming city sky
Sipping on another cocktail
Watching the world go by
Surge of twilight
Blazing shadows
Seeing things not there
Television flickers
On channel One
And static cracks the air
Come sunshine
Come next time
Come...
Oh! Come along with me!
I will show you life
I will give you my eyes
I will give you security...
Yesterday was yesterday
A nightmare of my past
Sipping on another cocktail
From the same glass
Everyday was yesterday
A nightmare of my past
Sipping on another cocktail
From the same glass...




 I dream of all our days to come
I drag in shapes in lines to burn
And wonder how we end this game
As on and on from stone to stone
The monsters come and go
And every one the step we follow back again
Oh they can run
They can hide
But we will hunt
And we will find them
They can crawl
And then they die
Until our work is done
Yeah they can run
They can hide
But we will hunt
And we will find them
They can crawl
And they will die
That's why it's so much fun!
We only want a song to sing
A story told for us to live
And side by side we fight the beast
Floating words and floating world
We only wish this time we had was all
And spinning round we'll be
Yeah they can run
They can hide
But we will hunt
And we will find them
They come front
And then they die
Until our work is done
So they can run
They can hide
But we will hunt
And we will find them
They come front
And they will die
That's why it's so much fun
Someday
We'll find ourselves in love
A wonderful day
Together on our own
Yes someday
The legends turn to stone
A wonderful day
Just on and on
We make it home
Still wait for all our days to be
I drag in shapes in memory
No wonder if we end the same
Around around around around it goes
The monster's been and gone
And every one the step we follow back again
Yeah always run
Always hide
And always hunt
And always find
But everyone
This week we'll fight
That's why it's won...
Yeah...




 You're too far away
Too far away to touch
And this mother's love inside me
Hurts too much
Prettily waving
Playing on the sand
Dreaming of everything
Dancing, dancing
In our hands
Dancing, dancing 
Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
As I speak
Like the tumbling cat
I watch in fascination
Like a vampire bat
Don't do it, don't do it
Don't do it, don't do it
Don't give it away
We'll use it up tomorrow
If we don't use it today 
Rest your head
Oh, just put it outside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night
The dream
The time love died
The night
The dream
The time our love died
We pushed it in our mouths
Pushed it deep inside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night
The dream
The time love died
The night
The dream
The time our love died




 She stands twelve feet above the flood
She stares
Alone
Across the water
The loneliness grows and slowly
Fills her frozen body
Sliding downwards
One by one her senses die
The memories fade
And leave her eyes
Still seeing worlds that never were
And one by one the bright birds leave her
Starting at the violent sound
She tries to turn
But final
Noiseless
Slips and strikes her soft dark head
The water bows
Receives her
And drowns her at its ease
Drowns her at its ease
I would have left the world all bleeding
Could I only help you love
The fleeting shapes
So many years ago
So young and beautiful and brave

Everything was true
It couldn't be a story
I wish it was all true
I wish it couldn't be a story
The words all left me
Lifeless
Hoping
Breathing like the drowning man

Oh Fuchsia
You leave me
Breathing like the drowning man

 As stiff as toys
And tall as men
And swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poison birds

She talked about the armies
That marched inside her head
And how they made her dreams go bad
But oh how happy she was
How proud she was
To be fighting in the war
In the empty world




 Stiff as toys and tall as men
And swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poisoned birds

That marched inside her head

To be fighting in the war
In the empty world
Stiff as toys and tall as men
Swaying like the wind torn trees
She talked about the empty world
With eyes like poisoned birds




 Go if you want to
I never tried to stop you
Know there's a reason
For all of this you're feeling
Love, it's not my call
You couldn't ever love me more
I don't show much
It's not that hard to hide you
See in a moment
I can't remember how to

Be all you wanted
I couldn't ever love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love

You want me to cry and play my part
I want you to sigh and fall apart
We want this like everyone else
Stay if you want to
I'll always wait to hear you
Say there's a last kiss
For all the times you run this
Way it's not my fault
You couldn't ever love me more
You couldn't love me more

I couldn't ever love you more
I couldn't love you more
I couldn't love

You want me to lie not break your heart
I want you to fly not stop and start
We want us like everything else
Maybe we didn't understand
It's just the end of the world
Maybe we didn't understand
Not just a boy and a girl
It's just the end of the, end of the world
Me I don't say much
It's far too hard to make you
See in a moment
I still forget just how to

Be all you wanted
I couldn't ever love you more
I couldn't love you more

 I couldn't hear a word you said
I couldn't hear at all
You talked until your tongue fell out
And then you talked some more
I knew if I turned, knew if I turned
I'd turn away from you
And I couldn't look back
And I couldn't look back

Tell yourself we'll start again
Tell yourself it's not the end
Tell yourself it couldn't happen
Not this way
Not today
Not today

 Sharp and open
Leave me alone
And sleeping less every night
As the days become heavier and weighted
Waiting in the cold light
A noise, a scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year
A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
I think about tomorrow
Please let me sleep
As I slip down the window
Freshly squashed fly
You mean nothing
I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
All the time
Lose me in the dark
Please do it right
Run into the night
I will lose myself tomorrow
Crimson pain, my heart explodes
My memory in a fire
And someone will listen
At least for a short while
I can never say no to anyone but you
Too many secrets
Too many lies
Writhing with hatred
Too many secrets
Please make it good tonight
But the same image haunts me
In sequence
In despair of time
I will never be clean again
I touched her eyes
Pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again

Touch her eyes
Press my stained face
I will never be clean again

 Two pale figures
Ache in silence
Timeless
In the quiet ground
Side by side
In age and sadness

I watched
And acted wordlessly
As piece by piece
You performed your story
Moving through an unknown past
Dancing at the funeral party

Memories of children's dreams
Lie lifeless
Fading
Lifeless
Hand in hand with fear and shadows
Crying at the funeral party

I heard a song
And turned away
As piece by piece
You performed your story
Noiselessly across the floor
Dancing at the funeral party

 Creatures kissing in the rain
Shapeless in the dark again
In the hanging garden
Please don't speak
In the hanging garden
No one sleeps
In the hanging garden

Catching haloes on the moon
Gives my hands the shapes of angels
In the heat of the night
The animals scream
In the heat of the night
Walking into a dream

Fall fall fall fall
Into the walls
Jump jump out of time
Fall fall fall fall
Out of the sky
Cover my face as the animals cry
In the hanging garden

Creatures kissing in the rain
Shapeless in the dark again
In a hanging garden
Change the past
In a hanging garden
Wearing furs
And masks

Fall fall fall fall
Into the walls
Jump jump out of time
Fall fall fall fall
Out of the sky
Cover my face as the animals die
In the hanging garden
As the animals die
Cover my face as the animals die

In the hanging garden




 The animal runs slow across me
I'm so tired
I can only fall
The black is dripping
In the hanging garden
Please don't speak
Blood in my ears and eyes like ice
Don't move
Why won't I move
Why do I pretend
We're made of everyone else
I see you in my room
I think of your friend
The ordinary chokes me
When no one cares
Empty men
You're so useless
Choking under covers
Stifled like a dead man
Happy with the empty men
In a small room
Lash my face with glass
Era away from the animals
Still no closer
Cursing my fingers like ribbon
Like an animal swelling in sickness
Sallow child, frustration and hatred
Cutting my hair
Like cutting life with clean hands
Touching me
A brother lies in shapes of angels
Keep her away from my face
Series
Pictures of madmen color the walls
It's all a waste of time
Everything jumps once
And I fall into the walls
Covered like a madman choking
Choking like an empty man
Swaying out of time to be real again
I think I should finish soon
I think I should end
Magic and dreams and the end of the world
Choking on the covers
That stifle a dead man
Happy empty man
Sit in a small room
Lash my face and the animals sing
Please don't speak in the hanging garden
Every night in the hanging garden
The animals drip in the hanging garden
The animals drip at the side of the road
The animals drip at the side of the road
In the hanging garden
In the hanging garden




 I kneel and wait in silence
As one by one the people slip away
Into the night
The quiet and empty bodies
Kiss the ground before they pray
Kiss the ground
And slip away
I sit and listen dreamlessly
A promise of salvation makes me stay
Then look at your face
And feel my heart pushed in
As all around the children play
The games they tired of yesterday
They play

I stand and hear my voice
Cry out
A wordless scream at ancient power
It breaks against stone
I softly leave you crying
I cannot hold what you devour
The sacrifice of penance
In the holy hour

 All the things we never know we need

Looks like we get them in the end
Measure time in leisure time and greed
And by the time we get to spend
A floating bed
A head of stone
A home plugged into every phone
Kimono coral floral print
Exclusive tint and cut reclusive
No it doesn't come for free
But it's the price
We pay for happiness
No don't talk about more to life than this
Dream a world maybe no one owns
No don't think about all the life we miss
Swallow doubt as the hunger grows
Make believe its like no one knows
Even if we turn more to most
We'll never satisfy the hungry ghost
All the stuff we know we never want
Seems like we get it anyway
Safe to say it isn't really wrong
Not when we know we only
Throw it all away
Yeah all of this we never know we want
Its like we get it anyway
Safe to say it isn't ever wrong
Better to get than to delay
A 3d screen
A cleaner fit
A bit pulled out of every hit
Addicted latest greatest piece
Design caprice and make the headline
No it doesn't come for free
But it's the price
We pay for happiness
No don't talk about more to life than this
Dream a world maybe no one owns
No don't think about all the life we miss
Swallow doubt as the hunger grows
Make believe its like no one knows
Even if we turn more to most
We'll never satisfy the hungry ghost
And all of this
We know we never need

Well it's the price
We pay for happiness

 Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Your tongue is like poison
So swollen it fills up my mouth
Love me, love me, love me
You nail me to the floor
And push my guts all inside-out
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Get your fucking voice
Out of my head

I never wanted this!
I never wanted any of this!
I wish you were dead!
I wish you were dead!




 




 Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me...
Your tongue is like poison...
So swollen, it fills up my mouth...
Love me, love me, love me...
You nail me to the floor...
And push my guts all inside out...
Get it out, get it out, get it out...
Get your fucking voice, out of my head...
I never wanted this...
I never wanted any of this...
I wish you were dead (x2)
I never wanted any of this...
I wish you were dead (x2)




 Nothing I am, nothing I dream
Nothing is new
Nothing I think or believe in or say
Nothing is true

It used to be so easy
I never even tried
Yeah, it used to be so easy

But the last day of summer
Never felt so cold
The last day of summer
Never felt so old

All that I have, all that I hold
All that is wrong
All that I feel for or trust in or love
All that is gone




 Side by side in silence
They pass away the day
So comfortable, so habitual
And so nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
Side by side in silence
His thoughts echo round
He looks up at the sky
She looks down at the ground
Side by side in silence
They wish for different worlds
She dreams him as a boy
And he loves her as a girl
Loves her as a girl
And side by side in silence
Without a single word
It's the loudest sound
It's the loudest sound I ever heard




 We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk
The way we talk
The way we stalk
The way we kiss
We slip through the streets
While everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker
And wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and
Throw all the songs we know

Into the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We're so wonderfully wonderfully wonderfully
Wonderfully pretty
Oh you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea huh?
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up by the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream
Into the sea
You and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring
It's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We should have each other to dinner
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up by the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream

Hand in hand
Is the only way to land
And always the right way round
Not broken in pieces
Like hated little meeces
How could we miss
Someone as dumb as this

I love you ... let's go
Oh ... solid gold
How could we miss someone as dumb
As this?

 Oh I love, oh I love, oh I love
What you do to my head
When you pull me upstairs
And you push me to bed
I love what you do to my head
It's a mess out there!
Oh I love, oh I love, oh I love
What you do to my heart
When you push me back down
And then pull me apart
I love what you do to my heart
It's the best, oh yeah
Oh I love, oh I love, oh I love
What you do to my lips
When you suck me inside
And you blow me a kiss

Oh I love, love, love, love
What you do to my hips
When you blow me outside
And then suck me like this
I love what you do to my hips
It's the best, oh yeah

You're the only one I cry for
The only one I try to please
You're the only one I sigh for
The only one I die to squeeze
And it gets better everyday, I play
With you it's such a scream
Yeah it gets better everyday, I say
With you it's so extreme
Yeah it gets wetter everyday, I stay
With you it's like a dream

Oh I love, oh I love, oh I love
What you do to my skin
Please slip me on
And slide me in
I love what you do to my skin
It's a passion oh yeah

And you push me to bed
Oh, I love what you do to my head
It's a mess up there
Oh, I love, oh, I love
Oh, I love what you do to my heart
When you push me back down
And then pull me apart
Oh, I love what you do to my heart
It's the best, oh yeah
Oh, I love, oh, I love
Oh, I love what you do to my lips
When you suck me inside
And you blow me a kiss
Oh, I love what you do to my lips
It's so sweet in there
Oh, I love
What you do to my hips
When you blow me outside
And then suck me like this
Oh, I love what you do to my hips
It's the beat, oh yeah
You're the only one I cry for
The only one I try to please
You're the only one I sigh for
The only one I die to squeeze
And it gets better every day I play
With you it's such a scream
Yeah, it gets meta every day I say
With you it's so extreme
Yeah, it gets wetter every day I stay
With you it's like a dream
Oh, I love, oh, I love
Oh, I love what you do to my skin
When you slip me on
And slide me in
Oh, I love what you do to my skin
It's a blush in there
Oh, I love
What you do to my bones
When you slide me off
And slip me home
I love what you do to my bones
It's the crush, oh yeah
You're the only one I cry for
The only one I try to please
You're the only one I sigh for
The only one I die to squeeze
And it gets hazier every way I sway
With you it's such a scream
Yeah, it gets mazier every play I say
With you it's so extreme
Yeah, it gets crazier every day I stay
With you it's like a dream
Oh, I love, oh I love
Oh, I love what you do to me




 Oh, I love, oh, I love
Oh, I love what you do to my head
When you pull me upstairs
And you push me to bed
Oh, I love what you do to my head

 You and me are the world, she said
Nothing else is real
The two of us is all there is
The rest is just a dream

Always meant to be, I can feel it
Like a destiny thing written in the stars
Inescapable fate, yeah, it's out of my hands
Falling into your arms
And I don't want to get innocent
But I would love you to take my time
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing, she said
Come on, let's stay here for awhile

Ooh girl, he is the one for sure
Ooh girl, he is the perfect boy

Yeah, me and you are a world, he said
But not the only one I need
The two of us is never all there is
That doesn't happen for real

If it was meant to be us, it was meant to be now
Don't see the sense in wasting time
If you're so sure about this
(Long kismet hearty thing)
You know tonight you're mine
And I don't want to get obvious
But I have to be gone by three
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing, he said
So come on, jump with me

Ooh girl, he's not the one for sure
Ooh girl, he's not so wonderful
Ooh girl, he's not the one for sure
Ooh girl, he's not the perfect boy at all


And her heart may be broken a hundred times
But the hurt will never destroy
Her hope, the happy ever after girl
One day finds the perfect boy




 "You and me are the world", she said
"Nothing else is real
The two of us is all there is
The rest is just a dream
Always meant to be, I can feel it
Like a destiny thing written in the stars

Falling into your arms"
"And I don't want to get innocent

Oh, girl
He is the one for sure
Oh, girl
He is the perfect boy
"Yeah, me and you are a world", he said
"But not the only one I need
The two of us is never all there is
That doesn't happen for real
If it was meant to be us, it was meant to be now
Don't see the sense in wasting time
If you're so sure about this Laurel Kismet Hardy thing
You know tonight you're mine"
"And I don't want to get obvious
But I have to be gone by three
We're on the edge of a beautiful thing", he said
"So come on, jump with me"
Oh, girl
He's not the one for sure
Oh, girl

 You're such a strange girl
I think you come from another world
You're such a strange girl
I really don't understand a word
You're such a strange girl
I'd like to shake you around and around
You're such a strange girl
I'd like
To turn you
All upside down
You're such a
Strange girl
The way you look like you do
You're such a strange girl
I want
To be with you

I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling in
I think I'm falling in love with you
With you




 




 How time will heal? Make me forget, you promised me
Time will heal, make me forget, you promised me
Love will save us all, and time will heal, you promised me
You promised me, you promised me
How love will save? Make me forget, you promised me
Love will save, make me forget, you promised me
Time will heal us all, and love will save, you promised me
I trusted you, I wanted your words
Believed in you, I needed your words
Time will heal, make me forget
And love, love will save us all

You promised me another wish, another way
You promised me another dream, another day
You promised me another time, you promised me another life
You promised me

So I swallowed the shame and I waited, buried the blame and I waited
Choked back years of memories, I pushed down the pain, I waited
Trying to forget

You promised me another wish, another way
You promised me another dream, another day
You promised me another time, you promised me another lie
You promised me

Here I waited, and I waited, and I waited
And I waited, and I waited, and I waited
And I'm still waiting




 You've got what I want

Oh yeah!
It's only for the night
And I will give it back tomorrow I swear
She can barely breathe
Don't stare
I know the dress is tight
But it was all I had to wear
Give me what I need
Please share
You know it's only right
And I would never lie to you
I wouldn't dare

I made a promise to myself
I wouldn't start with anyone else but
You know how it is with these promises
Made in the heat of the moment

They're made to be broken in two
Sometimes the only thing to do

Oh no!
It's all coming back
How I came to in a sticky three-day hole
Didn't see the sign
Go slow
Too busy tuning static on the radio
She hissed it in a song
Don't go
It always fades to black
But that's why I love the trip
It's so inevitable


They're made to be less than they seem
Whenever you've got what I need

And you've got what I need
Aaaiiieee!
For service with a smile
I have to walk in on my hands
And roll for free
You say it's all the same
Ennui
You're not the real snow white
The real snow white is on my knee
I didn't need to get id
It's simply minimum height
And getting all dressed up
In seven ways to please


They're made to be broken one day
If there's no time to get away

Uh-oh!
She wasn't made to shine
She was really only ever made to glow
I left her in the dark
No show
Quiet sucking on a line
It was a tricky gun to load
And I didn't get to fire
Hi-ho!
She's off to work for time
I should have finished out with higher
Up than low

They're made before right becomes wrong
Whenever you've got what I want

And you've got what I want
Oh yeah!
It's only for the night
And I will give it back tomorrow
I swear




 I won't try to bring you down about my suicide
Got no need to understand about my big surprise
Oh I am falling through the sky
You remember this?
I am falling in their eyes
You remember the kiss?

I won't try to bring you down about my suicide
Got no need to understand about my big surprise
I won't beg to hang you up about my love of life
If you promise not to sing about the reasons why

I am writing you a letter
Getting better
Can I see you?
When...
All the lights go out together
Blame the weather
Yeah the cold again
In the darkness for a second
I am sure I see them smiling then
I feel them calling me
Yeah they are calling me

And I am falling through the stars
You remember now?
Yeah I am falling in their arms
You remember how?
Oh I am falling through the sky
You remember this ?
I am falling in their eyes
You remember the kiss?


I am calling you at midnight
Feeling alright...can I tell you?
When?
On the line no sound but my words
Must be night birds on the wire again
In the silence for a second
I am sure I hear them laughing then
I feel them calling me
Yeah they are calling me


"We know"
They said
"You're holding on
To nothing left of something gone
We know
They said
In letting go
Of fear and dread
And all you know
You'll lose the need of certainty
And make-believe eternity
To find the true reality
In beautiful infinity

But I won't try to bring you down about my suicide
If you promise not to sing about the reasons why




 Remember the first time I told you, I love you
It was raining hard and you never heard
You sneezed and I had to say it over
I said, "I love you I said", you didn't say a word
Just held your hands to my shining eyes
And I watched as the rain ran through your fingers
Held your hands to my shining eyes and smiled as you kissed me
"If you die", you said, "So do I", you said
And it starts the day you make the sign
Say I'll always be yours and you'll always be mine, you'll always be mine
"If you die", you said, "So do I", you said
And it starts the day you cross that line
Tell me I'll always be yours and you'll always be mine
You'll always be mine, you'll always be mine
Remember the last time I told you, I love you
It was warm and safe in our perfect world
You yawned and I had to say it over
I said, "I love you I said", you didn't say a word
Just held your hands to your shining eyes
And I watched as the tears ran through your fingers
Held your hands to your shining eyes and cried
"If you die", you said, "So do I", you said
But it ends the day you see how it is
There is no always forever, just this, just this
"If you die", you said, "So do I", you said
But it ends the day you understand
There is no if, just and
There is no if




 Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
Can't you see I try
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
'The shallow drowned lose less than we,' you breathe
The strangest twist upon your lips
And we shall be together
And we shall be together
Kiss me goodbye, bow your head, and join with me
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear, the ripples clear
And softly breaks against your feet
Softly breaks the mirror sweet
So we shall be together
So we shall be together
Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now, and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see, and I don't feel
But softly hold up silently
My hands, before my fading eyes
And in my eyes your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
I will kiss you, I will kiss you
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I will kiss you, I will kiss you
And we shall be together




 Kiss me goodbye
Pushing out before I sleep
Can't you see I try?
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
"The shallow drowned lose less than we" you breathe
The strangest twist upon your lips
"And we shall be together"
"Kiss me goodbye
Bow your head and join with me"
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear, the ripples clear
And laughing break against your feet
And laughing break the mirror sweet
"So we shall be together"
"Kiss me goodbye"
Pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see and I don't feel
But tightly hold up silently
My hands before my fading eyes
And in my eyes, your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
I will kiss you
I will kiss you
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I will kiss you
I will kiss you
And we shall be together

 Yeah I've been this way before
But something down here changed
The spring sun hanging slower
Colder in the sky
And your voice sounds strange
Your voice sounds strange
Yeah I've been down here before
But this time
Something really isn't right
Summer sun hangs smaller
Paler in the sky
And your eyes are too bright
Your eyes are too bright
It's like everything I know
Is twisted out and wrong
The fall sun hanging flatter
Lower in the sky
And your smile is gone
Your smile is gone
It's like twisted out I know
Now I can't wake to
Break apart this dream
Winter sun hangs weaker
Older in the sky
And you start to scream
You start to scream
Scream and you scream
This is not a dream
This is how it really is
There isn't any other this
Is not a dream
Scream and you scream
Why you have this need
Why you can't be satisfied
Always want another why
You have this need

Scream and you scream
Dare me to believe
Dare me now to show I care
One last chance to make the dare
Me to believe
Scream and you scream
How we ended here
How we got from then to now
Never really followed how
We ended here




 Well, we're a mile under the ground
And I'm thinking that it's Christmas
And I'm kissing you hard
Like I've got very important business
And no-one knows
And no-one sees us
Because they're drinking themselves senseless

And I'm writhing
And I'm writhing in the snake-pit

Well I'm out in a car
And it's just full of stupid girls
And I've forgotten how to speak
And I just can't remember a word
And my eyes feel like they're bursting
And they're splitting like plums

 I don't care
If only I could say that
And not feel so sick and scared
I don't care
If only I could say that
If only my eyes would close
It's jesus brilliant
You used to laugh
Walking these gorgeous blocks
This top is the place
Where nobody goes
You just imagine
You just imagine it all
Every day I lie here
And know that it's true
All I really want is you
Please come back
Like all the other ones do

Please come back
All of you




 "I don't care"
If only I could say that

 I love it, all these games we play
I close my eyes, you run away
I'm sure I asked you to stay
But now you're gone
Today I feel a grey pulse in my head
I turn off the lights and crawl into bed
I try to think of sunshine
But my body goes wet
With the first crash of thunder

I don't think I could love
Anyone but you
That's for sure

And when it gets to Fall
It's my turn to go
Oh, the kiss, so alcoholic and slow
Arranged a meet for Saturday
I thought you would know
That I always sleep alone

I don't think I could love
Anyone but you, dear
That's for sure 

The upstairs room is cool and bright
We could go up there in Summer
And dance all night
Your sister started talking at a minute after ten
'Til everyone jumped up
And then fell over again
In April you can join them
And stare at me
At the ghost from your past 

I don't think I could love
Anyone but you, dear
That's for sure 




 I called you after midnight
Then ran until I burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door

We walked around the lake
And woke up in the rain
And everyone turned over
Troubled in their dreams again
Visiting time is over
And so we walk away
And both play dead then cry out loud
Why we always cry this way?

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look
Like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything
Everything, everything, everything

I called you after midnight

 This
Here and now
With you

Oh please don't ask me who i am
Or when and where my life began
Or why i ended up like this or how
Don't ask me what i was before
If i was anything at all
Its nothing you can know
About me now
You hold my spinning head to stare
And strip me bare of memory
Your black eyes burning into me
So slow
The sounds and lights and others fade
And fall away in symmetry
Your black eyes burning hungrily
And unafraid i know

Everything i ever dared forget is here
Too scared before i never let
Tonight be all i need
Everywhere i never tried to get is here
Too tired before to ever let
Tonight be all i feel
Every time i ever thought regret is here
Too caught before i never let
Tonight be all i dream
There isn't any yesterday
Tomorrow starts a day away


I can't believe this is coming true
I'm up so close to kissing you
A breathe away from never going home
I don't remember getting here
It seems to be sometime next year
I hope you won't be
Leaving me alone?
No please don't tell me who I am
Or when and where my life began
Or why i ended up like this or how
Don't ask me what i was before
If i was anything at all
Its nothing you can know
About me now
You pull my shaking body close
To make the most of tangency
I bite your mouth so fearfully
And slow
The taste of summers yet to shine
A perfect time to change the scene
I bite your mouth in urgency
And terrified i know


This here and now with you is how
Always should always be




 How each of us decides
I've never been sure
The part we play
The way we are
How each of us denies any other way in the world
Why each of us must choose
I've never understood
One special friend
One true love
Why each of us must lose everyone else in the world

However unsure
However unwise
Day after day play out our lives
However confused
Pretending to know to the end

But this isn't truth this isn't right
This isn't love this isn't life this isn't real
This is a lie

How each of us believes
I've never really known
In heaven unseen and hell unknown
How each of us dreams to understand anything at all
Why each of us decides
I've never been sure
The part we take
The way we are
Why each of us denies every other way in the world

 Nothing left to feel
Nothing more to do
Nothing left to give
Nothing more in you
Nothing else to have or hold
Nothing left, but time to go
Time to go
Years go by
Didn't really say that much at all
And moments just fly
Didn't ever really touch at all
Weeks always run down
Didn't really get that close at all
And days, days fall out
Didn't ever really know at all
And then we're here in a room too clean and too bright
She stares at you for an hour
You stare into the light
For one last hour in the room
So mean and so white
I stare at her in this room as she stares into the night
Nothing left to feel
Nothing more to do
Nothing left to ask
Nothing more of you
Nothing else to share or show
Nothing left but time to go
In his eyes as we turn no eternity of life
In his eyes as we turn no infinity of why
In his eyes as we turn no beautiful goodbye
In his eyes as we turn...nothing but tears
In his eyes as we turn...nothing but tears
(spoken:) I couldn't understand too much of what was being said
In a matter of minutes
Peacefully so slow
I had to think to breathe
My heart burst
We moved in silence really slowly away from the world
As we drove a strange silence
That moment
Nothing will ever be the same
Nothing will ever be the same
Nothing will ever be the same
Days fall out
Weeks always run down
Moments just fly
Weeks go by
And then we're here
And then we're here in a room too clean and too bright
I stare at you for an hour
You stare into the light
For one last hour in the room so mean and so white
You stare at me in this room as I stare into the night
Nothing left to feel
Nothing more to do
Nothing more to take
Nothing more from you
Nothing else to need or know
There's nothing left at all...but time to go




 I lift my lips from kissing you
To kiss the sky, cloud soft and blue
And slow the sun melts down into
Your golden words for me
I lift my hands from touching you
To touch the wind that whispers through
This twilight garden turns into
A world where dreams are real
No one will ever take your place
I am lost in you
No one will ever take your place
So in love with you
I lift my eyes from watching you
To watch the star rise shine onto
Your dreaming face and dreaming smile
You're dreaming worlds for me
No one will ever take your place
I am lost in you
No one will ever take your place
So in love with you
I lift my lips from kissing you
And kiss the sky wide deepest blue
And slow the moon swims up into
Your golden words for me
No one will ever take your place
I am lost in you
No one will ever take your place
So in love with you
No one will ever take your place
I am lost in you
No one will ever take your place




 Enough of that
"Stand up straight!"
What nonsense
And I scream




 Enough of that
"Stand up straight!"
What nonsense
And I scream




 Walk across the garden
In the footsteps of my shadow
See the lights out
No one's home
In amongst the statues
Stare at nothing in
The garden moves
Can you help me?

Close my eyes
And hold so tightly
Scared of what the morning brings
Waiting for tomorrow
Never comes
Deep inside
The empty feeling
All the night time leaves me
Three imaginary boys

Slipping through the door
Hear my heart beats in the hallway
Echoes
Round and round
Inside my head
Drifting up the stairs
I see the steps behind me
Disappearing
Can you help me?

Close my eyes
And hold so tightly
Scared of what the morning brings
Waiting for tomorrow
Never comes
Deep inside
The empty feeling
All the night time leaves me
Three imaginary boys sing in my
Sleep sweet child
The moon will change your mind

See the cracked reflection
Standing still
Before the bedroom mirror
Over my shoulder
But no one's there
Whispers in the silence
Pressing close behind me
Pressing close behind
Can you help me?

 It's funny how your face gets bigger
Bigger in this atmosphere
And your mouth goes dry
With every move you try
It's so funny here
Jumping around
Click, click, click
When you're so slow
It's like the world is stopping
Fifteen times, I've tried this
And every time, I faint
You look at me and start to tell the joke
About the man who couldn't stop
Hiccuping
It would be so perfect
If you would just fall out the window
I would throw your foot away
You're tired and your face is grey
Like the sad old fool
You groove
Hey, hey, hey

 I'm in the room without a light
A room without a view
I'm here for one more treacherous night
Another night with you

It tortures me to move my hands
To try to move at all
And pulled
My skin so tight it screams
And screams and screams
And pulls some more

Hanging like this
Like a vampire bat
Hanging like this
Hanging on your back
I'm helpless again
Oh, I'm helpless again

My body is cut and broken
It's shattered and sore
My body is cut wide open
I can't stand anymore

It tortures me to move my hands
To try to move at all
And pulled
My skin so tight it screams
And screams and screams
And screams some more

Hanging like this
Like a vampire bat
Hanging like this
Hanging on your back

Oh, it's torture
And I'm almost there
It's torture, oh
And I'm almost there
It's torture, oh, ho-ho
It's torture, oh, ho-ho
It's torture, oh, ho-ho
It's torture, oh, ho-ho
But I'm almost there

 One perfect morning I was all alone
Listening to the blaze of summer
Drifting, I was falling, I was floating in a golden haze
Breathing in the sky blue sounds of memories of other days
And in my dreams I was a child
Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes
And I was floating through the colours of a sky
Up to the stars and angels
Up, up, up to heaven
Up, up, up forever
Up, up, up to heaven
Up, up, up forever
Turning in my climb I looked down on a lake
And traced upon the water there I saw your face
And sang in recollection of the times we shared
Then pushed on ever upward to the sky
And in my dreams I was a child
Flowers in my mouth and in my eyes
And I was floating through the colours of a sky
Up to the stars and angels
Up, up, up to heaven
Up, up, up forever
Up, up, up to heaven
Up, up, up forever

 Remember how it used to be
When the sun would fill the sky
Remember how we used to feel
Those days would never end
Remember how it used to be
When the stars would fill the sky
Remember how we used to dream
Those nights would never end

It was the sweetness of your skin
It was the hope of all we might have been
That filled me with the hope to wish impossible things
To wish impossible things

But now the sun shines cold
And all the sky is gray
The stars are dimmed by clouds and tears
And all I wish is gone away




 Drowning like a fly in my drink
You drone about being on the brink
But I really don't care what you think
Oh I'm sick of it all
Sick of it all
I hate the way it's always the same
Hate recrimination and blame
And you just wait for me to fuck up again
Oh I'm sick of it all
Sick of it all

The ways you try and put me down
Sweet revenge for the things I've done
The ways you try and twist me around
"give me a taste of my own medicine"

Drowning like a fly in my drink
You whine about being out of synch
But I really don't care what you think
Oh I'm sick of it all
Sick of it all
I hate the way you want me to be
Hate regret and humility
And you just wait for me to fall at your feet
Oh I'm sick of it all
Sick of it all


Any love you once felt for me
Has turned into this travesty
Of selfishness and jealousy
So why can't you just let me go?
Any love you once felt for me
Has turned into this travesty
Of selfishness and jealousy
So why can't I just let you go?




 She whispers
Please remember me
When I am gone from here
She whispers
Please remember me
But not with tears

Remember I was always true
Remember that I always tried
Remember I loved only you
Remember me and smile
For it's better to forget
Than to remember me
And cry




 There is no one left in the world
That I can hold onto
There is really no one left at all
There is only you
And if you leave me now
You leave all that we were undone
There is really no one left
You are the only one

And still the hardest part for you
To put your trust in me
I love you more than I can say
Why won't you just believe?

 I've been waiting for the lies to end
Holding for the bad to go
I've been hanging for the ugliness to change
Waiting for a world too true
Holding for a world too good
Hanging for a world too beautiful
Wishing for a girl too true
Hoping for a girl too good
Hungry for a girl too beautiful
'All I say is a lie,' she sighs
Nothing I say is true
'And all I do is bad,' she cries
Nothing I do is good
And yeah all I am is ugly
Nothing I am is beautiful at all
Don't get this world
I don't get this girl
So look, but you won't see it
Listen, and you won't hear it
Reach out, and you won't hold it
You can't know it, but you can free it
You can't name it, but could feel it
I've been waiting for the lies to end
Holding for the bad to go
I've been hanging for the ugliness to change
Waiting for a world too true
Holding for a world too good
Hanging for a world too beautiful
Wishing for a girl...like you
Hoping for a girl...like you
Hungry for a girl...like you
No...not like you...you




 Floating here like this with you
Underneath the stars aligned
For 13 billion years the view it's beautiful
And ours alone tonight underneath the stars

Spinning round and round with you
Watching shadows melt the light
So shining from our eyes a tear
Another space is ours alone tonight
Watch as shadows melt

The waves break

Whisper in my ear a wish
We could drift away so far
Your voice inside of my head like this it's infinite
The hours alone tonight, we could drift away


Everything gone ... still to
Together as now forever as one
In each other's arms so near and so far
Together as now underneath the stars

As the waves break




 Floating here like this with you
Underneath the stars
Alight for 13 billion years
The view is beautiful
And ours alone tonight
Underneath the stars
Spinning round and round with you
Watching shadows melt the light
Soft shining from our eyes
Into another space
Is ours alone tonight
Watching shadows melt
And the waves break
And the waves break
Whisper in my ear a wish
"We could drift away"
Held tight, your voice inside my head
The kiss is infinite
And ours alone tonight
"We could drift away"
Flying here like this with you
Underneath the stars
Alight for 13 billion years
The view is beautiful
And ours alone tonight
Underneath the stars
Underneath the stars
And everything gone
And all still to come
As nothing to us
Together as one
In each others' arms
So near and so far
Forever as now
Underneath the stars
As the waves break

 There is no terror in my heart
Death is with us all
We suck him down with our first breath
And spit him out as we fall
There is no terror in my heart
No dread of the unknown
Desire for paradise to be
Shall we love this on our own

No I don't want you anywhere near me
Get your fucking world out of my head

I don't want your "Us or them"
No I don't need your "Us or them"
Oh I don't want your "Us or them"
I don't need your "Us or them"
You're "Us or them"

I live in knowledge of real truth
And all my Gods are great!
The doleful can't of a bigot
Blinded by fear and hate
You live in knowledge of real truth?
Oh the biggest lie I heard
How sick in your mind and your soul
To be scared of my voice and my words

You don't want me anywhere near you
Get my fucking head out of your world

I don't want your "Us or them"
No I don't need your "Us or them"
Oh I don't want your "Us or them"
I don't need your "Us or them"
As the only way this ever ends is "Me"

 The holy city breathed
Like a dying man
It moved with hopeful tears
With the tears of the blind

And on and on as the night drew in
Through broken streets
That sucked me in
My feet were bare and cut with stones
With walking to the promised land

I pushed through crowds
Through seas of prayer
Through twisting hands and choking air
A vulture at the wailing wall
I circled
Waiting

 Tonight I'll dream
A girl called Home
And wake up in tears
All on my one
With the sun coming up
And my head against stone
Balcony dressed and drawn
Tonight I'll dream
A room so far away
Frost pale blue the colour
Of a perfect day
And then screw up my face
In the mirror as I wait
For the others to call
But if I don't believe in magic
And I don't believe in blood
And I don't believe in miracles
And I don't believe in love
Then how come I believe so soon
In a cherry tree girl
And a dust blue room?
Tonight I'll dream an hour
So long
Shadow soft smiles
And everyone loves me
To open my eyes
In a drag myself face undone
Hard back into the world
Tonight I'll dream
A dream I dream
Without even trying
I'm flying I scream
As I practise the move
I spit at my pillow
Stained face
And the others all come
But if I don't believe in magic
And I don't believe in blood
And I don't believe in miracles
And I don't believe in love
Then how come I believe it seems
In a girl called Home
And a world called dreams?




 I'm always wanting more
Anything I haven't got
Everything
I want it all
I just can't stop
Planning all my days away
But never finding ways to stay
Or ever feel enough today
Tomorrow must be more
Drink more dreams more bed more drugs
More lust more lies more head more love
More fear more fun more pain more flesh
More stars more smiles more fame more sex

But however hard I want
I know deep down inside
I'll never really get more hope
Or any more time
Any more time 

I want the sky to fall in
I want lightning and thunder
I want blood instead of rain
I want the world to make me wonder
I want to walk on water
Take a trip to the moon
Give me all this and give me it soon
More drink more dreams more drugs
More lust more lies more love




 Yeah, I've been watching me fall for it seems like years
Watching me grow small, I watch me disappear
Slipping on out my ordinary world, out my ordinary eyes
Yeah, slipping out the ordinary me into someone else's life
Into someone else's life

There's a thin, white, cold new moon
And the snow is coming down
And the neon bright Tokyo lights
Flicker through the crowd
I've been drifting around for hours, I'm lost and I'm tired
When a whisper in my ear insatiable breathes
"Why don't you follow me inside?"

Yeah, the room is small, the room is bright
Her hair is black, the bed is white
And the night is always young
Is always young, always young
The night is always young

Yeah, I've been seeing them strip
To the bone in the mirror on the wall
Seeing her swallow him whole
Like it's not me at all
She holds out her hands
And I follow her down to my knees
And the sucking inside insatiable smiles
You will forget yourself in me


And the night is always young
And the night is never over and over
And over and over and over
And then it's gone

Yeah, it's a cruel, mean, cold new day
And outside the snow is still coming down
And in the blood red Tokyo bed
I watch me coming 'round
She pulled him down for hours
Deeper than I've ever been
And as I fall in the mirror on the wall

I'm watching me scream

Yeah, I've been watching me go for it must be years
Watching me get slow, I watch me disappear
And one day, yeah, I know, I won't come back at all
And always over and over in his ordinary eyes

I'm watching me fall

 "You look like you could do with a friend", she said
"You look like you could use a hand
Someone to make you smile", she said
"Someone who can understand
Share your trouble, comfort you
Hold you close and I can do all of these
I think you need me here with you"
"You look like you could do with a sister", she said
"You look like you need a girl to call your own like
Fabulous, fabulous, call me fabulous"
And rubbing her hands so slow
"You stare at me all strange", she said
"Are you hungry for more?", "I've had enough", I said
"Please leave me alone, please go"

It doesn't touch me at all
It doesn't touch me, it doesn't touch me at all

"You know that you could do with a friend", she said
"You know that you could use a word
Like feel or follow or fuck", she said
And laughing away as she turned
"You're everything but no one like the last man on earth"
"And when I die", I said, "I'll leave you all"
Door closes, leaves me cold




 The world is neither fair nor unfair
The idea is just a way for us to understand
But the world is neither fair nor unfair
So one survives, the others die
And you always want a reason why

But the world is neither just nor unjust
It's just us trying to feel that there's some sense in it
No, the world is neither just nor unjust
And though going young, so much undone
Is a tragedy for everyone

It doesn't speak a plan or any secret thing
No unseen sign or untold truth in anything
But living on in others, in memories and dreams is not enough
You want everything
Another world where the sun always shines and the birds always sing
Always sing



It doesn't mean there has to be a way of things
No special sense that hidden hands are pulling strings
But living on in others, in memories and dreams
Is not enough and it never is
You always want so much more than this
An endless sense of soul and an eternity of love
A sweet mother down below and a just father above
For living on in others, in memories and dreams
Is not enough, you want everything
Another world where the birds always sing
Another world where the sun always shines
Another world where nothing ever dies




 I try so hard to be just for you
Careful what I want to know and what I do
Make my second nature all you ever see
You're sure it's the only way to be
Never go too far or ever stay too late
Worry what I think about and what I say
Make this second nature all I ever show
You're sure it's the only one to know
You're sure it's the only way to go
But why can't I
Why can't I believe?
Believe
Why can't I believe?
I don't want to break it down with you
Wondering if I ever did and never who
Take my second nature all you ever need
You're sure it's the only way to feel
Always run it back before I really should
Thin-lipped sorry every time to make it good
Take this second nature, all I ever play
You're sure it's the only one to stay
You're sure it's the only way...
But why can't I
Why can't I
Why can't I
Why can't I
Why
Why
Why can't I be me?
(Simply elegant...)




 You're so gorgeous I'll do anything
I'll kiss you from your feet to where your head begins
You're so perfect, you're so right as rain
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry again

Everything you do is irresistible
Everything you do is simply kissable
Why can't I be you?

I'll run around in circles until I run out of breath
I'll eat you all up or I'll just hug you to death
You're so wonderful, too good to be true
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry for you

Everything you do is simply delicate
Everything you do is quite angelicate
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?

You turn my head when you turn around
You turn the whole world upside down
I'm smitten, I'm bitten, I'm hooked, I'm cooked, I'm stuck like glue
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry for you

Everything you do is simply dreamy
Everything you do is quite delicious
So why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
You're simply elegant




 You're so gorgeous
I'll do anything
I'll kiss you from your feet
To where your head begins
You're so perfect
You're so right as rain
You make me make me make me
Make me hungry again
Everything you do is irresistible
Everything you do is simply kissable
Why can't I be you?
I'll run around in circles
'Til I run out of breath
I'll eat you all up
Or I'll just hug you to death
You're so wonderful
Too good to be true
You make me make me make me
Make me hungry for you
Everything you do is simply delicate
Everything you do is quite angelicate
Why can't I be you?
You turn my head when you turn around
You turn the whole world upside down
I'm smitten I'm bitten I'm hooked I'm cooked
I'm stuck like glue
You make me make me make me
Make me hungry for you
Everything you do is simply dreamy
Everything you do is quite delicious
So why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
You're simply elegant




 You're so gorgeous I'll do anything!
I'll kiss you from your feet
To where your head begins!
You're so perfect!
You're so right as rain!
You make me
Make me hungry again
Everything you do is irresistible
Everything you do is simply kissable
Why can't I be you?
I'll run around in circles
'Til I run out of breath
I'll eat you all up
Or I'll just hug you to death
You're so wonderful!
Too good to be true!
You make me

Make me hungry for you
Everything you do is simply dreamy
Everything you do is quite delicious
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
You're simply elegant!




 The soul lives forever
Always ends sometime
Now I'm alone, alone and cold
Under painted skies
Remembering the love that we came alive
And I can only scream
As a lonely cry
Forever
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it has never been
I lift my hand to wipe the tears
The tears
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away
Now my imaginary world is fading fast
Dreams I dreamed could never last
I lived my innocence in the past
And my broken heart
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it has never been
I lift my hand to wipe the tears
The tears
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away
The summer goes by upon the wind
Goes by as though it had never been
I lift my hand to wipe the tears
The tears
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone
I just can't go on
Now my love has gone away

 Anything at all, but you know I can't stop
It's life on the moon, all this talk of giving up
Life is too short, for it not to be true
The best idea I think, is for me to go my way
Anything at all, but don't want me to change
Hard to understand, when a plan is this strange
Life is too big, yeah, has to be true
The best idea I think, is for me to go my way
If all that you want, is how it could be
You may as well go now, there's no wait and see
Anything at all, but don't ask me to
You have to accept, I can't ever play safe
Life is too real, for it not to be true
The best idea I think, is for me to go my way
If all that you want, is how it could be
You may as well go, no, there's no wait and see
We'll always be wrong
If all I won't give, is all that you want
It's a strange way to live and let live
And all that you do, is measure me up, falling shorter than you
It's a strange way to love, and be as I want
Oh I know that you know, I can't fake, change, or stop
So anything at all, you know I won't choose
If all you could win, is all I would lose
When life is too right, yeah, has to be true
The best idea I think, is for me to go my way
(Whispered) Without you




 Let me take you on a trip
Around the world and back
And you won't have to move
You just sit still
Now let your mind do the walking
And let my body do the talking
Let me show you the world in my eyes
I'll take you to the highest mountain
To the depths of the deepest sea
And we won't need a map
Believe me
Now let my body do the moving
And let my hands do the soothing
Let me show you the world in my eyes
That's all there is
Nothing more than you can feel now
That's all there is
Let me put you on a ship
On a long, long trip
Your lips close to my lips
All the islands in the ocean
All the heaven's in motion
Let me show you the world in my eyes
That's all there is
Nothing more than you can touch now
That's all there is
Let me show you the world in my eyes




 Dressed in berlin black
I was only playing
Disguise my words to fool you
From what i was saying
Mud trench
Meat stench
The fatherland is looking on
Grip you in a luger lock
This will be the big one

World war
No one would believe me
No one's a winner
No one's a loser
Just a dead friend

Heaven heaven
Give me pride
Give me a golden hand
Smash them with an iron rule
Spit them out like sand
Sit and wait
Then run like hell
Run like hell one time again
Sow the seeds of hate
Underneath destruction


World war
No one would believe me
No one's a winner
No one's a loser
Just a dead friend
World war
No one would believe me
No one's a winner
No one's a loser




 Lime green lime green lime green and tangerine
Are the sickly sweet colours of the snakes I'm seeing
Lime green lime green and tangerine
Are the sickly sweet colours of the devil in my dreams
Lime green lime green lime green and tangerine
Are the sickly sweet colours of the snakes I'm seeing
Lime green lime green and tangerine
Are the sickly sweet colours of the devil in my dreams
It gets to friday and I give you a call
"You know I'm getting kind of worried
No she doesn't seem herself at all...
Lime green and a sickly kind of orange
I've never seen her like this before..."
I had the best laid plans this side of america
Started out in church and finished with angelica
Red and blue soul with a snow white smile
"Can you dig it?"
"Can you dig it?"
I had the best laid plans this side of america
Started out in church and finished with angelica
And now I dig it in the dirt
And I'm down here for a while...
And I'm down here for a while...
You've got to make up your mind and make it soon
Is there room in your life
For one more trip to the moon?
Is there room in your life
For one more?
Burn red burn red burn red burn red and gold
Are the deep dark colours of the snakes I hold
Burn red burn red burn red and gold
Are the deep dark colours of the devil at home
"She pulls me down just as I'm trying to hide
Grabs me by the hair and drags me outside
And starts digging in the dirt...
For a not so early bird it's the only way
For her to get the worm..."

"Hello? are you still there?"
"Hello? are you still there?"
And much too late
Sorry... wrong number
Sorry... wrong number

 They pulled in just behind the fridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee my life's a funny thing, am I still too young?"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone?"
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
"We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?"
All night
He wants the young American
Young American, young American, he wants the young American
All right
He wants the young American
Do you remember, your President Clinton?
Do you remember, Bill, you have to pay
Or even yesterday?
Have you have been an un-American?
Just you and your idol singing falsetto 'bout
Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression?
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheilas
Ain't that close to love?
Well, ain't that poster love?
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her heart's been broken just like you have
All night
You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
All right
You want the young American
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man you can say no more?
And, ain't there a woman I can sock on the jaw?
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging?
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die?
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces?
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
Break down and cry?
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young American

I always wanna be by your side
Girl, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin', now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me
You Really Got Me




 Your god is fear
That all you are
Is all there is
Your god is fear
And nothing more
Of all of this
Your god is fear
Been and gone
In the blink of an eye
Fear of ever breathing
Fear of ever leaving
Fear of ever changing
Forever, for now
Your god is fear
Your god is fear
Your god is fear
Your god is fear
That all you are
Is all there is
Your god is fear
Of nothing more
Than all of this
Your god is fear
Been and gone
In the blink of an eye
Fear of ever choosing it
Fear of ever losing it
Fear of ever playing
Forever, for now
Your god is fear
Your god is fear
Your god is fear
Just for a moment
Feel it inside
Feel it alive
Feel your desire
Feel it catch fire
Feel it inspire
How all you are
Is all there is
Nothing ever moves
In anything
Open your mind
Step out of time
Let yourself die
And your god is
Your god is
Your god...
