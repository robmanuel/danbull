 Born of the age
Flagged hopes
Censored rage
The black clad box
Bombs bursting in air
Bleed white red and blue
Cried dawn's early light
For the hope
Oh where has it gone
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July
Lie by the sword
Black times
False reward
The greetings of doom
So proudly they hail
Lost fortune of free
The stripes and bright stars
Promise lost
Oh where has it gone
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July




 Dut da da dut
(Dut da da da da da dut)

A casual look (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
A little wink (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
Can reveal (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
Just what you think (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
So don't be shy (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
Don't even cry (Dut da dut da dut)
For I am your guy
I am your guy
A soldier boy (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
When he proposed (Dut da da da da da dut da dut) (baby please)
She said "no" (Dut da da da da da dut da dut) (oh come on baby)
His face just froze (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
You know she loved him (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
But was so young (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
Can't marry no one (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
Oh darling can't you see
That I'm going overseas
For two, three, four years
Don't know how long it will be
So hear hear my plea
And come marry, marry me
Before it's too late
And so with a smile (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
We walked down the aisle (Dut da da da da da dut da dut)
She in her wedding dress (Dut da da da da da dut dut)
A vision of happiness (Dut da da da da da dut dut)
And just to think (Dut da da da da da dut dut)
All it took (Dut da da da da da dut dut)
Was a casual look (Dut da da da da da dut dut)




 Feel the wind burn through my skin
The pain, the air is killing me
For years my limbs stretched to the sky
A nest for birds to sit and sing
But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't bear the glow
They did so long ago
One day I was full of life
My sap was rich and I was strong
From seed to tree I grew so tall
Through wind and rain I could not fall
But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't offer
Poetry to men of song

Trees like me weren't meant to live
If all this world can give
Pollution and slow death
Oh Lord I lay me down
No life's left to be found
There's nothing left for me
Trees like me weren't meant to live
If all this earth can give
Is pollution
Trees like me weren't meant to live
(Oh Lord I lay me down)
If all this earth can give
(My branches to the ground)
Is pollution and slow death
(There's nothing left for me)
Oh Lord I lay me down
My branches to the ground
There's nothing left for me




 The sunday mornin' gospel goes good with the soul
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rollin' stone
The world could come together as one
If everybody under the sun
Add some music to your day
(Add some music add some add some music to your day)
A bob didit a bop didit
You'll hear it while you're walkin' by a neighbor's home
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone
You're sittin' in a dentist's chair
And they've got music for you there

 Over the city in an airplane
I can see everything below
The houses they look so tiny
The cars look like dots
We've only got fifteen minutes to go
The clouds in the sky caress my mind so tenderly
The sun shines down on the great big beautiful sea
The sound of the engine fills my ears up
I'm hoping this rainy weather clears up
My lover is waiting at the airport
Soon she'll be kissing me hello
The woman sitting next to me tells me 'bout her guy
And I tell her all about you and I
Airplane, airplane
Carry me back to her side
Airplane, airplane
I need God as my guide
Down, down on the ground
Can't wait to see her face

(a-1, a-2, a-1, 2, 3)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)




 If I could live my life again
I'd never do you wrong
You better know, oh
If I just had a chance again
To spend my life with you
You know, it's in my soul, oh
I'd be standin' by your side
Not to ever let you go
If I only had a chance to live a life that we belong
Would I be strong?
If I didn't take the time and never try to understand
Ooh, my love, where it's gone
In the sadness that our love is left behind
I'm standing all alone
If I could stand to love again
Plant another seed
You know, would it grow, oh
If I could share my life again
With all the love I have for you, my love
Would it grow? Where would it go?
Ooh, my love
Now it's gone
In the sadness that I love is left behind
I'm standing all alone
All alone




 Doot doot doot-doot doot

Well she first caught my eye a-running round in shorts
But she never bothered with her hair
Just a barefooted chick with skinned up knees
Yeah she didn't care what she'd wear
(All dressed up for school)

Dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on
All dressed up for school

All summer long she had a crush on me
But I just couldn't care at all
But new to school threads really did it for me
Yeah she's turned into a doll
(All dressed up for school)


Goes out every night because she's a sharp little doll
And the guys can't leave her alone
Now she hardly finds the time to talk to me
She's not the little girl I've always known
(All dressed up for school)




 Hey hey hey
Da da da
That's what I say
Da da da

There's a man in the funny papers we all know
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
He lived way back a long time ago
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Well he don't eat nothing but bearcat stew
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Oh well this cat's name is a-Alley Oop
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop

He's the toughest man there is alive
Alley Oop
Wears clothes from a wildcat's hide
Alley Oop
He's the king of the jungle jive
Look at that caveman go!

He's got a chauffeur that's a genuine dinosaur
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
And he can knuckle your head before you count to four
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
He's got a big ugly club and a headful of hair
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
He's oohhhh eating grizzly bear
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Forgot the words!


He rides through the jungle tearing limbs offa trees
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
And knocking great big monsters dead on their knees
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Other cats don't bug him because they know better
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Because he's a mean motor scooter and a bad go-getter
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop

Well, uh, he's the toughest man there is alive
Alley Oop
Wears clothes from a wildcat's hide
Alley Oop
He's a hully gully king of jive
Well look at that caveman go!

There he goes
(There he goes)
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Look at that caveman go
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Ride, daddy, ride
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Heigh-ho, dinosaur
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Oh my goodness, what a big brute he is! Hm!
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Oh, how would you like a dinosaur like that, for your own? Mm!
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop

(G minor. D7.)
(What now? What now?)
(Just give me a minute.)
(Brian, I need a B flat...You know I can't read.)




 All I want to do
Is always bring good to you
To give you all the love I can
And help you in whatever you do

Sure as the sun will come around again
To start off another day
You can be sure that in my heart and soul
I'll love you in every way


Oh, when I sit and close my eyes
A gentle thought comes in my mind
My love is burning brightly
My moon and stars shine nightly

All I want to do

Oh, let these little words of love
Come romance and light your way
My love is burning brightly
My moon and stars shine nightly


All I want to do
Do, do, do, do, do
My moon and stars shine brightly




 You haven't got time for diamonds
And you pay no mind to gold
You gave up everything you had
But there's one thing I want you to hold

Come let the power through you
Come on and let me thrill you
Mama now

(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
I just want to do it with you

Well I don't care where you want to go
Just so you go with me
And I don't care what you want to do
But make sure you do it with me
All I want to do with you
Well I just make-a some love to you

Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
I said baby
(Baby come on come on)
I just want to do it to you
All night lo-ong

Oooo

Daybreak and I take a glide
Into the pool of peace inside
(Two waves travel by)
To waves and I both travel by
(And that makes all the difference to me)
Life supporting waves of bliss
Mother Divine's precious kiss
Brings with love the light of wisdom
And the gift of eternal freedom
To waves and I both travel by
(... and the nature of man...)
And that makes all the difference to me
(Krishna...)


Dusk time the shadows fall
Into the timeless time of all
To waves and I both travel by
Golden auras glow around you
Omnipresent love surrounds you
Wisdom warming as the sun
You and I are truly one
To waves and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me

 Let's take your car and to amusement parks USA
At Palisades in Salisbury Parks the rolly coasters are flying
At Euclid Beach on the flying turns I'll bet you can't keep her smiling
Buy your girl a cotton candy while you're down on the ground
Then take her on the twirl-a-way and spin her around
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day
The parachutes at Riverview Park will shake us up all day
And Disneyland and P.O.P. is worth a trip to L.A
Watchin' girls in the air can really get you bad
And I'll bet the laughing lady makes you laugh like mad
Let's pick up our friends and do amusement parks USA
Hurry, hurry, hurry folks step right up to the Beach Boy circus. The best little show in town. Hurry, hurry, hurry, it's only a dime folks, one thin dime, just one tenth of a dollar. Come on in and see Stella the snake dancer (Is it real?) She walks, she talks, she wiggles on her belly like a reptile. (She looks like afake to me) (Let's go see her) (It costs too much) Hurry, hurry, hurry folks, come on and see Stella. She shimmies, she shakes
You'll crash and burn in the bumper cars at Jersey's steel pier
You'll crack them up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors
At first you'll be a chicken at the jackhammer ride
But you'll do it with a girl sittin' right by your side
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day




 You're so sleepy
Wish that he could stay
Love him so
But now it's getting late
He'll be waiting
Waiting just for you
One more summer
And your dream comes true

 Oo ooo ooo ooo ooo

Now the puzzle's laid out on my table
The pieces don't fit
I move from chair to chair
But that empty one's there where she used to sit
I'm sitting here going out of my mind
Cause she's gone away
She couldn't wait, now I
I'm afraid it's too late

I'm waiting till my angel comes home
It's been hell being here alone
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home
Angel, angel come home
If you see her tell my angel come home
Oo oo oo angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home

Does she remember
That I can't forget
Does she know I regret
I never told her how I
I wanted to hold her
I just let her go
Lonely nights thinking
It's starting to sink in
We had a way to go
We'll grow closer together
By being apart

When my angel comes home
It's been hell being here alone
God tell me, why has she flown
So far away
I pray she won't stay another day
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home
Please come home

Angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel come home
Hoo ooo angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Hey hey angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Ho oo angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Hey angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
If you see that girl my angel come home
Hey hey angel come home

And precious one
I'd feel good just to walk with you
Tonight will be a special treat
You're so sweet
And I feel good just to talk with you

And don't you know that there's so much more to come

And don't you know that there's so much more to come




 When I see my baby
When I see my little girl
When I see my woman
I'm gonna tell her about the lonely hours I just spent
And say the thing we got going hope it never ends
Well I'm gonna tell that little girl a thing or two

Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa
Outta sight baby
Ahhh-ha ha
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa

When I see my baby
When I look in her pretty eyes
When I get with my darling baby
I say my heart will start to beat like a couple of drums
She'll get my temperature to rise to 'bout a hundred and one


A whole day away from your woman
A separation from your girl can really mess your mind
And can you dig this one thing
Well it's lucky I'm working from nine to five
I have to live with my doctors just to keep me alive
Keep on telling a thing or two




 Birds fly up
And down spinning round
Flying all around
From my window
A little brown sparrow came
Fluttering down
"Le moineau est venu
Se poser à ma fenêtre"
He came to my window
And as I watched him
I found myself reeling and turning around
And the faster I ran
I ran out of breath and I fell to the ground
(Poof)

He came to my window

From their eyes
The people must look like miniature toys

Do do do do do
Fly away




 Should old acquaintance be forgot

 Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
Ah ah ah ah ahhhhh

Now a young man's gone
But his legend lingers on
For so much had he to give
But his life is through
For the story told is true
For he died just as he lived
For this daring young star
Met his death while in his car
No one knows the reason why
Screaming tire, flashing fire
And gone was this young star
Oh how could they let him die
Still a young man is gone
Yet his legend lingers on
For he died without a cause
And they say that he'll
Be known for evermore
As the Rebel Without A Cause




 Lie alone in bed at night
Feel the pull of a lonely day
Abstract music start to play
I wonder where you were today

(Baby blue)
Baby baby blue
Baby blue eyes I dream of you

Late at night
When the whole world's sleeping
I dream of you
Close to you I feel your sweet heart beating
I dream of you
Late at night late at night
Honey late at night I dream of you
I dream of you

Baby baby blue
Baby blue eyes I love you new
I hold you in my dreams tonight
Hold you until morning light

(Baby)
Baby baby blue
(Baby blue)
Baby blue eyes I dream of you
(Baby)
Baby baby blue
(Baby blue)
Baby blue eye I dream of you
(Baby)
Baby baby blue




 Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I'm going back this summer to Ohio
I'm going to seek out all my friends I've always known
I'm going back to that farm that I remember
Well, I'm going to spend this summer back home

Back home (back home, back home, back home)
I'll spend my summer (back home)
Back home (back home)

I'm going to get up every morning before the roosters
I'll run downstairs fix my breakfast all alone
I'll milk those cows feed the chickens and the horses
Well, I'm going to spend this summer back home


I'll eat everything that Ma puts on the table
When I get back you won't believe how I've grown
I'll hit the sack early every night thinking about tomorrow, whoa oh
Well, I'm going to spend this summer back home
Back home, back home, back home




 Betsy, Betsy, ahh

She was born in '32, and was she ever pretty
She rode a freight train west, all the way from Detroit city
Betsy's seen more places than I'll ever hope to see
Betsy's been more loyal than any friend could be
With some she traveled fast, with others it was slow
Betsy's seen them all, she'd seen them come and go
She must have had some others before I finally met her
And now that she's all mine, they'd better just forget her
Betsy was a lady and that she will remain
Betsy took some beatings but she never once complained
She had a classic beauty that everyone could see
I was the last to meet her, but she gave her life to me
She may be rusted iron, but to me she's solid gold
And I just can't hold the tears back
Cause Betsy's growing old




 Barbara gently smiling for me
Tender and warm
Shining with love
And I love you, I love you, love you
God I do
Oh I love the way you love me
Every day is a special day for me
Living with you
Just being with you
All my love, for all my life, my love, my love
Just for you
For I love to sing songs for you
Ah
I love you

 Barbie, Barbie, queen of the crew
Turned down dates with Eddie and Todd
Everyone loves her, she's lovely to see
But Barbie, my Barbie, she loves only me
Barbie, Barbie, still in her teens
Bell of the parties, a tom boy in jeans
She's everything that a girl wants to be
And Barbie, my Barbie, she loves only me
This is a year, we have prayed for
This is a moment sublime
All of our lives we have waited for
For this one perfect time
Barbie, Barbie, always I knew
Can come here for one moment with you
Everyone loves you and everyone knows
That Barbie, my Barbie, you love only me
You love only me
You love only me
You love only me

 Out in the barnyard, the chickens do their number
Out in the barnyard, the cook is choppin' lumber
Jump in the pigpen, next time I'll take my shoes off
Hit the dirt, do a two-and-a-half, next time I'll leave my hat on




 We got beaches in mind
Man it's been too much time

Woke me up before dawn
Wish I could sleep some more so I could carry on
With the dream I've been meaning to make come true
And that's to get away with you
I think we all can agree
That there's no better place for us to be
We can drive on for miles till we're finally free
It'll just be you and me


South bay surfing again
Haven't been this way in I don't know when
If I have my say we'll be back again
Where the good times never end
We got beaches in mind
Man, it's been too much time
Not a care in the world is where I want to be
With the surfers, sand and the sea
We'll find the place in the sun
Where everyone can have fun, fun fun




 It's been such a long day so you better hurry home
Lit all my incense and I wish you were home
Only five minutes and you walk through my door

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life full

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life

Stay here on the weekend and unplug the phone
(Alright then)
No calls from Korthoff, Parks, or Grillo
I only hope that you come here alone

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life full

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life
Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life




 Bells are ringing, soul of France
Bells are singing of romance

C'est tres jolie en Paris in the spring
Watching all the lovers walk along the Seine
Pitch a penny in her like a wishing well
Feed the pigeons in the park near Tour-Eifelle


There's a chapel "Sacre Coure" in quaint Montmarte
In the open air the painters show their art
In the restaurant sip a beaujolies
What a perfect way to spend a lovely day


Sunday morning, hear the bells of Notre Dame
Watching belles jeunes filles and the handsome gendarmes
Near the Arc De Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees
Coffee and croissants in a sidewalk cafe
Some people go to see the races at Deauville
Or weekend by the racing tides of Mont San Michelle
Some take the tour of Chartres on an autobus
While the writers and the artists never leave Mont Parnasse




 The bells of Christmas go ring-a-ling-ling
They toll for the savior and the peace he'll bring
And little children everywhere are caroling
'Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Bells are ringing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Children singing
The bells of Notre Dame cathedral will chime
And everywhere a princely peace
And there they light the candles up one at a time
For the ones they love at Christmastime
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Bells are ringing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Children singing
The omnipresent spirit of the world will sing
That Christ is born
Oh oh oh
And people of the world are all rejoicing
For the baby Jesus born in Nazarene
The bells of Christmas go ring-a-ling-ling
They toll for the savior and the peace he'll bring
And little Children everywhere are caroling
'Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Bells are ringing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Children singing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Bells are ringing
Oh oh oh oh
Bells of Christmas
Children singing
Ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah




 You know, you know you are
Be still and know you are

Your life is meant for joy
It's all so deep within, oh
Your life is beautiful
A seed becomes a tree
A mountain into a sky
This life is meant to be, oh
Now is the time, life begins
Take that simple path
And love will set you free
Live in harmony
And love will set you free, oh

 (Pied Piper)
(I'd better get back in bed)
(Hope I'll see you again)

Thirty seconds after he was in bed
He fell back to sleep
The next morning
He had forgotten all about
What had happened the night before
But when night time came once again
His thoughts somehow found their way back
To remembering the fascinating episode of the night before
He he turned out his bedroom light
And sat in his favourite chair
Thoughts danced in his head for a while
"Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there" he
Said "I wonder what would happen"




 You're going out tonight
You put your real cool looking clothes on
You're getting uptight
About some little thing I said

All that I said
"I couldn't play the game"
It shouldn't make any difference to you
Go walking around night
The wind's really blowing
It's too cold to talk
I wonder if she's knowing
She should be with me
It could set her free
Come with me
Be with me
A part of me

(Free)
Da da da da da da da da da da
(Free)
Da da da da da da da da da da

Everything we will see
Everything we will be
We will be
A new child is born
The mother is still waiting
Father's over there anticipating
Won't you be with me
It could set you (us) free
Come with me
Be with me
A part of me

 Do do do do do do do do do
Cashmere hills filled with evergreens
Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea
With the granite cliff
(big sur mount)
As a referee
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns
A mother deer with their newborn fawns
All under big sur skies
(big sur mount)
That's where i belong
Big sur i've got plans for you
Me and mine are going to
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers
(big sur mount)
And live in canyons covered in springtime green
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen
And with my old guitar
I'll make up songs to sing
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside
Join the big sur river to the oceanside
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide
Big sur my astrology it says that i am made to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water
And so while stars shine brightly from up above
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove
And to my dying fire i think i'll add a log
From time to time i must go away
The thoughts of big sur won't let me stay
Away from big sur
Oh big sur




 I found my thrill
On blueberry hill
On blueberry hill
When I found you

The moon stood still
(Moon stood still)
On blueberry hill
(Blueberry hill)
It lingered until
(Lingered until)
My dream came true

Though we're apart
(We're apart)
I think of you still
(Think of you still)
For you were my thrill
(You were my thrill)
On blueberry hill

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be




 Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
He looked into her eyes and said
Ooo wee baby you're so good for my head


Oh everyone in every land
Please give me a helping hand
If you see her all alone
Oh tell my baby "won't you please come home?"


Oh bring my baby back
I don't know why she's been so long
But all I know is that she's gone
Oh bring my baby back to me
Well I'm in pain can't you see
A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
I guess that's why we fell in love
And now she's gone and all I have to say is


Bring my baby
Oooo Baby
Oooo oooo oooo oooo




 I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurting

You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas




 Break break shake away
Break breakaway
Now I'm free to do what I want to do

Time will not wait for me
Time is my destiny
Why change the part of me that has to be free
The love that passed me by
I found no reason why
But now each day is filled with the love
That very same love
That passed me by
And that is why
I can breakaway from that lonely life
And I can do what I want to do
And breakaway from that empty life
And my world is new
When I laid down on my bed
I heard voices in my head
Telling me now "Hey it's only a dream"
The more I thought of it
I had been out of it
And here's the answer I found instead

(Baby baby)
Found out it was in my head

And I can breakaway to the better life
Where the shackles never hold me down
I'm going to make a way for each happy day
As my life turns around

Come on we're free to breakaway

 Teenage gamblers
Sitting in a Rambler
Listening to the radio
And then standing in the grandstand
Following the gameplan
Watching life's plays unfold
You fell in love with a pretty cheerleader
I even married one
And we once rode a cab out in Salt Lake City
Coming up with "Fun Fun Fun"
(Fun fun fun)

They say that Brian is back
Well I've known him for oh so long
They say Brian is back
Well I never knew that he was gone
Still they say "Brian is back"
I know he's had his ups and downs
Well they say "Brian is back"
But in my heart he's always been around

I still remember
They're sounding sweet and tender
Singing "Danny Boy" on Grandma's lap
And those harmony highs
Could bring tears to my eyes
I guess I'm just a sentimental sap
"Good Vibrations" caused such a sensation
Not to mention old Pet Sounds
And we travelled the world
As the banners unfurled
I guess you'd have to say we got around
(We got around we got around)


Ah ah ah ah ah ah




 Well, along with our special feature of this Beach Boys' Christmas Album
Once again I'm happy to see the smiling face of the leader of
This popular group here in the studio, Brian Wilson
Good to see you again, Brian
Hi, Jack
This Beach Boys' Christmas Album is really something
Ah, Dick Reynolds did the arrangements, I guess, huh?
Yes, he did. He did a beautiful job, a wonderful job
Is this the first time you've worked with him?
Right. I'd been, uh, wanting to meet him and work with him for quite a long time
Now who's idea was it to have you featured on this, uh, one particular tune--I
I was particularly impressed with it--"A Blue Christmas."
Well, I... sort of picked out that song to sing for myself
I, I love the song and uh, I've always wanted to sing it, so I thought I'd sing it
Well, maybe this will be the start of a whole new career, huh?
I don't know, that's... It, it could, and it couldn't. Ah... I really don't know
Well, let's leave it to the listeners to see what they think of it
Right
I notice this album has uh, ah, along with some of the popular things like, uh
"I'll Be Home For Christmas," uh, "Auld Lang Syne," and uh, um, "We Three Kings"
And some of the traditional things, that you have a couple of your
Your own, uh, Beach Boys type sounds in the LP, too
Uh-huh, we've more or less made one side, uh, our own style, and...
Kind of a teen side and an adult side
Uh-huh, right, um-hm. Contrasting
Uh-huh. Now, we have, uh, one of your originals coming up here, Brian
Uh, "Christmas Day." You wrote this for the album specifically?
Yes, I did. Uh-huh
Uh-huh. And now, do you do your, the vocal arrangements
Or did Dick Reynolds handle all of that?
Dick handled the vocal arrangements on the, ah, the modern side
--the traditional side--and I did the, ah, vocal and the
Arrangements of the music on our own style--our basic style--side
Dick did the strings, also, on the, uh, on the modern side
Coming up now, ah, a very sentimental type Christmas song
Particularly for those who are away from home during this time of year
--"I'll Be Home For Christmas." Any, ah, thing particular about this
This tune that you'd like to say, Brian?
Ah, well, I guess there's something very obvious when you hear the song
It's, ah, there's a very definite influence of the Four Freshmen
On the arrangement as well as the delivery, and, uh, obviously
We all look up and admire the style of the Four Freshmen and
Uh, I feel this has been the greatest--one of the greater--
Vocal influences, ah, in the world today
Well, it's certainly been, uh, nice of you to take the time to come
By again here for our special Beach Boys' Christmas show
You have a fine album here and, uh, I hope you'll be home for Christmas
Well, I hope I will, too. I hope everyone's home for Christmas
I do, too. Brian Wilson, thanks again for coming by
Thank you very much, Jack
And here again, the Beach Boys' Christmas Album

In my life
He sent us a telegram
Hey uh hey Carl
Yeah get out of here

Beautiful place I mean the Colosseum, I've never seen anything like that ever
Looks like it
When in Rome
You know I love England
The T. V. work is great there
If you notice like "Shindig" or"Halibalu" a lot of these T.V. shows are
Going after it

Or well all of the T. V. shows are all going after this sort of thing




 I had to fix a lot of things this morning
Because they were so scrambled
But now it's okay
I tell you I've got enough to do
The afternoon was filled up with phone calls
What a hot sticky day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The air is cooling down

Take all the time you need, it's a lovely night
If you decide to come, you're going to do it right
Drive for a couple miles, you see a sign and turn
Left for a couple blocks, next is mine you'll turn
Left on a little road, it's a bumpy one
You see a white fence, move the gate and drive
Through on the left side, come right in and you'll
Find me in my house somewhere
Keeping busy while I wait

I get a lot of thoughts in the morning
I write them all down
If it wasn't for that
I'd forget them in a while
And lately I've been thinking about a good friend
I'd like to see more of
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I'll make a call

I wrote a number down but I lost it
So I searched through my pocket book, I couldn't find it
So I sat and concentrated on the number and
Slowly it came to me so I dialed it
And I let it ring a few times, there was no answer

So I let it ring a little more, still no answer
So I hung up the telephone, got some paper and
Sharpened up a pencil and
Wrote a letter to my friend




 Light the lamp and fire mellow
Cabin essence timely hello
Welcomes the time for a change
Lost and found, you still remain there
You'll find a meadow filled with grain there
I'll give you a home on the range

Who ran the iron horse? 

I want to watch you windblown facing
Waves of wheat for your embracing
Folks sing a song of the grange
Nestle in a kiss below there
The constellations ebb and flow there
And witness our home on the range

Who ran the iron horse?

Have you seen the grand coolie working on the railroad? 

Over and over
The crow cries uncover the cornfield
Over and over
The thresher and hover the wheat field

 On my way to sunny California
On my way to spend another sunny day
Water, water get yourself in the cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
The sun shines brightly down on the bay
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away
Have you ever been south of Monterey
Barrancas carve the coast line and the chaparral flows to the sea
'Neath waves of golden sunshine
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay
The south coast plows the sea
And the people there are of the breed
They don't need electricity
Water, water, cool cascades of clear, clear water
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way
Have you ever been down Salinas way?
Where Steinbeck found the valley
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be
There the monarch's autumn journey ends
On a windswept cyprus tree
Water get water get yourself in that
Get yourself in that get yourself in that cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
Get yourself in that water
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away
Have you ever been to a festival, the Big Sur congregation?
Where Country Joe will do his show
And he'd sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air, one big family
Yeah the people there love to sing and share
Their new found liberty




 If everybody in the U.S.A
Could come with us to Californ-i-a
We could take them to a place out west
Where the good sun shines everyday
Now there's a touch of Californ-i-a
In everyone who's ever been this way
And when your telephone begins to ring
And the operator comes on the line

California calling
I'll be there right away
There's some beautiful women
Going to find me one
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave

Now I've joined the surfing nation and so
I'll take a permanent vacation and go
To the golden shores of 'Frisco Bay
I'll ride them all the way to Malibu
And I'll take you boogie boarding with me
Because when we're surfing it's so great to be free
And when you're on a California beach
You might even find them windsurfing too


In the fifties it was "Hey Daddy O"
Then came the surfers and the Hodads you know
We had our woodies and our custom cars
And when we drove around we knew we were bad
My baby listens to my car radio
And when we're cruising lets the whole world know
And when our favorite surfing song comes on
We always let them know it's "Totally Rad!"


California calling
She's still on the line
There's a beautiful woman
Going to show me how
To ride them at the county line




 All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (on a winter's day)
I'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (If I was in L.A.)
California dreamin' (California dreamin'
On such a winter's day)
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees (Got down on my knees)

 Cashmere hills filled with evergreens
Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea
With the granite cliff as a referee
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns
Mother deer with their newborn fawns
Under Big Sur skies and that's where I belong

Big Sur I've got plans for you
Me and mine are going to
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers

And live in canyons covered with a springtime green
While birds and flowers to be heard and seen
And on my old guitar I'll make up songs to sing
Sparklin' springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river rushing to the tide
Where my kids can search for sea shells at low tide

Big Sur my astrology it says that I am meant to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water
And so while stars shine brightly and up above

Fog rolls in through a redwood grove
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log




 On my way to sunny California
On my way to spend another sunny day

Water, water get yourself in the cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
The sun shines brightly down on the bay
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away

Have you ever been south of Monterey
Barrancas carve the coast line and the chaparral flows to the sea
'Neath waves of golden sunshine
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay
The south coast plows the sea
And the people there are of the breed
They don't need electricity

Water, water, cool cascades of clear, clear water
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way

Have you ever been down Salinas way?
Where Steinbeck found the valley
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be
There the monarch's autumn journey ends
On a windswept cyprus tree

Water get water get yourself in that
Get yourself in that get yourself in that cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
Get yourself in that water
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away

Have you ever been to a festival, the Big Sur congregation?
Where Country Joe will do his show
And he'd sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air, one big family
Yeah the people there love to sing and share
Their new found liberty

 An eagle's nest on the head of an old redwood on one of the
Precipice-footed ridges above Ventana Creek
That jagged country which nothing but a fallen meteor will ever plow:
No horseman will ever ride there, and no hunter cross this ridge but the winged ones
No one will steal the eggs from this fortress
The she-eagle is old, her mate was shot long ago, she is now mated with a son of hers
When lightning blasted her nest she built it again on the same tree, in the splinters of the thunder bolt
In a broken shack an old man takes his time about dying
And just at the back a wild flowerbed that he'll lie in
In dawn's new light a man might venture
A horse drawn stage from Monterey

The she-eagle is older than I: she was here when the fires of eighty-five raged on these ridges
She was lately fledged and dared not hunt ahead of them, but ate scorched meat
The world has changed in her time; humanity has multiplied
But not here; men's hopes and thoughts and customs have changed, their powers are enlarged, their powers and their follies have become fantastic
Spilled down the hill a wagon load of bodies lay scattered, shipwrecked at sea
Limestone ore is all that mattered
They took it from the hills right through the cargo doors
How many ships have come and gone at Thurso's landing shore?

The unstable animal never has been changed so rapidly
The motor and the plane and the great war have gone over him
And Lenin has lived and Jehovah died: while the mother-eagle hunts her same hills, crying the same beautiful and lonely cry
And is never tired: dreams the same dreams
And hears at night the rock-slides rattle and thunder in the
Throats of these living mountains
It is good for man to try all changes, progress and corruption, powers, peace and anguish
Not to go down the dinosaur's way until all his capacities have been explored: and it is good for him
To know that his needs and nature are no more changed, in fact, in ten thousand years than the beaks of eagles
Of the eagle's plight, we know that nature's balance is undone
And it's the birthright of man to unify and live his life as one
A whisper of the word will let you soar with your soul




 Been too long
I miss you darling
I miss you so hard

I miss you darling
I miss you so hard

Now (Miss you darling)
Come back baby

Windows of darkness are
All I can see through
Searching the shadows
Hoping to see you

Can't wait forever
Awoke in the night again
We were together

Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run
Wo run a-run a doo run run

Well my steady little doll is a real-live beauty
And everybody knows she's a car crazy cutie
She's hip to everything man from customs to rails
And axle grease imbedded 'neath her fingernails


A power shift in second and a-riding the clutch
My car crazy cutie, man, she's just too much
I take her to the drags, man, and everyone flips
For her big blue eyes and her candy apple lips


Yeah oh
Car crazy cutie 

Well I guess you might say she's the rodder's dream gal
Always there to help, man, when you need a pal
But when I talk of loving man, some kisses and hugs
Says she's like to take 'em better clean and gap the plugs




 




 Where did your long hair go
Where is the girl I used to know
How could you lose that happy glow
Oh Caroline, no
Who took that look away
I remember how you used to say
You'd never change, but that's not true
Oh Caroline, you
Break my heart
I want to go and cry
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh, Caroline why
Could I ever find in you again
The things that made me love you so much then
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone
Oh Caroline, no

 Hello

My luck was so bad
I thought I used up all the luck I had
Everytime I thought I'd get it on
Someone put me on
There's been a change
Beautiful and strange
My life's gone through a change
Somehow I know (somehow I know)
Bad luck's in the past
All good things here at last
So now we'll grow

There's been a change
Mmmmm
Bad luck (no more)
No bad luck (no more)
I got news for you

There ain't no blues
I got news for you
No bad luck (no more)
I got news for you

Listen to the boys loud and clear
Come on folks withstand you fears
Sail away the choice is yours you choose
Celebrate the news
There ain't no blues
Come on, come on, come on




 Going to the chapel
And we're going to get married
Going to the chapel
And we're going to get married

Gee, I really love you
And we're going to get married
Going to the chapel of love

Spring is here, the sky is blue
Birds all sing like they knew
Today's the day, we'll say, "I do"
And we'll never be lonely anymore



Bells will ring, the sun will shine
I'll be hers and she'll be mine
We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely anymore




 Go cherry, cherry coupe now

The wildest short around is my cherry, cherry coupe
It's the sharpest thing in town and the envy of my group
It's one of its kind and it really looks good
Chopped nose and deck with louvers on the hood

Go cherry cherry coupe now
Go cherry cherry coupe now
Go cherry cherry coupe now
(My cherry coupe beats 'em up comin' off the line)
Go cherry cherry coupe now
(And she really gets sparks when she starts to whine)

Chrome reversed rims with whitewall slicks
And it turns a quarter mile in one oh six
Door handles are off but you know I'll never miss 'em
They open when I want with the solenoid system


My coupe's tuck and roll underneath the hood
And the rugs, seats, and panels now are looking good
When I go looking for something to do
She's got enough room now to barely seat two

 A child of winter
A child of the snow
I'm making a snowball
That someone will throw
I'm making a snowman
With charcoal for the eyes
A scarf draped in red
And a derby on his head
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer are pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
The evening of Christmas
Presents have been passed
The wood in the fireplace
Is glowing its last
I'm closing my eyes now
In my bed I'm snuggling
Outside my window
The carolers sing
Christmas comes and the snow covers all
Trees are decorated with tinsel and lights
Mama's in the kitchen making cookies and bread
The children are hungry, they're waiting to be fed
A child of Christmas
A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
And may your Christmas
Last all year
With laughter of children
Peace and cheer
A child of Christmas
A child of snow
A wonderful feeling
Underneath the mistletoe
Merry Christmas to you
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells
Ding dong ding go the bells

 The Christmas spirit grows with each new day
And it's so close but seems so far away
And yet it comes only once a year
And before you know it, it's already here
The streets are filled with laughter
And so many hearts are gay
Everybody helps to make the spirit bright
The houses turn on their Christmas lights at night

It's worth the wait the whole year through
Just to make happy someone like you
And I'll never outgrow the thrill of Christmas day

It's worth the wait the whole year through
Just to make happy someone like you




 It's that time of year again
That Christmas time feelin' is here again
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
I see snow flurries comin' down
Paint a pretty party scene all over town
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
Lots of mistletoe hangin' everywhere
Plenty of free gifts and so don't despair
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
She's so pretty but I'm so young
When I'm sixteen I'm gonna have some fun
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas time is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
All the little children of this great big world
Are waitin' for the season's biggest thrill
I wonder if I'll ever be able to get to sleep again
'Cause the Christmas time thrill is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
Been tossin' and a-turnin' all through the night
I'll be wide awake until broad daylight
'Cause Christmas, Christmas, Christmas Eve is here again
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
Old Saint Nick'll be stoppin' in
To see the lady of the house again
I wonder if he'll ever go and try to kiss Mommy on the cheek again
'Cause the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh
Yes, the Christmas time feelin' is in the air again
Ahh ahhh ahh




 Here a mug, there a mug, everybody chug-a-lug

Gary likes a girl's tight black pants
Larry knows he doesn't stand a chance
Carl says hurry up and order it quick
Dave gets out to chase that chick
Dennis wonders what's under the hood
A big chrome tack and it sounds real good
I go down to the root beer stand
And drink up all that I can

Give me some root beer (chug-a-lug chug-a-lug chug-a-lug)
Cold beer, root beer
Here a mug, there a mug, everybody chug-a-lug

Brian's still glued to the radio
Louie's looking out the rear window
Guy's got around to ordering fries
But root beer's my best buy


Root beer, need another mug now
Root beer, chug-a-lug-a-lug now




 Go like this
All right, knock it off
Cindy, Oh Cindy
Bye Mom
One-two, a one-two-three

I joined the Navy to see the world
But nowhere could I find
A girl as sweet as Cindy
The girl I left behind
I've searched the wide world over
Can't get her out of my mind

Cindy, oh Cindy
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)
Cindy don't let me down
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)
Write me a letter, dear
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)
And I'll be homeward bound
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)

I see her face in every wave
Her lips kiss every breeze
Her loving arms reach out to me
Through calm and stormy sea
At night I face the lonely day
Caressed by memories


I know my Cindy's waiting for me
As I walk the decks alone
Her loving arms reach out to me
Soon I'll be heading home
Then my sailing days will be over
No more will I roam


(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)

 Cooling, so cooling, cooling me

Have some cool clear water
(Drink a little drip, drip, drip, drip, drink a little)
(Water cooling me)


Water, water, water, water, water, water
Now, now, now, now, now



When the heat's got you down
Here's what you ought to
Get yourself in that cool, cool water
(Cooling so cool, cooling me)
Cool, cool water
Get yourself in that cool, cool water
(Cooling, so cool, cooling me)
Cool cool water

In an ocean or in a glass
Cool water is such a gas
Cooling, so cooling, cooling me
From the mountains on down to the sea
Cool water keeps on cooling me
When the nights are too hot to keep cool
I keep on dreaming about a swimming pool
When I'm just too hot to move
Cool, cool water is such a groove
In a shady spot when I'm laying down
Only thing moving are the ants on the ground

When I'm thirsty and I reach for a glass
Cool water tastes like such a gas
From the mountains on down to the sea
Cool, cool water keeps on cooling me
Get yourself in that cool, cool water now
Cool, cool water keeps on cooling me




 When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home
Let me tell you now well, I got me in a fix
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickitey splits
I had to walk a long, long way to town
I came upon a nice old man well, he had a hat on
Wait a minute, mister, can you give me some directions?
I'm gonna want to be right off for home

In them old cotton fields back home

Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Rise up early the day won't let you sleep

 This time each year in our hometown
The county fair comes our way
Where the folks gather round to be happy and spend their day
A-here's what happened now
I soon decide that I'd take with me
The most specialest girl I knew
I had her pack us a lunch and on down the dirt road we flew

Folk: "Hurry hurry, step right up and win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Aw, come on Nicky, win me a koala bear!"
Folk: "Break the balloon with a dart! Yes, you son, come up here! Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!
Girl: "Oh please, win me a koala bear!"
Folk: "Break the balloon with a dart! Come on son, step right up! Get up there, that's a boy!"

Right then I knew what I had to do
(Hurry, hurry)
Before that day was through
(Step right up)
I had to win a stuffed doggie or I'd break her poor heart in two
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
A-let me tell you now
I passed up a chance when I walked by a booth
(Hurry, hurry)
Where you throw a dart and break a balloon
(Step right up)
I snuck by a couple more, but I had to get caught real soon
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)

Folk: "Step right up, test your strength! Come on, son, ring the bell with the hammer!"
Girl: "Aww, come on, muscles!"
Folk: "Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Ooohhh"
Folk: "Come on son, are you a man or a weakling? Yes, you, step up here and test your strength! Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Come on, baby!"
Folk: "Come on, son!"

I hit the rubber stump just as hard as I could
(Hurry, hurry)
But I didn't make it ring the bell
(Step right up)
I tried again and again, but I just didn't do so well
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
Can you believe it now
Up walked a fellow and he tapped me on the shoulder, said
(Hurry, hurry)
"I can win your girl a prize"
(Step right up)
So he flexed all his muscles and he knocked the bell up in the sky
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)

Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Hurry, hurry)
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Step right up)
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Folk: "Step right up son, test your strength!")
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Folk: "Come on kid, ring the bell!")
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Girl: "Ah, goodbye, muscles, I don't need you anymore")
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Girl: "Loser!")




 I've been keeping my eyes on you
I finally found the nerve to talk to you
There's something that you ought to know
Don't you know that I love you so
Our life together could be eternal bliss
If we could just get close enough to kiss
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your love

Crack at your love

You make me feel so warm inside
A sense of humor you can't hide
Who taught you darling how to move that way?
And when you smile I know the world's okay
And when I see the twinkle in your eye
It sends my heart all the way to the sky
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your love


Lonely nights, lonely days
I'm reaching out for you
In my mind

I'm going crazy
Would you be my baby
I'm going to need a little help from above
Would you say "no" if I asked for your love?
I can't afford to get hurt again
Like the time I remember when
But I know I'd like to get a crack at your
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your
Don't you know I'd like to get a crack at your love




 I remember when rock was young
Me and Susie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doin' a thing called Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock
Well, Crocodile Rockin' is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh, Lawdy Mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was-a out of sight
La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la
But the years went by and the rock just died
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the dreams we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought that Crocodile Rock would last
Well, Crocodile Rockin' is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh, Lawdy Mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was-a out of sight
La la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la

 We knew it must have been late
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
We had no time to wait
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I went to light the fireplace
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I planned it all this way, and
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I snuggled close to her
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
Her heart began to purr
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I held my breath inside, and then
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I put my arms around her
(Tick-tock)

Cuckoo, cuckoo (go away silly bird)
Cuckoo, cuckoo

I put that birdie away
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
His cuckoo was gone to stay
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
We both apologized for why
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
Forgave that doggone cuckoo
I went back to her side
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I had to swallow my pride
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
The fire had almost died away
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
We just got situated
(Tick-tock)


I took that clock apart
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
I broke the cuckoo's heart
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
He'll never bother us again
(Tick-tock, tick-tock)
We just forgot about him
(Tick-tock)




 The night has come
Cuddle up to me
Keep warm
Mmm close to me

In dreams
We'll dream
Making love to wake
To find
Mmm we're still one

Your love
Your love
Your love
Your love for me
Is so
Warm and good to me
Growing every day
Honey
Honey
I'm in love
Ooooo

I know a man
Who's so in love
Mm mm




 Check my custom machine

Well she's metal flake blue with a corvette grill
(Check my custom machine)
And they say it looks better when she's standing still

(Check my custom machine)
When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

Well with naugahyde bucket seats in front and back
(Check my custom machine)
Everything is chrome, man, even my jack


With stereophonic speaker set with vibra sonic sound
(Check my custom machine)
Magnesium spokes, it stands an inch off the ground


Oo oo oo

 Bring back, bring back my baby
Daybreak over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Bring my my baby back to me?
And the stars sprinkle the morning
Venus fades form my sight
Will my love be returning
Like the Sun to brightening over my life?

Days break over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Bring my my baby back to me?
Bring it back
Oh, bring it back
Bring my back my baby

Darling, if you could only
Hear this song in my heart
Then you will know why you need, never feel lonely
We'll soon be together, never to depart
And as long as there is an ocean
Long as stars are to shine
Baby you will always have my devotion, have my devotion
I'll love you pretty baby
Till then end of time


As long as there is an ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Will bring my baby to me
Darling if you should ever
Wonder what you should do
Baby you should know I'll love you forever
Maybe little darling that will see you through
And as the sunset set over the ocean
And the world fades from you
Baby always knew my love and devotion
Will bright up the night
Because I love you

Bring back, bring back
Bring it back
Bring back my baby
Won't you?
Bring back, bring back
Bring it back
Bring back my baby
Won't you bring back my baby?




 Deirdre

The trouble you had
It wasn't so bad
It's only life and what you're living for
Sit down right here
I'll send away your tears
Well we don't have to talk about it much more

Good things turn bad but it's over now
So don't look sad because you're older now
Lots of people miss Deirdre

You're back again
You still have all your friends
And they used to ask me why'd you go away, Deirdre
What could I say
That you ran away
Don't you think it's time that you stayed right near me

These nights, pretty nights, that were meant to be
With you and me
It's the way that we
Always had our love, Deirdre

I love your red hair
Deirdre da-da-ra-ra-ra-ra
Deir-Deir-Deir-Deirdre
I'm glad you're home again
Ooh hoo
Ooh hoo
Baby 1, 2, 3 and you're back with me

Tomorrow at ten
I'll wake you and then
We'll take a bath and then I'll laugh again with Deirdre

You may not live with me every day
All that I care is that we find a way
To stay together with Deirdre
Deirdre da-da-ra-ra-ra-ra
Deir-Deir-Deir-Deirdre




 I'm blessed with everything
A world to which a man can cling
So happy times when I break out in tears
In the back of my mind I still have my fears
I live my life with her
Love her true she knows I'm sure
I make her happy just living so plain
In the back of my mind I'm 'fraid it's gonna change
I tried to run far way from thoughts
I should try to keep away
But they just keep coming back to me
I tried to rationalize
But some day I might realize
That things are just good the way they'll be
I know it's so hard to find
A girl who really understands your mind
What will I do if I lose her
It will always be way in the back of my mind




 Santa Claus is coming to town...
Christmas is a joyous time of year
But for an underprivileged child, this isn't always true
This is Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys
Alan, Michael, Carl, Brian and myself would like to ask
All of you to join in with us in donating a toy to an
Underprivileged children organization, so they, too
Might possibly share in a very, very happy Christmas this year
Thank you




 




 Darling, you can count on me
Til the sun dries up the sea
(?)
Until then, I'll always be
Devoted to you
I'll be yours through endless time
I'll adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that I'm
Devoted to you

I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie
I'll never be untrue
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue

Through the years, my love will grow
Like a river, it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
Devoted to you



Ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba bom

(That was beautiful.)
(Great.)
(Yay!)
(That was great.)
(Hey, Brian, I ...)

I love a girl, I love her so madly
I treat her so fine but she treats me so badly

 Clearing skies and drying eyes
Now I see your smile
Darkness goes and softness shows
A changing style
Just in time words that rhyme
Well bless your soul
Now I'll fill your hands
With kisses and a Tootsie Roll

Oh reality, it's not for me
And it makes me laugh
Oh, fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

Patti Page and summer days
On old Cape Cod
Happy times making wine
In my garage
Country shade and lemonade
Guess I'm slowing down
It's a turned back world
With a local girl
In a smaller town

Open cars and clearer stars
That's what I've lacked
But fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

Love...Hi Rick and Dave
Hi Pop...Well good morning mom
Love...get up guess what
I'm in love with a girl I found
She's really swell
Cause she likes
Church, bingo chances and old time dances
All my life I spent the night
With dreams of you
And the warmth I missed
And for the things I wished
They're all coming true
I've got my love to give
And a place to live
Guess I'm going to stay
It'd be a peaceful life
With a forever wife
And a kid someday

It's earlier nights
And pillow fights
And your soft laugh
Fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

 It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go
Suntanned bodies and
Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Let's get together and
Do it again
With a girl the lonely sea looks good in moonlight
Makes your night times warm and out of sight

(Been so long, long, long, long)
Been so long
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)
(Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now)

Well I've been thinking about
All the places we've surfed and danced and
All the faces we've missed so let's get
Back together and do it again
Ow! Come on and do it again

 The girls dig the way the guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air you can hear them shout
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, (a-oo) they don't back down

Don't back down
You got to be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show them now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave

With their feet full of tar and their hair full of sand
The boys know the surf like the palm of their hand
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth (a-oo) they don't back down


When a twenty-footer sneaks up like a ton of lead
And the crest comes along and slaps them upside the head
They're not afraid (don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys (Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth (a-oo) they don't back down


Don't back down




 Don't ever say you're not afraid of any wave boy
Then turn and run for your life cause you're not thrilled boy
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
Just grit your teeth take it on but don't back down

Don't back down don't back down
From that wave

I used to laugh when I saw a surfer go under
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
Until I tried it and my ears sounded just like thunder
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
I know what it's like when you feel like backing down


It's just as scary as it looks and it's rough enough now
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
And if you're any kind of athlete you're tough enough now
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
You're going to find out when you start backing down




 The girls dig the way
The guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air
You can hear 'em shout
They're not afraid
(Don't back down, don't back down)
Not my boys
(Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, they don't back down
(Don't back down)
You gotta be a little nuts
(Don't back down)
But show 'em now who's got guts
(Don't back down)
Don't back down from that wave
With their feet full of tar
And their hair full of sand
The boys know the surf
Like the palm of their hand
They're not afraid
(Don't back down, don't back down)

(Don't back down)
You gotta be a little nuts
(Don't back down)
But show 'em now who's got guts
(Don't back down)
Don't back down from that wave
When a twenty footer sneaks up like a ton of lead
And the crest come along and slaps them up side the head
They don't back down
Not my boys
(Don't back down, don't back down)
They grit their teeth, they don't back down
(Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
(Don't back down)
But show 'em now who's got guts
(Don't back down)
Don't back down from that wave
Don't back down
Don't back down
Don't back down
Don't back down

 Don't go near the water
Don't you think it's sad
What's happened to the water
Our water's going bad

Oceans, rivers, lakes and streams
Have all been touched by man
The poison floating out to sea
Now threatens life on land

Don't go near the water
Ain't it sad
What's happened to the water
It's going bad
Don't go near the water
Don't go near the water

Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath
So let's avoid an ecological aftermath
Beginning with me
Beginning with you

Don't go near the water
To do it any wrong
To be cool with the water
Is the message of this song

Let's all help the water
Right away
Do what we can and ought to
Let's start today




 There she goes she ran in her room
She'll probably stay in there the rest of the day
It sounds like it must have been something you said
You know she's awful used to getting her way

Why don't you kiss her
(Why don't you kiss her
And while you kiss her
(Tell her you miss her
Why don't you treat her
(Why don't you treat her
Treat her nice

Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister

You know she digs you and thinks you're a real groovy guy
But yet I'm not sure that I feel the same
We both know that you've been making her cry
I hope you don't think it's some kind of game

Why don't you love her
(Why don't you love her
Like her big brother
(Like her big brother
Why don't you tell her
(Why don't you tell her
Tell her you're sorry




 I can hear so much in your sighs
And I can see so much in your eyes
There are words we both could say
But don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and let me hear your heart beat
Being here with you feels so right
We could live forever tonight lets not think about tomorrow
And don't talk put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and listen to my heart beat
Listen, listen, listen
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, put your head on my shoulder




 I can hear so much in your sighs
And I can see so much in your eyes
There are words we both could say

But don't talk, put your head on my shoulder
Come close, close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand and let me hear your heart beat

Being here with you feels so right
We could live forever tonight
Let's not think about tomorrow

And don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Come close
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk, take my hand
And listen to my heart beat

Listen, listen, listen


Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder
Don't talk
Close your eyes and be still
Don't talk
Put your head on my shoulder




 Well its been building up inside of me
For oh I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong
But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far
She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

She told me "Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"
Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

Beaded, cheering Indians behind them
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Bicycle Rider, just see what you've done-
Done to the church of the American Indian!
Once upon the Sandwich Isles
The social structure steamed upon Hawaii

Done to the church of the American Indian!
Mahala-lu-lei

Having returned to the East or the West Indies...
We always got them confused

 Little Richard sang it and Dick Clark brought it to life
Danny and the Juniors hit a groove, stuck as sharp as a knife

Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll

Chuck Berry's got to be the greatest thing that's come along
(Hum diddy waddy, hum diddy wadda)
He made the guitar beats and wrote the all-time greatest song
(Hum diddy waddy, hum diddy wadda)

Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll
(Hum diddy waddy doo)

Elvis Presley is the king
He's the giant of the day
Paved the way for the rock and roll stars
Yeah the critics kept a knocking
But the stars kept a rocking
And the chopping didn't get very far
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Nothing's really moving until the saxophone's ready to blow
(Do you remember, do you remember)
And the beat's not jumping until the drummer says he's ready to go
(Do you remember, do you remember)


Let's hear the high voice wail (oooooooooo)
And hear the voice down low (wah-ah ah-ah)
Let's hear the background
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll




 Do you want to dance and hold my hand
Tell me baby I'm your lover man
Oh baby do you want to dance?

Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Hold me baby all through the night
Oh baby
Do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance
Do you, do you, do you
Do you want to dance?

Do you want to dance under the moonlight
Kiss me baby all through the night
Oh baby
Do you want to dance?




 Ooo wah
Ooo wah

Everytime I have a date there's only one place to go
That's to the drive in
It's such a groovy place to talk and maybe watch a show
Down at the drive in
Forget about the plot, it'll do very well
But make sure you see enough so you're prepared to tell

About the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)

If the windows get fogged you'll have to take a breath
(Ooo waah ooo)
Down at the drive in
(Wah wah ooo)
Or the cat dressed in white will scare you both to death
Down at the drive in
A big buttered popcorn and an extra large coke
A few chili dogs and man I'm going broke

Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
Yeah at the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)

Don't sneak your buddies in the trunk because they might get caught
By the drive in
(Wah wah wah ooo)
And they'd look kind of stupid getting chased through the lot
(Wah ooo)
Around the drive in

If you say you watch the movie you're a couple of liars
And "Remember only you can prevent forest fires"
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)




 Ocean lovers who like to harmonize
They're all cousins friends and brothers
And they make their Mamas cry
They're record-making heart-breaking
Just West Coast boys
What I know it's a beginning of an endless harmony
Striped shirt freedom
Brave new worlds
Go out on the road
Where there's mid-sixties screaming
And that night time holiday scheming
While a lifestyle turns to gold
Music's growing
And vibrations showing
What's it all mean
I know it means there's an endless harmony

And we sang God bless America
It's a land where we tour
She takes great care of us
And people love for where we sing
We sing doot doo doot, doot doo doot, doot doo doo doo




 Everyone's in love with you
But you can't fall in love with anyone
Still everyone's in love with you
Though you can't fall in love with only one
So many people have had a love affair
Have had a love to share like mine
But I tell you people
I found something new
A love of a different kind
Everyone's in love with you
Though most just barely glimpse a part of you
They all can see your love shine through
It comes from deep within the heart of you
So many people have had their love affairs
Had their loves to share like mine
Now I tell you people
I witnessed something new
A love that could only be divine

Everyone's in love with you
And though you can't belong to only one
Still everyone's in love with you
Because (because) you gave your love
(Because) Because you gave your love (you gave your love)
Because you gave your love to everyone

 Unfolding enveloping missiles of soul
Recall senses sadly
Mirage like soft blue like lanterns below
To light the way gladly
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
Whether wind withers memory
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

Feel flows (White hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feel goes (Black hot glistening shadowy flows)

Unbending never ending tablets of time
Record all the yearning
Unfearing all appearing message divine
Eases the burning
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
Whether hope dampens memory
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side


Encasing all embracing wreath of repose
Engulfs all the senses
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
Retire the fences
Whether wholly heartened life fades away
Whether harps heal the memory
Whether wholly heartened life fades away
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

Feel goes (White hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feel flows (Black hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feel goes (White hot glistening shadowy flows)
Feelings to grow (White hot glistening shadowy flows)

White hot glistening shadowy flows
White hot glistening shadowy flows
White hot glistening shadowy flows




 I kicked out of the surf
And stuck my board in the sand
And then up in my Woody
To a hamburger stand
And when I got back
My nine five board was gone

She said yeah she said
(Finders keepers)
Finders keepers
(Losers weepers)
Losers weepers
(Finders keepers)
Finders keepers
Finders keepers
Losers weepers

I saw a Hodaddy
Paddling out by the pier
Well he must have got my board
Cause mine isn't here
But I know how to fix him
I'll just raise that meatball flag


He took off on a swell
When he saw the flag
He's just a crazy Hodaddy
Pulling some kind of gag
He went over the falls
And now my board's
Coming back to me


That'll teach him to mess with my board
Next pass next time




 If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever (together my love)
I ask the sky just what we had
It shone forever
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever (together my love)

Forever
I've been so happy loving you

Together my love
Let the love I have for you
Live in your heart
And beat forever (together my love)
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you

Baby, just let me sing it, my baby
I want to be singing, my baby
Baby, baby, baby, my baby
I want to be singing

So I'm going away
But not forever
Na, na, na, na
I got to love you anyway
Forever

 We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give

We drift apart for a little bit of a spell
One night I get a call and I know that you're well
And days I was down you would help me get out of my hole
Let's be friends
You told me when my girl was untrue
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair




 Why don't you run away and spend some time with me
On this summer's day, there's nowhere else I'd rather be
Why don't we feel the way we used to anymore
There's a place along the way, that maybe we could stay
And listen to the waves at my front door
You've been thinking 'bout some things we used to do
Thinking 'bout when life was still in front of you
Back where you belong, our favorite song
Won't you listen
Don't you understand the words
Are singing in the wind
I wish that we could get from there to back again
The clouds are breaking, it's a beautiful day
For a wonderful, Pacific coast getaway
The sun is shining, could we just find a way
I you just call, just fall, just fall
To the ground
Through our compromise, paradise
Is just another place up on the wall
Through the common sense of it all
We had a lot to live, we gave it all
Through the consequence of the wine
Another place in time




 Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away"
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, "Catch me if you can"
He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard them holler, "Stop!"
Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"

 Full sail full sail
Steady as you go
The wind will blow
Set sail at Frisco Bay
In a fog cold and gray
Clear sailing, day after day
Full sail full sail
Now the air is still
We lay adrift
Come upon a sea of trouble
Till the winds of change shift
My course is set
There's no turning back
But there's no going anywhere yet
Full sail full sail
Waiting for the wind to blow
The wind will blow
Does the silence of the sea
Sound warning of a storm ahead
Whispers of the breeze
Stir and disappear
To soft to hear
What's in store for me

Adventure on the high seas
Put the childhood dream to the test
Find the measure of the man
Follow the sun heading west

Full sail
Steady as you go
Steady as you go
Full sail
Waiting for the wind to blow
The wind will blow
Hey full sail
Mmmm mmmmm
Hey full sail




 Well she got her daddy's car and she cruised through the hamburger stand, now
Seems she forgot all about the library like she told her old man, now

 A Pisces lady loves romance (She loves romance)
Her movements tell you at a glance (She loves to dance)
Why they say Pisces rules the dance (She's got the glance)
She values flowers more than gold (She flows like gold)
Thinks of her men as knights of old (She's never bold)
She's very spiritual I'm told (She has never told)
Whoa
But where's my spark in the dark?
Glow glow glow c'mon glow
The funky pretty flame in my heart
Me and my Pisces lady are apart
Her calender is not like ours (She rules the hours)
The hieroglyphs mark changing hours (She rules the stars)
Her guiding light is from the stars (She's got the powers)
Whoa
A book of verse a jug of wine (She's soft like wine)
She'll always tell what's on your mind (She's much like time)
By just your birthday place and time (She's very fine)
'Cause it's a silent night in the sea
And if you're cosmical'y conscious you'll see
Why she's a princess incarnate to me
Daughter of Neptune the ruler of the sea

The queen in Copenhagee (Funky pretty)
The dream of Amsterdamee (Pretty funky)
The cream of gay Parisee (Funky pretty)
The theme of U Say Asee (Pretty funky)
The scene in Great Britainyee (Funky pretty)
The meaning in Los Angees (Pretty funky)
The heat in Tokyosee (Funky pretty)
The treat in Manhattohsee (Pretty funky)
Yeah yeah funky pretty

She said "Don't worry it's alright
I'm coming back when the aspects are right"
And now I look in the paper each day
Wondering what my horoscope will say

Funky (oooo funky)
I still remember funky pretty (ooooo)
Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why
(Why can't you tell me why)




 I just looked to see the sun outside
It's shining so bright
A sun the clouds can't hide
Do you remember the time that you hear me say
I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh
No more
The juke box daddies been blowin' my mind
I ain't goin' nowhere I got lots of time
I'm fat as a cow oh how'd I ever get this way
I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh
No more
In the morning people are so happy
And that's the time when I'm a mister bussinessman
Later on I really get to goin' yeah
I get my motor runnin'
I get my legs to movin'
It's just no good unless two can play
Ah ha haaaa
I was layin' on my back
Relaxin' in the night
I played my radio
It was out of sight
Joe South was singing
"Games People Play"
And I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah-e-eah
Ah ha ha ha haaa




 Es gibt ein Ort, da geh' ich hin
Flüst're Freud und Leid
Ganz allein, ganz allein
Ganz allein
Schloss und Riegel schließen aus
Furcht und Sorgen hier
Ganz allein, ganz allein
Ganz allein
Träume hier, schmiede Pläne
Ohne Schlaf zu fleh'n
Durch mein Weinen und mein Seufzen
Lachend schau zurück
Dunkel ist's, ich bin allein
Doch fürchte ich mich nicht
Ganz allein, ganz allein
Ganz allein
Ganz allein
Allein
Ganz allein
Allein
Ganz allein
Ganz allein




 Es gibt ein Ort da geh ich hin

Ohne Schlaf zu fleh'n
Durch mein Weinen und mein Seufzen
Lachend schau zurueck

Dunkel ist's, ich bin allein doch
Fuerchte ich mich nicht


Ganz allein
Allein

 I wake up in the morning
Just to work all through the day
That sun can get so hot that you
Can sweat your strength away
And oh come the night time...
Gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind of woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I got to find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl
But I still get up in the morning
Though it's so hard all day long
If it weren't for the love of a woman
I don't think I'd continue on
And oh come the night time...
Gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind of woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I got to find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl
I'm gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind of woman
Hungry, hungry for my kind of woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I got to find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl...




 Hi little girl, it's me
Don't you know who I am?
I met you last summer when
When I came up to stay with my gran
I'm the guy-uy-uy who
Left you with tears in his eyes
You didn't answer my letters
So I figured it was just a lie

Your hair's getting longer and your shorts
Mmm they sure fit you fine
I'll bet you went out
Every night during ol' school time
But this ti-I-ime I'm not gonna count on you
I'll see you this summer
And forget you when I go back to school

Girl Don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time



Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time




 Ah ah ah ah oo ooo ooo oo ahh
The girls on the beach

On the beach you'll find them there
In the sun and salty air
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
If you know what to do

How we love to lie around
Girls with tans of golden brown
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
And one waits there for you
(Girls on the beach)

The sun in her hair
The warmth of the air
On a summer day

As the sun dips out of sight
Couples on the beach at night
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
And with the boys tonight
(Girls on the beach)

Girls on the beach, girls on the beach 




 I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it

 Oo oo oo ooo going on

When in the morning
I must arise
I look in the mirror
It couldn't be clearer
Something is gone from my eyes

Going on
Going on
Going on

I know what is missing
Because since you've been gone
My mind keeps on reeling (mind keeps on reeling)
My heart keeps on feeling (heart keeps on feeling)
Why is my love going on (going on)


I love you
I miss you
Things won't be the same till I kiss you
I'm empty
Without you
My heart's full with my arms about you
Ooo ooo ooo ah ah ah
We said it was over
We're living apart
We couldn't quite make it (couldn't quite make it)
But still I can't shake it (but still I can't shake it)
Our love still lives on in my heart (in my heart)


I love you
Forever
Love won't be the same again ever (same again ever)
Without you (without you)
I'm longing (I'm longing)
You gave me a sense of belonging
Oo oo oo oo oo going on
Why is my love going on (goin on)


I love you
I miss you
I'm sorry
Forgive me (won't you forgive me)
Believe me (believe me)
My lover (my lover)
There never could be any other
Ooo oooo oooo
Going on

Come be my
Redeemer
Awaken me beautiful dreamer (beautiful dreamer)
I love you (I love you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Things won't be the same till I'm with you
Ahhhhhhhhhhh




 I think of going south for the winter
It's getting mighty cold
I watch the fire glow
The moon shining 'cross the snow
Maybe Florida or Mexico
Is where I ought to go

Somewhere where everything is green
Oo the change of scene
Might do a me good
When the swallows go
When they leave Capistrano
Fly away so gracefully
Maybe that's for me
Snowdrifts blowing up against my door
Going clear up to the roof
I could be lying on some sun-washed shore
Truth is, don't know what I'm waiting for


South of the border
Think I'm going south
Get my life in order
Think I'm going south
For the winter
It's getting mighty cold




 My girlfriend Betty she's always ready
To help me in any way
She'll do my cooking she's always looking
For ways she can make my day
And when I'm looking at her the sound of pitter patter
On rainy days like today
Could get you feeling warmer
And you know what-a that can lead to

Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
Might go up in smoke now but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time

My girlfriend Penny, she's kind of skinny
And so she needs her falsies on
She don't like cooking but she's so good looking
I miss her when she's gone
And when she gets to dancing I feel just like romancing
Especially when we're dancing close
She'll do the dirty boogie
And that's when I go up in smoke


Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo uh
Wo wo wo
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
Wo wo wo

Good time
Oh good time
Oh good time
Goooooood tiiiiiiiiime

They think I'm bad and I treat her so mean

 I just met a woman on my way home, she just blew my mind
My heart was pumping, I mean all the way home
Got to know the woman
Whoa, I got to know the woman
I love the way you move
You make, make me feel like a man
(You know you make me, make me feel like a man)
Love the way you're looking
You look like you like it, too
(You know you look like you like it, too)

Got to know the woman
(Mama, mama, mama, mama, oom mow mow)

If you feel the feel I feel, you dig the feel of me
(You know you look like you dig feeling me)
Love the way you feel, dear
Ah, you make a, make a man out of me
(You make, you make a man out of me)
Come on, come on, come on and do the chicken

I mean
Baby, I'm going to tell you something right now
You got so much soul you blow my mind
Oh baby, there's just one thing I want to say




 There's a time a for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years

We'll remember always
Graduation day

At the senior prom
We danced till three
And there you gave your heart to me


Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone

When the ivy walks
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind




 There's a time a for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years
We'll remember always
Graduation day
At the senior prom
We danced 'til three
And there you gave your heart to me
We'll remember always
Graduation day
Take it away
Take five
Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone
When the ivy walks
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind
We'll remember always
Graduation day
We'll remember always
Graduation (day) day




 The way I act don't seem like me
I'm not on top like I used to be
I'll give in when I know I should be strong
I still give in even though I know it's wrong, know it's wrong
I guess I'm dumb but I don't care
And breaking off wasn't hard to do
But I couldn't stay away from you
I feel love but not the way I did before
This time girl, has got to be forever more, ever more
I guess I'm dumb but I don't care
And baby since we've been apart
Maybe I've found I had a heart
I couldn't let go even if I wanted to
You must know baby now it's only you, only you
I guess I'm dumb but I don't care

(Guess I'm dumb)




 Had to phone you
Had to phone you just to talk to you
Had to phone you just to tell you I was missing you
It lifts my spirits every single time
Sometimes you're busy for awhile
But when you get through
It makes me smile
When I phone you
California's not so far away
You're not alone, you know I'm only just a dial away
I visualize that you're looking fine
Feels so good when you come on the line

You (you) you (you) you (you) you (you)

Come on and answer the phone
Come on, come on
(I hope your home)




 I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

They come on like their peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day
And waste all their thoughts at night

Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know I'm guilty




(Bark)
Hey Chuck is it possible we could bring a horse in here without, if we
Don't screw anything up

Honest to God, now, the horse is tamed and everything

Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
They come on like they're peaceful, but inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight




 I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone
Now what can you tell them?
What can you say that won't make them defensive?
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
They come on like they're peaceful, but inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight




 Do you want to go straight to Hawaii, Hawaii?
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Or do you want to come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you want to come along with me?)

I heard about all the pretty girls
With their grass skirts down to their knees
All my life I wanted to see
The island called Hawaii


Now, I don't know what town you're from
But don't tell me that they got bigger waves
Because everyone that goes
Comes back with nothing but raves


Now, pretty soon this Winter
They'll hold the Surfing Championship of the year
Surfer guys and girls
Will be coming from far and near




 Do you wanna go straight to Hawaii, Hawaii?
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Straight to Hawaii
(Hawaii, Hawaii)
Or do you wanna come along with me?
(Honolulu, Waikiki)
(Do you wanna come along with me?)

 Every time
We have a fight
We flip a coin
To see who's right

Why do we have to gamble just to see who's right?
Why can't we arbitrarily resolve a fight?
But with your style of gambling there's no chance to win
That's how it is and that's the way it's always been

Heads, you win
Tails, I lose
Heads, you win
Tails, I lose
Bad news

If we were playing cards you'd be the one to deal
You'd play with loaded dice and fix the roulette wheel
You pick them at the races like I've never seen
And then you make me pay off like a slot machine


Oh well, match me honey (match me honey)
Take my money (take my money)
You know the odds are yours (flip it baby)
So flip the coin

I'm going to make some changes with this gambling game
From now on I'm the dealer and I'll do the same
I'll load my dice and stack the deck and fix the odds again
So if you want to flip to see who's right I know I'll win

Heads, I win
Tails, you lose
Heads, I win
Tails, you lose
Bad news



Heads, I win
Tails, you lose
Heads, I win
Tails, you lose
Bad news

 He gives speeches, but they put him back in bed where he wrote his satire
He gives speeches, always reaches out a lot, led him to discover
Silken hair, more silken hair fell on his face, and no wind was blowing
Stepped across the golden fields and saw that she was soon trailing after
She was nice and didn't fight, he fell into her friendly persuasion
Late that night while by a streetlight, little hands shadowed on the ceiling




 Stark naked in front of my mirror
A pudgy person somehow did appear
Seems lately all I've eaten sugar and fat
It's getting obvious that's not where it's at
A big pot and tripley chin
Oh what condition my condition was in
Laughing at myself at what a crying shame
What ever happened to my Greek godly frame
Cyclamates juicy steaks, sweet things too
Aren't always good as they seem
Doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too
That's what you get when you eat that way
I read a book on organic foods
Jumped on a health food kick
Put me in the mood
You may not get to perfect overnight
But on the way you're feelin' clean out of sight
We ate tonight at Fairfax and 3rd
We're gonna spread the news and give you the word
We hope that soon you'll eat like we did today
We're mighty thankful now that H.E.L.P.'s on its way
Salad with a special knock you right off your seat
With carrot juice to wash it all down
Yummy carob cookies are an organic treat
And H.E.L.P. has got the best food in town
H.-E.-L.-P
H.E.L.P. your education creates much benefit and peace
Hamburgers and hot dogs throw 'em all out
You'll feel so good you'll jump up and shout
If you haven't why don't you go shopping today
And 'member now that H.E.L.P. 's on its way
H.-E.-L.-P

 My heart was breaking
Till you started making me
Feel like a natural man
My mind was mess
Until you brought happiness
And that's not hard to understand
When I'm through working
Just fussing and cussing
I'll be there just as quick as I can

Here comes the night
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me squeeze me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me love me ooooo

I know living is taking and giving
Baby I'm giving you my best
One of these days you know
I'm going to go crazy
In the middle of your caress
When the day goes down
Honey I'll be around
Why don't you wear your pretty red dress


Every morning our love is reborn
And it lives with me all day long
Things start changing
Take as a little rearranging
But our love grows on and on
Stars who shine in love
Are making you mine to love
I've never felt a love so strong




 Here she comes
Breathing life in to my thoughts
There she goes
Leaves a portrait in my soul
Rolling in madness
She does everything to me
Wherever she goes you know the devil dances
And the gods lay down in defeat

Am I living
Crazy woman can't you see
That I'm giving
Giving to you can you dig
Me

I want to live
To learn the truth before my door
Don't you know
I'm a simple man for all I know
This might be the hard way
But it's easier for me
To take all the changes that are always amazing
But to never let them fence me in


Me I'm only searching for the things I really need
I can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds
I started out on empty promise I was living on my dreams
I was a runaway son and now I'm up out of the water
And I can barely barely breathe

Rolling down the road
Listen listen
Hear the music play
Listen listen
Hear the music play yeah
Listen listen
Hear the music play
Listen listen
Hear the music play

It's here and gone so fast
Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were
She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long
You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast




 I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for lost and gone
And unknown for a long long time
Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Of the heroes and villains
Once at night catillian squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Heroes and villains
Just see what you've done
Stand or fall I know there
Shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair
Of my life with the heroes and villains

You know they suddenly rise
They started so long ago
Head to toe, healthy weathy and wise

So long to the city

To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm alright

Heroes and villains

 Hey, little tomboy, sit here on my lap
I got things that I gotta tell you
No more skateboards, put away your baseball mitt
Your rough living days are through
You could find places to go
You could see that boys love you so
They're doing it all over the world

Hey little hey little hey little tomboy
Time to turn into a girl
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy
They're doing it all over the world

Hey, little tomboy, I've had my eyes on you
Thinking what a girl you could be
Mmm, I smell perfume, let's try some cut-off jeans
Look at all the changes I see
I'm going to teach you to kiss
You're going to feel just like this
They're doing it all over the world




 Hold on dear Brother
Oh Brother
Ooooo

Tried to close my eyes
To all around me
Oh no you just can't escape
If I lose one friend
Will I still have you

Won't you please
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Oh Brother
Ooooo

What can I love that isn't you
But you never understand inside of me
Till you realize a look
You never get more than you took


In your heart you know it love
A simple feeling that you shout
I want your love
You touch my hand
I need your love
To carry me home

Hold on dear Brother




 Whisperin' winds send my wind chimes a-tinklin'

 Honking honking down the gosh darn highway
Trying trying to get past them cars
Got a got a little date with an angel
She's the one that said she'd go with me
To see a little movie tonight
(Honk honk honking down the highway)
Her folks told me that she's lonely
And she loves me only
She's used to running away from guys
Praying praying that she'll hold me tight (hoo!)
And hoping hoping that she'll see the light
Who cares if I got to spend my money
Even if I have to act funny
To go and steal her heart away
(Honk honk honking down the highway)
Take it one little inch at a time now
Until we're feeling fine now
I guess I've got a way with girls

Honk honk honking down the highway
Take it one little inch at a time now
Until we're feeling fine now
I guess I've got a way with girls

Praying praying that she'll hold me tight (yeah)
(Honk honk honking down the highway)
And hoping hoping that she'll see the light
(Honk honk honking down the highway)
Who cares if I gotta spend the night
(Honk honk honking down the highway)

 Oh we was dancing in a really big city
Got excited by the sound of a party
Now my heart beat while the music was grooving
And if you wanted to you couldn't keep from moving
Look around do you believe what you seeing
The walls are moving the ceiling's a-reeling
Couples over in the corner romancing
Oh the boys are with me to do some outta sight dancing
Gotta girl giving me some lessons
And now she's gonna be my confession
Aren't you glad we found our way in here
Put another record up on the player
Hey there's a stoned party dancing with the police
Don't have to worry about disturbing the peace
Met a fine chick that really got to me
Good Lord how she boogalooed to me
Oh my how she boogalooed it to me
Come on sock it sock it to me




 Play it like it is, Carl!
Pick it up from the third!)
(Ha!)

Well, there's a dance spreading round like an awful disease
Hully, hully gully
You just shake your shoulders and you wiggle your knees
(Play it like it is!)
Hully, hully gully

Well, there's a dance spreading round from coast to coast
Hully, hully gully
Well, when me and my baby do it, that's how we do it the most
Hully, hully gully

Mama hully gully
Papa hully gully
Baby hully gully, too

Well, I went to a party now and what did they do?
Hully, hully gully
Well now everybody's doing it on their way too
Hully, hully gully
Everybody's looking like they got the shakes
Hully, hully gully
You just wiggle your shoulders, man, that's all it takes
Hully, hully gully

(Let's tear them down!)

Hully, hully gully
Do it with your left shoulder
Hully, hully gully
Do it with your other shoulder, now
Hully, hully gully
Switch your blades
Hully, hully gully
Mama hully gully
Papa hully gully
Baby hully gully too
(How about "Me and My Girl"?)

Mama hully gully
Papa hully gully
You can hully gully too

(Whoa!)
(That's all ...)
(What do you know?)
(Before we bring on the star of our show this evening...)
(What else do you know?)
(Uh, he knows...)

 Ahhhhhh oooooo

This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Loving you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again


I hear the music all the time, yeah
I hear the music, hold me tight now baby
I hear the music all the time
I hear the music
I hear the music (baby)
Ahhhhh




 I'm doing this and I'm doing that
And I'm a-walking the floor
I drink a little of this and eat a little that
And poke my head out the door
I get thinking I'm wasting the night away
I wouldn't mind if I could get with you right away
Oh honey don't know how long it's been
But this feeling's building up inside again
I wash the dishes and I rinsed up the sink
Like a busy bee
I make up a song as I'm a-working along
No one's watching me
I wish that you were here to help me dry
When's the last time you baked me a pie
You had a way of making it come alive
It's not too late for you to take a drive

(Baah ba ba ba baah ba ba)
(Baah ba ba ba baah ba ba)

It's not too late
I'd love just once to see you 
In the nude




 Well I've gone steady with a-lots of girls
And to all of them I tried to be true
But I'm so glad I never promised them
What I promised you

And that's I do (I do, yes I do)
Take you (take you, I'll take you)
For my wife (for my, for my wife)
For the rest of my life (ah yes the rest of my life)

Well I heard from my folks
Time and time again
To make sure that I found the right one
And every time you meet
Your heart will beat
And you'll want to say




 When you say you do
Makes me want to spend life with you
I never knew life could be so good
When you say you care

Want to be right there beside you
And show the world
You've been good to me
And you know I do

All my love
You are my love
Without your love I go nowhere
All my love
You are my life
You are the girl I'm dreaming of
You're the one I really love
I do love you

When you say it's true
Lets me know we'll be forever
Insightful joy
Of a love so good



I do love you

 Five long days and I'm tired of working
I'm going to see my boss today
In fifteen minutes I'll be on the train
'Cause I just got my pay
Now I could take and sock away my dough
And make me six percent a year
But it's not much fun to wait around for that
When I can spend it while it's here
Ah
Let's get dressed up
And see a movie
I like spending my money
And I like having a good time
Good times sure make me happy
And I'm so happy
'Cause I just got my pay
Monday morning I'm up and at it
Those last two days were good for my soul
It's time to do my working thing
I'm late so I got to roll
My take home comes to 'bout ninety-five
And my boss is giving me some praise
If it weren't for me the place would fall apart
I think I'll hit him up for a raise
(Hit 'im up get a rais)
Ah
Let's get undressed
And climb in bed too
I like spending my money
And I like having a good time
Good times sure make me happy
And I'm so happy
'Cause I just got my pay
Dada dada da
Dadada
Da da da da da
Dadada




 I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind
They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found
Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin' for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)
Sometimes I feel very sad
(Can't find nothin' I can put my heart and soul into)

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
(x6)
I guess I just wasn't made for these times




 I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive?

I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through their day
And waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that their lives could be better

I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

Now how can I come on
And tell them the way that their lives could be better

I know there's an answer
I know now but I have to find it by myself

 I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams

I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams




 I'll bet he's nice
I'll bet he's twice
As nice as me and it makes me cry
Because I remember you and I
Please don't tell me if it's true
Because I'm still in love with you
Pretty darling you my pretty darling
You pretty darling you my pretty darling

I'll bet he's sweet
(Bed eh oooo)
I'll bet he's neat
(Bed eh oooo)
I'll bet he's funny and that ain't all
I'll bet he shows you quite a ball
Please don't tell me if it's true
Because I'm still in love with you
Pretty darling you my pretty darling
You pretty darling you my pretty darling
Baby
Don't you ever tell me that you're leaving
Now that you got me to believe in
You are the sunshine and the flower
Come on and make my every hour


Well it's you
You my darling

 I'm bugged at my old man
Because he's making me stay in my room
(Darn my dad)
I came in a little late
And my old man he just blew his mind
(Blew it bad)
Why did he sell my surfboard?
He cut off my hair in my sleep
I wish I could see outside
But he tacked up boards on my window
(Gosh it's dark)
I can't hit the surf, can't drag
Can't do a dog-goned thing
(Wish I could)
I tried to call up my chick
But he jerked my phone right out of the wall
They gave me some breadcrumbs
And a little glass of water
And they're out there eating steak
(Smells so good)
I ripped up my wardrobe
And I'm growing a beard
Oh when will they let me come out
I'd listen to my radio
But he took it and he's using it in his own room
(Now it's gone)
I wish I could do some homework
But I got suspended from school
(Blew my cool)
I'm bugged at my old man
And he doesn't even know where it's at




 Freshened air around my head
Mornings tumble out of bed
Eggs and grits and lickety-split
Look at me jump
I'm in the great shape of the agriculture




 I'm so lonely
Really, really so lonely
I wish that you'd come comfort me whoa
I'm so broken-hearted
Since we've been parted

I've wished since you went away
That you'd soon be back to stay
I'm so lonely for your love tonight

Since you left, it's been this way
Every night and every day
When will it
When will it ever change whoa

 As soon as he turned it on
The wind outside of his room
Stirred up for a few seconds
He thought to himself
"I'll climb out my window
And go sit out there with my radio"
Out the window he went
Sitting against a small stump
Behind some flowerbeds
The light from his bedroom window he could still see
The music of Bach was playing
After a while it began to sound distant
As the young prince gazed at this radio on his knee
The music was floating away from his hearing
What could be happening
He took it off of his knee
And put the radio to his ear
Nothing happened
Then the transistor left his hands
And was floating in the mid-air
Two feet off the ground
As the prince laughed
It suddenly turned around
And it was light green phosphorous in colour
Dancing back and forth
The magic transistor
Started moving down his path
He could hear the sound out
Like nothing he had ever heard before
The trees were getting closer together
And flowers glowed with tinges of magic light
As he followed thinking to himself
"What's going on?"
The transistor lifted slowly
Up to the top of a little tree
And sat there
While it slowly became louder
To where the prince could hear it clearly
Fireflies shot across the path in front of the prince
He turned around and couldn't see the light from his window
There he was watching all alone all by himself
He got a hunch to get back to his room
And he turned and ran right back




 (Hello I'm the Pied Piper from the far away land of Night)
(Nobody knows anything about my existence)
(I only want to know kids)
(Late at night when people are sleeping)
(I go into their old radios and turn them into magic transistors)
(And fly outside with them)
(I come from such a far away land of Night)
(That I'm fascinated with the funny music I hear on your radios)
(You are the first to know of me)
(You can't see me I'm hidden)
(But you can see the green glow I make)
(I heard you laugh last night)
(I figured that you would be amused by me)
(Listen to this)

(Bow bow)
(I'm the Pied Piper)
(Bow bow bow bow bow)
(In the radio)

Then the prince heard something he never knew could be


The hidden Pied Piper was laughing


As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on


When the music died down the Piper said that "every night


After midnight if you leave your on your transistor radio


I'll promise to bring more magic music to you


No one" he said " will ever believe you so why tell of me to anyone?


You are my only friend of night" said the Pied Piper "and I'll talk to
You again some night"


Then the radio was glowing no more
As it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince
He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed
That night he dreamt all night
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper
The prince did try what the Piper said to do
But for weeks at night
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night
"That Pied Piper must have been joking" he said
"There's nothing but Bach on this radio
I'm going to throw it back up in the attic for good"
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud
That two of his brothers overheard him
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned
It on
(Dom dom kingdom)
There it was the music had to be from the Pied Piper himself

(My radio is radiating through the)
(Dom dom kingdom)
(Through the misty night)
(Through the misty night)

(Dom dom kingdom)
The prince's sisters ran in their brother's room
(My radio is radiating through the)
(Dom dom kingdom)
And they were all dancing and screaming with joy
(Through the misty night)
(Through the misty night)
But the transistor was playing too loud
And their mother heard it
(Dom dom kingdom)
"What are you doing there? What is that you're listening too?
Give me that radio at once" she said




 As soon as he turned it on

Stirred up for a few seconds

 I came along when he broke your heart
That's when you needed someone
To help forget about him
I gave you love with a brand new start
That's what you needed the most
To set your broken heart free

I know you cried, and you felt blue
But when I could I gave strength to you
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again

I kissed your lips
And when your face looked sad
It made me think about him
And that you still loved him so
But you know that pretty soon
I made you feel glad
That you belonged to me
And love began to show

He hurt you then, but that's all done
I guess I'm saying you're the only one
I'm waiting for the day when you can love again 

You didn't think that I could sit around and let him work
You didn't think that I could sit around and let (watch) him take you
You didn't think that I could sit around and let him go
You didn't think that I could sit back and let you go
You didn't think




 When I'm behind the wheel
Horses of gas and steel
The highway is my home
In fiberglass and chrome
Fantasy car shiny Corvette
Let's take a ride you can't forget
Come on pretty lady ride with me

In my car
I'm captain of my destiny
In my car
Pretty babe come cruise with me

Come for a drive
And we'll arrive
Feeling alive

I'm master of my fate
When I accelerate
My new Vette is my throne
When on the road we roam we roam we roam roam
Cruising like we're in a dream
Feeling like we're still sixteen
Being a part of the great American scene



Cruise cruise cruise with me baby
Now move move up in the stratosphere
Zoom zoom zoom with me darling now
We're still cruising after all these
Cruising after all these years
Wind blowing in my hair
I feel like a millionaire
Radio is blasting strong
We're breaking out in song
Blazing trails both near and far
Park my car behind a star
Life is full of possibilities




 There's a world where I can go
And tell my secrets to
In my room
In my room
In this world I lock out
All my worries and my fears
In my room
In my room
Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday
Now it's dark and I'm alone
But I won't be afraid
In my room
In my room




 There's a world where
I can go and
Tell my secrets to

Lock out all my
Worries and my fears

In my room, in my room

Tell my secrets to
In my room

Lock out all my
Worries and my fears

In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room

 I'm blessed with everything
A world to which a man can cling
So happy times when I break out in tears
In the back of my mind I still have my fears
I live my life with her
Love her true she knows I'm sure
I make her happy just living so plain
In the back of my mind I'm afraid it's going to change
I tried to run far way from thoughts
I should try to keep away
But they just keep coming back to me
I tried to rationalize
But some day I might realize
That things are just good the way they'll be
I know it's so hard to find
A girl who really understands your mind
What will I do if I leave her
It will always be way in the back of my mind




 Ooooooo woooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooooo oooo oooo
Dow dow
Ooooo
Ahhhhh ahhhhh
Ooo

We're always first to hit the lot
And wave to the man in blue now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
It's still so early in the morning
The grass is all covered with dew now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)
She's turning on the radio dial
We can sit a listen for awhile
She looks so great in the morning
She doesn't even have to try now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
It's not my metal flake paint that
The guys are digging when they pass by now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)
Outside it could storm
But we'll still keep warm
All the kids are splitting to their lockers
But we're still making out in the car now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run de)
Just one long kiss and we'll be gone
'Cause two minutes all there are now
(Doo run de run de doo run de run)
Here comes the news
There's no time to lose

 Hey Adam, you'll never guess what I saw last night
What?
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus. That's right
Oh no
They were listening to music, and their voices were low
And he looks a lot like someone that you and I both know!
Who?
Well, I saw Santa rockin' round the Christmas tree
And Mama was as close to Santa as you are to me
They filled up the socks
But before he could go
They started to kiss
Santa just couldn't go
Well, I saw Mama help Santa decorate the tree
With little bitty presents and candy canes for you and me
He started to leave...
Mm!
Then he turned around
I made a noise
*Clunk*
I was sure to be found!
Well, I saw Mama kissin' Santa 'neath the mistletoe
Yeah, and he looked like someone I thought you oughta know




 (Just groovy.)
(Beatle?)
(What is it, what is it?)
(No--hey, faster)
(It's Paul. Paul is the...)
(Who?)
(Paul!)

I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do
(Faster!)
Woah-oh I should have realized what a kiss could be
That this could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oo oo oo oo
Bow bow bow
And when I ask you to be mi-i-i-ine
You're going to say you love me too
You love me too
(Harmonics!)
You love me too
(Great. Now, "Tell Me Why." How does that go? That's my favorite Beatles song.)
(One more time. Tell me why.)
(Who knows.)
(Hey, 7Up! I want some 7Up.)
(Hey, I got some.)
(Over here, I want some ice cubes!)




 Do you ever get the feeling that you got to get away
It's a symptom of the fever all across the u.s.a
My family doctor told me "son the flu is what you have"
But i know it's island fever and i got it real bad

Hey doc i need a pain reliever
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
I got it bad i got the island fever
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever

She might have got it from her travel brochure now
(Oooo i got it bad)

(Bow bow bow ooo)
Come on baby wouldn't it be nice (bow bow bow ooo)
If i could take you down to paradise (bow bow bow ooo)
Sweet little mama gotta get away (bow bow bow ooo)
Your daddy knows a little hideaway (bow bow bow ooo)

Hey girl i got some good advice
Drive your dad mad and
Make him take you down to paradise

I've been picking up a love vibration
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
Coming from a little island nation
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
For my own self-preservation
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
Better make a quick reservation
(Oooo i got it bad)


Hey girl i got some good advice
Drive your dad mad and
Make him take you down to paradise

Bom bom bom ba ba bom bom bom bom
I went to Trinidad
I didn't know just what I had
Til I found her
She wears a pretty smile
That compliments her shapely style
And I found her
Island girl, she's oh so pretty
Island girl, I like her plenty
Island girl, I'm gonna make her mine
Island girl, she make me happy
Island girl, she kinda sassy
Island girl, I'm gonna make her mine
Everybody's got an island fantasy
For me it's like a Caribbean odyssey
All the people live and love there by the sea
Near the sparkling water 'neath the coco-palm tree
Island girl, she make me happy
Island girl, she kinda sassy
Island girl, won't you show me the way
She's fine, so fine, all mine
She's so good to me
And I know (I know) our love (our love) so free (so free)
That it was meant to be
Island girl, she make me happy
Island girl, she kinda sassy
Island girl, won't you show me the way
She's a real beauty from the Caribbean
Long dark hair flowin' in the breeze
She's the kinda beauty makes you come alive and
We can live together for eternity
Every now and then I get this silly grin
When I'm there in her company
She says I'm crazy, that I'm also very lazy
I know she loves me
Island girl, she make me happy
Island girl, she kinda sassy
Island girl, won't you show me the way
Island girl, won't you show me the way

 After it's all been said
The music spinning in our head
Can't forget the feeling of
The magic of that summer in love
Ooh, I wanna take you there
Do you wanna turn back the pages
Memories and photographs
The world has changed
And yet the game
Is still the same

Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time, oh-oh-oh
Isn't it time
Whoa

The good times never have to end
And now's the time to let them happen again
And we can have ourselves a blast
The good times they, aren't only in the past

Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time, oh-oh-oh
Isn't it time
Whoa

And as the sun goes down
We raise our glass to kindness
To all the good times we shared
Isn't it time we get ready and then
Isn't it time we go steady again

Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly

 Ooooooooow
Livin' down in L.A
Such A Beautiful day
Whoa whoa

The skies are clear
It's a beautiful day in L.A
People in motion
Our wheels moving all kind a ways
Indoors, outdoors, in the sun
There are people everywhere having fun, fun, fun
And when the moon and stars come out at night
We'll know what to do when we turn out the lights
(turn out the lights, out the lights)
The freeways there are jammed with all kind of folks on their bikes
With fastball surfers, they're all doing their lefts and their rights
Roller skating, jogging, or a fancy bike
You can get around most anyway you really like
And when the sun is down and the stars are bright
I can hardly wait to get to hold you tight
(hold you tight, hold you tight)


Riding the fastlanes, and ballet in leisurely flight
People in motion the streets there a beautiful sight
In good times, sunshine, you'll feel alright
We'll maybe even do an afternoon delight
You're sure to get as high as the clouds above
Participating in this little dance of love (dance of love, dance of love)


The freeways are jammed now
The cars have disappeared from the scene
Because gone to work or to play
They use a whole another kind of machine




 I used to be a famous artist
Proud as I could be
Struggling to express myself
For the whole world to see
I used to blow my mind sky high
Searching for the lost elation
Little did I know the joy I was to find
In knowing I am only me

I'm singing in my heart
I'm singing, love to sing
I love to sing it from my heart

Oh, the creation yeah
Of a good time doing my part
With an open-hearted laugh of realization in my mind
And now I'm but a child who art
Erect in humility
Serving out a love for everyone I meet
In truth who are really me


No, no, no, no, no
It's about time now
Don't you know now
It's about time now
Don't you know now
It's about time we get together
To be out front and love one another
Brothers, sisters, everybody
We better start to help each other now
We need it now

When we're sharing our love, brother
That's when we know we can shape another world
Oh no lord no no oh




 It's getting late
I can't wait
Come-a-come-a little closer
You got to tell me that you'll stay

I've been praying for this moment
Since the second I laid eyes on you
Minutes seem like hours
When you're gone
Girl I'm getting tired of waiting
So stop your hesitating
I can't believe you keep me hanging on
It's getting late-ate-ate-ate
Ooo (it's getting late)
Time waits for no one
Love is a turn on


You got me in a situation
My love is rising high
Don't let any more love pass us by
Girl, we can make it up to paradise
Just give it a try
So hurry now and girl make up your mind

It's getting late
Don't know how much more I can stand

Girl I need your loving
I'm so tired of waiting
Come on there's no one else around
Ooo sweet girl it's getting late
So please don't hesitate
Been waiting to get your defenses down




 Darling I'm lost without you
Sad with nothing to do
It's just a matter of time

Whoa darling
What is it you're doing
What's that mood that's brewing
It's just a matter of time

When we went our seperate ways for the first time
I was sure that it would be the last time


It's just a matter of time




 Fun is in, it's no sin, it's that time again
To shed your load, hit the road on the run again
Summer skies in our eyes and a warmer sun
It's one for all, all for one, all for all out fun

Got to go to it
Going to go through it
Got to get with it

Looking good
Down the hood Of a funky ride
On the way
To the tide
Just to tan your hide
In the shade
Lemonade
In the sun ocean spray
To get your face
In the race
Or lay back's no disgrace


It's OK to get out there and
Have some fun
By yourself maybe
Or else with a special one
Good or bad
Glad or sad
It's all going to pass
So it's OK
Let's all play
And enjoy it while it lasts


Find a ride
(In the sum-sum-summertime)




 The flame of love we had has finally died
Can't take this emptiness it left inside
It's over now
And though I played the role I lost my soul
It's still within your heart
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me
The noise outside my window carries on
Like distant bugles love is very gone
It's over now
It took a part of me, the heart of me
To watch it fade away
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me
Heaven
Heaven is far away
Angels no longer play
I need to take this fear and force it down
And just pretend that you are not around
It's over now
I'll put a Frank Sinatra album on
And cry my blues away
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me




 Instrumental




 I love to pick you up
Because you're still a baby to me
Cribs and cradles and bottles and toys
Are part of the joys they bring
I want to wash your face
And change your clothes and button your shoes
Walk you around and wrestle with you
Then I'm going to make you sing
In the morning I could wake you up
Feed you breakfast from a little cup
I want to pick you up
Rock you back and forth and make you smile
I want to hold you close for a while
I want to tickle your feet
Drop you in your little tub
Wash your body and shampoo your hair
Be careful not to sting your eyes
When it's night I'll put you in your bed
And I'll bend and kiss you on your head
I want to pick you up
Rock you back and forth and make you smile
I want to hold you close for a while

Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt butt
She's going to sleep be quiet
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt
She's going to sleep
Little baby go to sleep




 (Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I was born in Little Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in han-an-an-an-and
I wore high-top shoes and shirt-tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Don't you know my Papa dis'proved
My Mama hooo-ooo-hoooed it
But I told them time and time again

(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Don't you know I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey hey hey

(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grows sweeter through the years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years

(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey hey hey

(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
My little baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee-high to a chimp
And the love bug bit me
And I have to be with her a thousand years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
If the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
I know I'll still be standing there

(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her
Hey hey hey

(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)




 I took a walk and sat down in a park
The gardener walked out and the sprinklers went on
They watered the lawn and I went to sleep

Ten thirty I turned my radio on
Some group was playing a musical song
It wasn't too long and I went to sleep

Again at the park on a nice summer day
High up above me the trees gently sway
A bird flew away and I went to sleep

 He came from Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods up near the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell
Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunney sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad tracks
Engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
And people passing by would stop and say
My my but that little country boy can play
Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Goode




 He sits behind his microphone
John-ny Car-son
He speaks in such a manly tone
John-ny Car-son

Ed McMahon comes on and says "Here's Johhny"
Every night at eleven thirty he's so funny
It's (nice) to (have) you (on) the (show) tonight
I've seen (your) act (in) Vegas out of sight

When guests are boring he fills up the slack
John-ny Car-son
The network makes him break his back
John-ny Car-son

Ed McMahon comes on and says "Here's Johhny"
Every night at eleven thirty he's so funny
Don't (you) think (he's) such (a) natural guy
The (way) he's (kept) it (up) could make you cry

Who's a man that we admire?
Johnny Carson is a real live wire
Who's a man that we admire?
Johnny Carson is a real live wire
Who's a man that we admire?
Johnny Carson is a real live wire
Who's the man that we admire?
Johnny Carson is a real live wire

Judy, it's gettin' stronger every day
Oh Judy, I felt it's you in every way
My Judy, that's why you're always here to stay
I love you so
I want you to know
I can't let you
Give me a chance to show
Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear
Then Judy, tell me that you really care
Well Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear
Please Judy, tell me that you really care




 I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right. I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! Gas! Gas
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! Gas! Gas
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! Gas! Gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash




 There's a lot of things I want
A lot of things that I'd like to be
But girl I don't foresee
A rags to riches story for me
I've given up on schemes
Because everyone fell through
I've given up so many things
Don't ask me to give up on you

And baby, baby
Just once in my life
Let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down

Just once in my life
Let me hold onto
A good thing I found
Don't let me down
Baby, say that you'll be staying

I couldn't face the day
If you weren't here by my side
And if you went away
Then I'd be left without any pride
There's just one little dream
I've got to make come true
There's just one round I've got to win
I can't be a loser with you



Every pot of gold
Ain't so easy to find
And if you'll stand by me
Girl, I'll give you some of mine
I can't give you the world
But I'll work hard for you girl
Well, I'll work hard
Every day
Baby, don't leave me
Now say you won't leave me
Do this for me, baby




 Keep an eye on Summer this year
Keep an eye on Summer
Keep an eye on

We said goodbye last September
Your words I still can hear

Those things I say in my letters
You'll find them most sincere
Keep an eye on Summer this year-ear-ear
Soon we'll be graduating
And we'll be so far apart
And though you could be dating
I'm waiting and waiting
And as we look at the future
Though it be through a tear




 When it's ice cream weather get the gang back together
Roll down your windows and ride
They'll be sleeping in the sand dunes dancing in the streets
They're just trying to keep the summer alive

They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Sum-sum-summer alive)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Ah keep the summer)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Sum-sum-summer alive)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Try to keep the summer)

When it's ice cream weather all the girls will look better
The boys try to give them a ride
To the one last party before the school bell rings
They're just trying to keep the summer alive


Lay down in the sun
And watch the clouds roll by
And being with the one you love
In the summertime

When it's last September back in school we'll remember
The cure for the wintertime blues
Grab your girl hit the road head on down to the beach
You'll be coming home with sand in your shoes


Keep the summer alive
(yeah yeah uh huh I know we'll keep the summer)
We'll just
(Yeah yeah uh huh I know we'll keep the summer)
Keep the summer alive
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Yeah yeah uh huh I know we'll keep the summer)
Yeah trying to keep the summer alive
(Yeah yeah uh huh I know we'll keep the summer)




 Please don't let me argue anymore
I won't make you worry like before
Can't remember what we fought about
Late late last night we said it was over
But I remember when we thought it out
We both had a broken heart

Woah Baby
(Kiss me Baby
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you
Woah Baby
(Kiss me baby
Woah Baby
(Love to hold you

As I drove away I felt a tear
It hit me I was losing someone dear
Told my folks I would be alright
Tossed and I turned, my head was so heavy
Then I wondered as it got light
Were you still awake like me?

There's a place called Kokomo

 It's been my secret passion to try it
In Captain Cook fashion, I can't deny it
I want to spend my winters on the Kona coast in Hawaii
For years I saved my pennies and planned it
The great Pacific Ocean we'll span it
I want to go surfing where I dig it the most, in Hawaii

(Go to Hawaii)
Hawaiian islands beckon (Hawaii)
And I'll be back here someday, I reckon
And pretty island girls greet you with a flower lei
You'll throw it back into the sea
Hoping you be coming back to Hawaii

Suntanned beauties are everywhere
Lovely island ladies with long dark hair
You're sure to find a honey waiting for you there in Hawaii
Kani and Wahini and Wahowalis, too
Get a friendly aloha from this mecca to you
They're the friendliest people anywhere in Hawaii

(Go to Hawaii)
Welcome to the island mecca. (Hawaii)
I'll learn to talk like a local, I betcha
And at Lahaina look out for shooting stars
We'll watch them fall into the sea
And it will be just you and me in Hawaii

Winter in the sun and surf would sure be nice
In a south sea garden of paradise
I want to spend my summer on the Kona coast in Hawaii

(Honolulu, Waikiki, do you want to come along with me?)
(Waimia up to Hanalai, love to take you to the islands today)




 Lady lady lady lady

Won't you come here and lie lady Lynda with me
We can lie in the green canyon meadows
And we'll hear the birds sing in the spring

Don't you know if you'll stay lady Lynda with me
We can talk about love everafter
When you lie lady Lynda with me

Lynda, won't you say that we can be near
Cannot deny there've been hard times
Darling, evolution is drawing us near
Look in my eyes whoa
Lynda, won't you say that I am your man
Don't look surprised, it's all in his plan
But darling, evolution is drawing us near
Lie lady lie
Oooh lady won't you lie lady

Now won't you stay lady Lynda with me
We can talk about love everafter
When you lie lady Lynda with me

Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you ooh lady won't you stay lady with me
When you lie lady Lynda

Come along with me
Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you lie with me
Darling you know you make my heart sing
Won't you come along and sing a song
Sing the sound of love
Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you lie with me
Darling your love is like the coming spring
Won't you come along and sing a song
Sing the song my love
Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you lie with me Darling your love is like the coming spring
Won't you come along and sing a song
Sing the song my love
Ohh lady won't you lie lady
Won't you lie with me
Darling your love is like the coming spring
Won't you come along and sing a song
Sing the song my love
Ooh lady won't you lie lady won't you marry me




 Where the sea breeze
Sways the palm trees
Paradise awaits
And so does she
Reliving love
That was like a romance
From a page in history
It was the last place
That he stopped at
On the way back to his boat
She was dancing
Met his glancing
Like they say
"It was all she wrote"

You know i want to
But i can't stay (bye bye)
Girl you know i'm gonna sail away (sail away)
When the wind comes up
And when the sun goes down
I'll say "goodbye" to this old island town
Out on the water where the full moon shines
You and lahaina always on my mind

They left the dance floor
So they could spend more
Precious time near the water side
It wasn't wrong
And it wasn't right
They were two ships
Passing in the night

You know i want to
But i can't stay (bye bye)
Girl you know i'm gonna sail away (sail away)
When the wind comes up
And when the sun goes down
I'll say "goodbye" to this old island town
I think about you when the full moon shines
Lahaina always on my mind 




 Lana Lana oh Lana dear
Please come along with me

We'll go (Lana dear) we'll go (Lana dear)
So far away (Lana dear) (Lana dear)
So happy (Lana dear) we will be (Lana dear)
I'll show (come with me) I'll show (come with me)
You another world (come with me) (come with me)
Alone (come with me) with silver (come with me) and gold (Lana dear)
Don't dear (Lana dear) please don't (Lana dear)
Don't be afraid (Lana dear) (Lana dear)
It's heaven (Lana dear) I've been told (Lana dear) (Lana dear)

Lana (come with me) Lana (come with me) Oh Lana dear (come with me)
Please (come with me) come along (come with me) with me (Lana dear)




 I've been overseas for almost a year
Any time now precious land should appear
I've been away from my lover so long
Look there matey, but I could be wrong

Oh land ahoy, land ahoy, sailor boy
(Land ahoy land ahoy Papa's toy l'ahoy)
Oh land ahoy, land ahoy, sailor boy
(Land ahoy land ahoy Papa's toy l'ahoy)
Oh land ahoy, land ahoy, sailor boy
(Land ahoy land ahoy Papa's toy l'ahoy)
Oh land ahoy, land ahoy, sailor boy
(Land ahoy land ahoy Papa's toy l'ahoy)

Listen here matey, in an hour or so
We'll be sitting on the land that we know
We'll leave this ship and run to outstretched arms
And soon we'll be living with our lover's charms




 I long to see you oh my love
I want to feel you near
My need is deep inside
Well I've been rolling on, I've been holding on, I'd like you to know
That it's been a long, long time
Sometimes it's hard to make it through the day
Sometimes it's hard to find my way
Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days
When your friends have all gone
Leaving this town for another one
The night is coming round
I can feel the weight of coming down
So afraid to lose this dream
I want you to understand that I'm trying to do the best I can
It's so easy to lose my way
Lay your head where you may find some peace
I've been searching for my happiness
Don't you want to wake up and take my love
I'd be happy if you'd let me know
Should I stay or go
Let me know
Woke from a dream to see reflections all around me, of new realities
Heavenly angels won't you guide me please help me to decide the path most
Meant for me




 When I watched you walk with him
Tears filled my eyes
And when I heard you talk with him
I couldn't stand his lies
And now before he tries it
I hope you realize it

Let him run wild
He don't care
Let him run wild
He'll find out
Let him run wild
He don't care

(Guess you know I waited for you)
He'll do the same to other girls
That he did to you
But then one day he'll run in to one
That's going to hurt him too
Before he makes you over
I'm gonna take you over


(Guess you know I waited for you girl)
All the dreams you shared with him
You might as well forget
I know you need a truer love
And that's what you'll get
And now that you don't need him
Well he can have his freedom

 Alright, right now
Everytime we've been here
We've asked you to do one thing for us
And that, that one thing is to help us out
And yell something
Alright
And the thing we want you to yell
Three words"let's go trippin'"
We want you to yell out on the count of three OK?
One, Two, Two-and-a-half, Three
LET'S GO TRIPPIN'!
Yeah, baby!
Instrumental
Thank you
Thank you very much




 I don't want to tell you that I care for you
And have you just ignore me
It's better that I wait and see just how you feel
And maybe you'll adore me
I know you've had so much experience
That you don't need another person in your life
I know it may sound funny
But you're the kind of woman
Who'd make a very sweet wife
Take your time, don't worry how you feel because
You know we've got forever
Maybe I'll come up with some idea and
You'd think that I was clever
I've never had someone I need someone
To live with and be good to
Don't worry about your past loves
And if they've never understood you
Let's put our hearts together
And say we'll leave each other never
Let's see what we can cook up between us

Together
Together
Together you and I




 Let the wind blow
Let the grass grow
But don't let her go

Don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life

Let the moon glow
(Let the moon glow)
(On the fallen snow)
On the fallen snow
(Let the moon glow)
(On the fallen snow)

But I just got to know
(Let me please know oh oh oh)
Know she'll be a part of my life
Know she'll be a part of my life
Forever
Let the bees make honey
Let the poor find money
Take away their sorrows
Give them sunshine tomorrow

But don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her tell me now

Let the bird sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall
Let the grass grow
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow

But don't take her out of my life
Please keep her a part of my life

 To get to you baby I went through the wringer
Ain't going to let you slip through my fingers
Going to school isn't my fondest desire
But sitting in class you set my soul on fire
God please let us go on this way
All day long I practised what to say-ay
I think about this game that I like to play-ay
When I leave you I'm so depressed
'Because you're my only happiness
God please let us go on this way
Seems we have extra-sensory perception
You can send me thoughts I'd have no objection
Now we can fly high in the sky
We'll live forever, we'll never die

God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God don't let her slip through my fingers
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way-ay




 Little bird up in a tree
Looked down and sang a song to me
Of how it began

Na na na na

The trout in the shiny brook
Gave a worm another look
And told me not to worry
About my life


Tree in my own backyard
Stands all alone
Bears fruit for me
And it tastes so good
Where's my pretty bird?
He must have flown away
If I keep singing
He'll come back someday
Dawn, bird's still gone
Guess I'll go mow the lawn
What a day, what a day
Ooh, what a beautiful day this is




 Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

Well I'm not bragging babe so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When something comes up to me he don't even try
Cause if I had a set of wings man I know she could fly

She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)

Just a little deuce coupe with a flathead mill
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standing still
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
Shell do a hundred and forty with the top end floored


She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip daddy

And coming off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows them out of the water like you never seen
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears

She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

But she'll walk a Thunderbird like (she's) standin' still
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored
Shell do a hundred and forty with the top end floored
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip daddy
And comin' off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows em outta the water like you never seen
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
(My little deuce coupe)
(You don't know what I got)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel!

 So hard to answer future's riddle
When ahead is seeming so far behind
So hard to laugh a child-like giggle
When the tears start to torture my mind
So hard to shed the life of before
To let my soul automatically soar

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Sew up the wounds of evolution
And the now starts to get in my way
So what if life's a revelation
If the mind speaks of only today
So real, the pain of growing in soul
Of climbing up to reality's goal


Long promised road
Trail starts at dawn
Carries on to the season's ending
Long promised road
Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending, never ending

So hard to lift the jewelled sceptre
When the weight turns a smile to a frown
So hard to drink of passion nectar
When the taste of life's holding me down
So hard to plant the seed of reform
To set my sights on defeating the storm


I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you

Trying to find a job to fit my trade
With the morning sun come 'round
Well I'll be covering plenty of ground
And I don't need nobody to pay my aid
Mmmm pay my aid
Now Bess and me were feeling bad
And all the good jobs they were had
I had to take to sweeping up some floors
Well I don't mind that so much
Or the changing of my luck
But you know I could be doing so much more
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip
Well I'll be coming home tonight
Everything will be all right
And we'll be looking at tomorrow

 Love is a woman
So treat her tenderly tonight
Love makes a woman
So give her all your love tonight
A woman is love
And if you're smart
You'll tease her, please her tonight
So take my advice, you just treat her nice
And you'll find that woman is love

1, 2, 3 (2, 3 ahhh) She's falling in love with me
4, 5, 6 (5, 6 ahhh) She fell for all my tricks
7, 8, 9 (8, 9 ahhh) She makes me feel so fine


Love is a woman (dip dip dip)
Love is a woman (dip dip dip Just treat her nice)
Love is a woman (dip dip dip Take my advice)
(dip dip dip And just treat her nice)




 On my own again, left alone
To remember when
Her love filled my life
Made my life alive her love
Love around me

How can I cope without the love
That I had
(all around me, love surrounds me)
Surround me
The love that I lost was more than
I could hope to find
(love surrounds me, all around me)
Around me

Did I have love or did love have me
Oo love around me
But there's no
There's no love of my own

I gave up our love
But it won't disappear
Oo love around me
Desire
Seems as though
Everywhere I go
Oo love around me
Put your arms around me
Hugging and a-kissing
Making the love I've been missing

All around me
But there's no
There's no love of my own

Love around me love surround me, no love of my own 
Love surround me love around me
Put your love around me

 He sat up in his open window
Looking quietly down at the path
A firefly flew in his room and flew right out again
Down jumped the prince
And he went again to find his radio
(Magic transistor radio)
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
As he made his way he could hear something once again
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
There was that transistor up on the same tree
Then from inside of it came a strange voice




 Make it big
So big

You can make it big
You can make it bigger than life
See your name spelled right
Up on the bright lights
Bright lights

Have a little faith in yourself
In everything that you do
I know you're going to make it big if you want to
If you really want to
You can make it big

Bright lights


Baby you're a superstar
Looking like you're going far
Do what you want
Why don't you do what you want to
You could be my little movie queen
Up there on the silver screen
Do what you want
Go on and do what you want to
Catch a plane to Hollywood
And right away you're best buddys
With Johnny B. Goode
And he say
"Baby welcome to the neighborhood"
Now you can do what you want
Do what you wanna







Oh I know you can make it
Everybody you can make it
Yes I know we can make it big
Darling you can make it
I know you're going make it
Oo baby you can make it big




 Ook at me
Funny face
That's not you
A wrinkled nose
A tear
You're crying

Rest your head
Cry on me
Don't be afraid
I'll stay with you
I know you'll make it

And you'll make it good
And you'll make it good
And you'll make it good

All of my life
I haven't known much
All I know
Is what I feel
And what I feel
And what I feel
Love
I'm in love
Love
Love




 Male ego walking down the street
Sees something looking hot and sweet
Hey, baby would you like to meet me tonight?
Male ego is a worldwide game
We love the ladies more than wealth and fame
Lots of girls running through my brain tonight
Male ego is played by all
Chasing ladies and having a ball
Hey girl, I'm going to give you a call tonight
Don't know why we love to chase those tasty ladies
Betcha boys we'll be doing it in our eighties
Male ego's like a game of chance
The gamble starts with just a glance
You're off and running with a new romance tonight
Male ego won't ever quit
It seems to me from where I sit
We ought to do our bit to capture it tonight

You look nice
What's your name?
You smell nice
What's your name?
I like you
What's your name?
I like you
What's your name?
You look nice
What's your name?




 Eat a lot sleep a lot brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot do a lot never be lazy

Never be lazy be lazy

Eat a lot sleep a lot brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot do a lot never be lazy boy
Poof!




 (Hey yeah Marcella)
(Hey yeah Marcella)
She's a bright girl
(Hey yeah Marcella)
Hey hey
(Hey yeah Marcella)

Mystic maiden's more than soft and sexy
She can mess my mind with the stuff that she knows
Her new found beauty goes beyond her covering
And sets a flame in her soul

One arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that'll knock you right over
Ooo Marcella's so sweet


Brave new woman standing proud and dazzling
Grips the goal that eluded her soul
Direction bringing her to now's tomorrow
And my love for her still grows




When she puts one arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that knock you right over
Ooo Marcella's so sweet




 It's been a long, long while
Since we've been strung out on love
And there's no mask of a smile
That can hide what we're thinkin' of
From your heart I hear
Only distant echoes of empty love
I guess this must be the matchpoint of our love
Early in the game when you broke me
Just like a serve (matchpoint matchpoint)
We shoulda walked off the court
But we both didn't have the nerve (matchpoint matchpoint)
So we volleyed a while with small talk
And a smile and as push comes to shove
I'd say this must be the matchpoint of our love

No one ever held me the way you did
No one could ever love me the way you did
How could love slip away from me?

In life's lonely game love too often
Can let you down (matchpoint matchpoint)
And tho' no one's to blame
Love is stil the only game in town (matchpoint matchpoint)
When it's love's last play you can only say by the stars above That this
Must be the match point of our love
Da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matcpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)




 You got me calling at all hours of the night
I don't think it's right
But still I do it
You got me thinking your existence is my life
It's time to see the light
I think I'll leave it

Maybe, I don't know
I tried to take it slow
But I don't know
Maybe, I don't know
But if you say it's so
We can make it go
Maybe, I don't know

Whatever made me think that we could make it good?
Did you think we ever would?
No need in lying
No, no, no
I need your guarantee so I can be assured
Do you ever think you could?
No more depriving
Na-a-na-na-na




 As I sit and close my eyes
There's peace in my mind
And I'm hoping that you'll find it too
And these feelings in my heart
I know, are meant for you

Meant for you




 Round round get around

Get around round round, I get around

Get around round round, I get a square
(Ow!)

I'm getting awfully mad driving down the street
I just don't want to be bugged sitting next to my sweets
Bom bom bom ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta
The other guys are pretty tough
So those other gats over there better not get tough

I get around
Get around round round, I get around

(Rock out, Carl!)
(Anybody)
(Come on, baby!)

We always take my car although it's a heap
And we never get turned down by the chicks we pick up on
Not much...
None of the guys go steady because it wouldn't be Right Guard
To leave their best girls home on a Saturday night

I get around
Get around round round, I get around
From town to town
Get around round round, I get around
I'm a real cool head

(... Carl ...)
(We lost it.)
She's my little deuce coupe
(Hey, Carl.)
You don't know what I got
Talk to me, baby
Well I'm not bragging, babe, so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When something comes up to me he don't even try
Because if I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly
Hey
My little deuce coupe
You don't know what I
Little deuce coupe
Yeah
You don't know what I got
She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
Ah, bom bom bom bom
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing: I got the pink slip daddy
Oh yeah
Da da dom da da dom ba da
(Oh, let's do "Luau"!)
(Talk to me, baby!)
She comes on like a rose, da da dap
(Do the stroll!)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got




 It's been my secret passion to try it
To spend my Christmas surfin', I can't deny it
I wanna spend my Christmas on the Kona Coast in Hawaii
For years I saved my pennies and planned it
The great Pacific Ocean, we'll span it
I wanna spend Christmas where I dig it the most, in Hawaii
Go to Hawaii
Melekalikimaka is "Merry Christmas" in Hawaii talk-a
And at Lahaina we'll count the shooting stars
And it will be just you and me in Hawaii
The suntanned beauties are everywhere
If you're comin' to the islands then you might stare
And find a girl waiting for you there in Hawaii
Kani and Wahini and the haoles, too
Wish a Melekalikimaka to you
They're the friendliest people anywhere in Hawaii
Go to Hawaii
Melekalikimaka is how they say it in island talk-a
The island flower fragrance in the air
We'll write a card and underneath the mango trees
We'll say, "Wish you were here with us in Hawaii"
Winter in the sun and surf'd sure be nice
In a south sea garden paradise
I wanna spend Christmas where I dig it the most, in Hawaii
Honolulu, Waikiki
Do you wanna come along with me?
Waimia up to Hanalai
I'd love to take you to the islands today




 My baby she told me
She don't want to hold me (oh, no!)
And kiss my lips anymore (unh-unh!)
She's going to leave me
And she don't believe me
That I'll be true now
Well maybe she don't love me
And is not thinking of me
But why'd she do it this time of year?
She knows that I'll miss her
And I'll want to kiss her
If just for Christmas

Merry Christmas, baby

Tell me, what did I do
To really convince you
That I'm not the guy anymore?
Take back my ring now
I'll do anything now
But please forgive me

I made my mistake but
I'm willing to wake up
And never mess around anymore
Oh why did we break up?
There's still time to make up
If just for Christmas

Merry Christmas, baby



Merry Christmas, baby




 My baby she told me

How's about an eight o'clock dinner
How's about a nine o'clock movie
Won't it won't it won't it be groovy
Put your loving arms around me
Aren'tcha aren'tcha glad that you found me
Do you do you like fine wine now
Don't it don't it don't it taste fine now
Can'tcha can'tcha can'tcha just hear it
Rock 'n' rock 'n' rock 'n' roll music
Get-a get-a get-a that beat now
Does it does it does it feel neat now
Will you will you will you just kiss me
When you leave me don't you just miss me
Could we could we could we get married
Enough enough enough of going steady
Disco disco discothèque mama
Show me show me show me the boogie
Start a start a start a little dance now
Take a take a take a little chance now
Come on
Listen to "Da Doo Ron Ron" now
Listen to it "Be My Baby"
I know you're going to love Phil Spector




 I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
He did the mash
It caught on in a flash
He did the mash
He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They did the mash
It caught on in a flash
They did the mash
They did the monster mash
The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolf Man
Dracula and his son
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, "The Crypt-Kicker Five"
They played the mash
They played the monster mash
The monster mash
It was a graveyard smash
They played the mash
It caught on in a flash
They played the mash
They played the monster mash
Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist
And said, "Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?"
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
The monster mash
And it's a graveyard smash
It's now the mash
It's caught on in a flash
It's now the mash
It's now the monster mash
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my monster mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you
Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash
The monster mash
And do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash
You'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash
Then you can monster mash

 Holy holy
Halo glowing
Candle burning
Christmas evening
Cold wind blowing
Old Man Winter
Inward glowing
Outside snowing
Morning Christmas
Children love to play
Children laugh
Children love to sing
A Christmas song
Holy holy
Halo glowing
Candle burning
Christmas evening




 (Downbeat, Denny. Denny. Downbeat!)
(What?)
(Get out of here!)
(Oh, man!)
(Oh, rock out!)

Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops falling down the mountainside
Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were in love
High on a mountain of love
Night after night I'm a-standing here alone
Weeping out my heart till the cold grey dawn
Praying that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
(Oh yeah!)
Trying hard to find you somewhere up above
High on a mountain of love

The mountain of love, the mountain of love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should've been ours
That's why I'm so handy, my dream is gone above
High on a mountain of love
(Keep playing it like it is!)
High on a mountain of love

(What, honey?)

(Hahahaha)
Ooh baby...
(That's good.)
One more time. Oooh baby. Ooo
(That's a good voice)




 There was a mansion on a hill
But deep in a secret kingdom
Where a young prince lived
He had four sisters and four brothers
The prince had a special bedroom on the ground floor
With a window that looked down into a deep deep forest
He could see distant lights from other castles in the kingdom
From his window
During the day
He went to school
When it became night
He stayed by himself
Usually in his secret hidden bedroom
One night
While nearly everyone was asleep
He took out of the attic a radio
And he decided to listen to it

 Now that I have lost my Diane
There's no plan as to where to go
It was hard to lose my Diane
Now I just miss her so
Everything is old and nothing is new
All I ever do is think of you
Memories haunt me night and day
(Ahhhhhhhhhhh)
Do you think of me, my Diane
Or have you forgotten me?
Did you think that you were chained down
And now that you are free

Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Shadows hanging over my head
I love you Diane I miss you Diane
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might




 You were my sunshine, my only sunshine
You made me happy when skies were blue
You'll never know, dear, how much I loved you
How could you take my sunshine away?




 You were my sunshine, my only sunshine
You made me happy when skies were blue
You'll never know, dear, how much I loved you
How could you take my sunshine away?




 You were my sunshine, my only sunshine
You made me happy when skies were grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I loved you
How could you take my sunshine away?




 Cease to resist, come on say you love me
Give up your world, come on and be with me
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see

Come on come on, ooo I love you pretty girl
My life is yours, and you can have my world
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see

Never had a lesson I ever learned
I know I could never learn not to love you
Come in now closer
Come in closer closer closer ahhhh

Submission is a gift, give it to your lover
Love and understanding is for one another
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see


Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhhhhh
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhhhhh




 Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

The surfers call him "Noble"
And that's just what he is
He's dedicated to the mighty sea
Surfing night and day
Never twice in one spot
He's something you and I would like to be

Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

He's not afraid of body whop
From ten feet or more
He never backs away from a swell
Hurachis on his feet
Bushy hair on his head
And where he's going he'd never tell


A surfing Cassanova
With his customized board
A Woody and his dirty white jeans
He takes his choice of honeys
Up and down the coast
The finest surfer yet to make the scene




 No-go showboat no-go showboat (no-go showboat)

Well I got a wild custom that wins every show
But it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
Yeah but everybody knows that she just don't go
She's my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
White wall slicks with racing mags
She's just for looks, man, not for drags

'Cause it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)


Well the guys all dig it they've got no complaints
About my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
And the chicks really flip for that metal flake paint
On my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
It really rates fine in the custom clan
With hand-formed panels, tuck-and-roll rear pan



Well the engine compartment's filled with all chrome goodies
In my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
Yeah but everybody takes me even old Ford woodies
In my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
When it comes to speed, man, I'm just out of luck
I'm even shut down by the ice cream truck




 Before we met there must have been some others
Like storybook and fairy tale lovers
But in my life there's never been another
So perfect lover

Oh ho darling
Now that I've found you
It's like a missing piece of puzzle has appeared
And now my darling
My love surrounds you
And since you came into my life my love
Perfection's never ever been so near

To love and to be loved is so inspiring
And that's why every lover's so desiring
Of the love they're seeking never retiring
Always aspiring
Love like just like moonlight glowing
Our love keeps growing


Lying here with you in the night
Underneath the heavenly skies
Baby what a beautiful sight
Darling now hold me, hold me tight


Darling (God only knows)
Found you (how I love you ee ooo)
Darling(God only knows)
Found you (how I love you ee ooo)




 We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
Because we like living right, and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
That's because we like holding hands and pitching woo
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids there still respect the college dean


White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA




 Old man river
Old man river
He must say something (he don't know nothing)
He don't say nothing
He just keeps rolling along
He keeps on rolling along
He don't plant taters
He don't plant cotton
And them that plants them
Are soon forgotten
That old man river
He keeps on rolling along




 Let me go away from the Mississippi
Let me go away from the white man boss
Show me that stream called the river Jordan
That's the ol' stream that I long to cross
Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
He must know somethin' but don't say nothin'
He just keeps rollin'
He keeps on rollin' along
He don't plant taters, he don't plant cotton
And then that plants them is soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River
He just keeps on rollin' along
You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all achin' and racked with pain
Tote that barge, lift that bale
You get a little drunk and you land in jail
I get weary and sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin' and scared of dyin'
But Ol' Man River
He just keeps rollin' along
You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all achin' and racked with pain
Tote that barge, lift that bale
You get a little drunk and you land in jail
I get weary and sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin' and scared of dyin'
But Ol' Man River
He just keeps rollin' along

 Love is so many things that I feel
I have only felt with you
Only With You
And then there are the things that we do
That I've only done with you
Only With You
Before love had always had its up and downs
Until the love I finally found
I know one thing for sure I want to do
I want to spend this life with you
Only With You




 I've been cruising round the town, now
With the guys for quite a while
Oh, we been thinking about starting up a club
That shows some class and style
And we'll get the finest cars
We got a Deuce Coupe
A Stingray, a rail job and an X K E
(We'll start a car club)
We'll be the fastest at the drags
Man, we'll really cut some low ETs
(We'll start a car club)
And wipe out the other clubs

Well, we'll set a meeting and get a sponsor
And collect some dues
And you can bet that we'll have
Our jackets on wherever we cruise

We'll get the roughest and the toughest
Initiation we can find
(We'll start a car club)

And if you want to try to get in
We'll really put you through the grind
(We'll start a car club)
This club's the very best




Car club, car club
(Start a car club)

 I thought about a summer day
And how the time just floats away
Pretty things like incense and flowers
I want to make them part of

Our sweet love could last forever

I thought about a winter night
And how I'd like to hold you tight
Candlelight the warmth of a fire
We could make them part of


Sweet love, sweet love
Like a child with his new toy
My heart is filled with joy for


Lord knows I love her so
I feel it down inside my soul
A precious love like this can flower
There's nothing in this world like




 We look like we know what we're doing
When they ask us to play
Only takes two or three minutes
To warm up and give it our best
And beat all the rest
The girls in the stands and all of our fans
We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one
We run out onto the court
We're playing our favorite sport
We don't care about the big guys
We're taking them down to our size
And we get a rise
From the girls in the stands and all of our fans
Yeah
We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one
Give it our best
And beat all the rest
For the girls in the stands and all of our fans
We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one




 Sometimes I realize my days are getting on
Sometimes I realize it's time to move along
And I wanna go home
Sunlight's fading and there's not much left to say
My life, I'm better off alone
My life, I'm better on my own
Driving down Pacific Coast, out on Highway One
The setting sun
Goodbye




 Last night I took a walk in the dark
To a place called Palisades Park
To have some fun, to see what I could see
That's where the girls are
I took a ride on the shoopty shoop
The girl I sat with almost, almost puked
And when it stopped
She was holding hands with me
My arms were flying up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Fast like a loopty loop
Then around like a merry-go-round

We even ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rocking band
And when she winked, I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love
You'll never know how great it just can feel
Until it stops at the top of the Ferris Wheel
I fell in love, down at Palisades Park

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Down at Palisades Park
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When at Palisades Park




 Ah, Papa-oom-muh-muh-muh-muh

 Well there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Who will die on you till the bitter end
There's nothing worse than a burning heart
Or a past that tears the world apart

I've been thinking about my situation
Nothing ventured nothing left to lose
When it's easier to just say nothing
I had thought about what I might lose

But through the child's eyes
There were feelings
Touching my violet skin
When the love games start appealing
YOu better get out and move on in

Because there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Or a pioneer of a dying trend
Nothing worse than a silent ghost
Or to lose your head at the starting post

Ain't it always just a short vacation
When it's love it always has an end
Under the sheets of life it's just frustration
While the body goes in search again



Why do you love someone
Who wants to break your heart
Why do you need someone
Who wants to tear your world apart
No no not again

I was packing up my life in cases
For a hundred years or maybe more
I've been talking to a million people
Don't you think I should have known the score




No no not again




 If you knew a-Peggy Sue
Then you'd know why I feel blue
My Peggy a-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, yes I love you, Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Oh how my heart yearns for you
Oh Peggy--my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, yes I love you, Peggy Sue

I love you, Peggy Sue
With a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy--my-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue

Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue
My Peggy a-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue
(Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue)

 It looks like rain and it's been coming on for hours
It looks like rain I hear the rumble of thunder showers
Pretty soon the rain will play its sweet refrain
While we listen from inside
And until it stops, we'll hear the drips and drops
From beside the fireside

So let it rain (pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (going drip
Drop drip drop)
Yeah and we'll be happy when it stops (pitter patter, pitter patter of
The rain) (going drip drop drip drop)
'Cause when it rains (pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (going
Drip drop drip drop)
The ways of love rise in my heart (pitter patter, pitter patter of the
Rain) (going drip drop drip drop)
We won't be sad when there is a storm (ooooo)
And we can be glad (ooooo)
'Cause we can keep warm, yeah, yeah

Listen to the rain
Pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain (going drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter (going drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter oooo

A rain swept plain
Soon after springtime rains blow over
Will sprout new grain
And miles of fresh green fields of clover
Winter and its cold soon will lose its hold
With the changes spring will bring
Sun comes pouring down warming up the ground
Bringing new life with the spring

So let it rain (pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (going drip
Drop drip drop)
Yeah and we'll be happy when it stops (pitter patter, pitter patter of
The rain) (going drip drop drip drop)
'Cause when it rains (pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (going
Drip drop drip drop)
The ways of love rise in my heart (pitter patter, pitter patter of the
Rain) (going drip drop drip drop)
And like the rising tides love is growing stronger (ooooo)
Let's ride out the storm just a little bit longer yeah (ooooo)




 Now here we are together
This would've been worth waiting forever
I always knew it'd feel this way
And please forgive my shaking
Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
Can't make myself say what I planned to say

Baby
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love

I built all my goals around you
That some day my love would surround you
You'll never know what we've been through
For so long I thought about it
And now I just can't live without it
This beautiful image I have of you


I love you




 Now here we are together
This would've been worth waiting forever
I always it'd feel this way
And please forgive my shaking
Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
Can't make myself say what I planned to say
Baby
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love
I built all my goals around you
That some day my love would surround you
You'll never know what we've been through
For so long I thought about it
And now I just can't live without it
This beautiful image I have of you
Baby
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love
I love you




 Rah rah pom pom play girl
Pom pom play girl

(Oooooo)
You see her in a short skirt down on the grass
She's wondering if the team's going to run kick or pass
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
Since she doesn't really know why she's waving her hands
She's a-thinking 'bout the boy sitting up in the stands


(Chi chi bah)
Just a little social clique with the other song queens
With a freshman or a sophomore she wouldn't be seen
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She's a doll and she knows it and she thinks that her face
Will get her any body any thing and any place


Chi chi bah (Oooooo)
Since she's the head cheerleader she dates the quarterback
And her best friend's going out with the full back
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She might even run for an office this Spring
And that ought to really make her telephone ring


(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wooooo
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wooo
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Shake it
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wave those pom poms all around
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wow
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wow
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)




 A few days later the king and queen of the castle were invited to a ball
As they were leaving that evening the queen said to the young prince
Who was the eldest of the children
"Take care of the other ones tonight
And don't try to find that radio
We have it hidden away
We'll be home by midnight"
And then she said "goodbye"
The children's mother left
And the party had begun
And the children looked everywhere
High and low
Checking to see if they could find that transistor radio
They couldn't find it they couldn't find it
They looked upstairs and downstairs
All through the castle and finally
All of a sudden they heard a sound
What is that sound is it possible
Could it be the Pied Piper himself
Coming out of the magic transistor radio
Or was it just the wind whistling by the castle window
No one knows if the mysterious Pied Piper of Night
Was the one who came back to visit the princes and princesses again
But if you have a transistor radio and the lights are all out some night
Don't be very surprised if it turns to light green
And the whirling magic sound of the Pied Piper comes to visit you

(Bow bow)
(I'm the Pied Piper)
(Bow bow bow bow bow)
(In the radio)

 Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away across the sea
It's been two years or so
Since i saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
Oh it said that we were through
She's found somebody new
Oh baby's gone what can i do

(Remember)
Hey i remember
("Walking in the sand")
"Walking in the sand"
(Remember remember)
("Walking in the sand")
Walking hand in hand
("Walking in the sand")
"Walking in the sand"
(Remember remember)
("Walking in the sand")
Walking hand in hand
("Walking in the sand")

I want to know
What ever happened to
The little girl i once knew
She said that she'd be true


Remember
Remember
"Walking in the sand" 




 Walkin' down by the river
Water running through my knees (ooh)
River, oh river moves so free (ooh)
Oh mighty river endlessly
Ooh, mighty river
I would love to be like you
Ooh, lonely river
Has not got the time to say
I was born into the city life
It's all that I've ever known
You know it's rough gettin' round this place
So crowded I can hardly breathe
You can only see about a block or two
In L. A. that's the truth
I'm lookin' for some country life
Some kickin' room no more city life
I want the river
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)

Rollin' rollin' rollin' on river
(I got to get away, I got to get away, I got to get away)
Rollin' rollin' rollin' on
It breaks my heart to see the city
I wonder why it ain't pretty
Oh I want to cry, want to cry
Come on you've got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away
You got to do it, do it, do it
You got to run away, you got to run away

 Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony


I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she could hear my man wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane


Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

[Outro
Say, if you want to dance with me
It's got to be some of that
If you wanna dance with me




 I saw some surfer girls in west L.A
And right away it got me thinking about my high school days
Well I was always kind of shy you know I never learned to dance
And I remember being nervous I was scared to take a chance
And it happened it was looking through my mamma's things
I found some rock and roll records and I learned to sing!

Rock and roll to the rescue
Rock and roll to the rescue
Rock to the rescue
I said it rescued me
And it'll rescue you

Now believe it when I tell you that I never felt alive
Not till the night I started rocking to my mamma's 45
Well it was one for the money now and two for the show
Baby you better get already now and go cat go!
Yeah the long tall Sally got me bopping around the room
She sing be bop wadda loo bop a-whop bam boom


So we got a band together now we're really quite the rage
Oh how I lose my inhibitions when I move across the stage
We're the hottest ticket going what a fantasy flight
They tell me fifty thousand people come to see us every night




 Instrumental

 Well she's a roller skating child
With a ribbon in her hair
She gets my heart to beating
When I see her there
You know my heart starts smiling when she sings
She's such an angel I bet she's got wings

And we'll make sweet loving when the sun goes down
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Well oh my oh gosh oh gee
She really send chills inside of me

They've got a record playing in the skating rink
She comes skating past me and she gives me a wink
I go and get my skates on and I catch up with her
We do it holding hands it's so cold I go "brrr"


Round and around and around we go
The music keeps me on my feet
It's sweet it's sweet it's sweeter than honey
When we're walking down the street
(That's right)
We run in to the kitchen and we grab a bite
Her folks let me stay with her until late at night
So many guys want a girl like mine
A love like this happens only one time


Roller skating child

 I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened
Sail on, sail on sailor
I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor
Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail
Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor
I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor
Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor

 Started off the day with a thought
That took me far away
I think I found a place
Where I know I can be forever
It's down in San Miguel
(Lookin' for lookin' for lookin' for a lady)
Could be in Mexico
Where you don't need no dough
I know I'm gonna go
Lookin' for the ladies of love
I go where I'm going
Goin' straight ahead
Down in to San Miguel
Over the top
We cross the border now
Headin' in to San Miguel
That's where I'm gonna go
(lookin for lookin for lookin' for a lady)
Hope you will be comin' too
You can kick off your shoes
Come on it's time to go
Lookin' for the ladies of love
Ow ow
Yiyiyiyiyiyi
It's down in San Miguel
(Lookin for lookin for lookin for a lady)
Could be in Mexico
Where you don't need no dough
I know I'm gonna go
Lookin' for the ladies of love
La la la la

 Here in Southern California there is a weather condition known as the Santa Ana Winds

Fire wind
Oh desert wind
She was born in a desert breeze
And wind her way
Through Canyon Way
From the desert to the silvery sea
In every direction
See the perfection
And see the San Gabriel Mountain scene

Santa Ana winds keep blowing across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowing across my eyes

Fill my sails
Oh desert wind
And hold the waves high for me
Then I will come
And test my skill
Where the Santa Ana winds blow free
In waves of elation
My part of creation
Becoming one with the boundless sea


I am the wind
Oh desert wind
On my pilgrimage to the sea
I will prevail
I will not fail
To bring life into humanity
My song is creation
I've been through the nation
Whispering the wisdom and its purity

 I want to meet Santa Claus, the real real Santa
He wants to meet old Santa Claus

I took my brother to the department store
He wanted to show Santa his Christmas list
He stood in line and he shook like a leaf
He's only five and a half going on six
He said, "Is that (that Santa) really Santa Claus, really really (the real Santa) Santa Claus?
Is that (that Santa) really Santa Claus, really really Santa? (I hope he doesn't pull Santa's beard)
Is that (that Santa) really Santa Claus, really really (the real Santa) Santa?"
Hope he thinks that's Santa Claus
I picked him up and put him on Santa's lap
And then he pulled the pillow out of his shirt
He yanked the beard right on off of his chin
And in his eyes I could see he was hurt
He said, "You're not (not Santa) really Santa Claus, you're really not (the real Santa) Santa Claus
You're not (not Santa) really Santa Claus, you're really not Santa (he shouldn't have pulled Santa's beard)

 School days
School days
Dear old Golden Rule days

Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the Golden Rule
American History and Practical Math
Studying hard and hoping to pass
And working your fingers right down the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
The teacher don't know how mean she looks
Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books get out of your seat
And down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and around the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're making romance
And all day long you've been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
And round and round and round you go

Hail hail rock and roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock and roll
The beat of the drums loud and bold
Rock rock rock and roll
The feeling is there, body and soul




 The old man rhythm's gotten in my shoes
Know you're sittin' here and singing the blues
So be my guest you got nothing to loose

 Adieu Emile, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were 9 or 10
Together we climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABCs
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Adieu Emile, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time

Adieu Papa please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wondered how I got along
Adieu Papa it's hard to die (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
When all the birds are singing in the sky (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
Now that the spring is in the air (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
Little children everywhere (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
When you see them I'll be there (ba ba)


Adieu Francoise, my trusted wife
Without you I'd have had a lonely life
You cheated lots of times but then
I forgave you in the end
Though your lover was my friend
Adieu Francoise it's hard to die (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
When all the birds are singing in the sky (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
Now that the spring is in the air (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
With your lovers everywhere (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
Just be careful I'll be there (ba, ba)

All our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun (ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
But the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach (ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
All our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun (ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
But the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

 I want her I need her
But I never let her know before
Kept her in the dark
Thought I lost her heart forever
She told me "just show me
The feelings that you keep inside
And I promise that
We can put it back together"

She believes in love again
She belives in me
Now we've gone far beyond
The way we used to be
And in her eyes from deep inside
She finally let me see
She believes in love again
She belives in me

I woke up I spoke up
And let her know the way I feel
Changes I could make
Wouldn't have to take a lifetime
She wants me she needs me
She always let me know before
And now it's up to me
To give her all the things she needs the right way


I just nearly blew it
How could I do it
I think about the pain I had put her through
God I'm sorry
She said she'd recover
If only I'd love her
She'd open up her soul
And share her life with me


In her eyes from deep inside
She finally let me see that
She believes in love again
She believes in me




 She knows me
She knows me

Sometimes I have a weird way of showing my love
And I always expect her to know what I'm thinking of


I treat her so mean I don't deserve what I have
And I think that she'll forgive just by making her laugh
But she knows me

She knows me too well
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
She knows me too well

I get so jealous of the other guy
And then I'm not happy til I make her break down and cry
When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
But she knows me



When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
Cause she knows me




 Did you ever listen with the music missing
Turn your radio on
When the trees are swaying and the band is playing
Our favorite song
Shelter from the sunlight
Shelter from the cold night

Just where I wanna be
Baby just you and me
Staying at home

Summertime, take a few calls, make a little love
Thank God for shelter

I'll give you shelter from the storm
And a house to keep you warm
I'll give you shelter through the night
And a chance to make this right

Do you ever still think of me
And the way that we used to be
When the world was just you and me
Hanging out in our shelter

Now it's two o'clock
Lines around the block
Waiting for the parade
When the dark of night
Or the bright sunlight
Has you runnin' for shade
Together we can run and hide
Maybe we can stay inside





Do you think that you'd ever stay
Take a page out of yesterday
If we could only find a way
Hanging out in our shelter




 Silken hair, more silken hair fell on her face and no wind was blowing
(She was goin' bald)
Silken hair, more silken hair lay near her pillbox down at her feet
(She'd been on a trip)
I peeked in and when I saw she'd lost her hair I thought I would keel over
(She was goin' bald)
When she saw her shining forehead didn't stop she swooned to the ground
(Really flipped her wig)
Laughed so hard I blew my mind I blew my cool I blew myself over
Oh oh oh oh what a blow
Sha na na, sha na na na na na na na na
(What a blow)
She drew a comb across her scalp and brushed what she had left!
I tried to salvage what I could and threw it in a sack!
She made a b-line to her room and grabbed all kind o' juice!
She started pouring it on her head and thought it'd grow it back!
You're too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
(No more, no more, no more, no more)
(Upside your head)




 Last night I went out disco dancing
Saw a foxy girl out on the floor
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
She came to my table
We both ordered something to drink (something to drink)
Before you know it, what do you think
The music started playing
Oo the music got us so excited
And we had to get up on our feet
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
The place was near closing
I offered to take her home (take her home)
But she was with someone and left me alone
But I still remember

Oo I know I never will forget her
And I hope I get to see her again
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Never will forget her




 Mama's little baby loves shortening shortening
Mama's little baby loves shortening bread

Put on the skillet
Slip on the lid
Mammy's going to make us some shortening bread
And that ain't all
Our mammy's going to do
She's going to cook us some coffee, too


I slipped in the kitchen
Raised up the lid
I stole me a mess of that shortening bread
I walked up to a pretty girl and I said
Baby how'd you like some shortening bread


They caught me with the skillet
They caught me with the lid
They caught me with the girl eating shortening bread
Six months for the skillet
Six months for the lid
Now I'm doing time for eating shortening bread

Shortening
Shortening bread
Shortening
Shortening bread

 Lots of people with no place to go
I know a place where you can go
You've got the ticket, come on slip inside
And let my song take you for a ride

Come on won't you let me be
By your side from now and eternity
Because I love you, baby I do

And now can't you see what has come over me
Oh, my life is growing like a big oak tree
Because I love you, baby I do
And now can't you see

Why don't you come and let me kiss and make it better
I'm not the one who come and left it later
Now you relax and let your mind go free
You won't regret the feeling you receive



My love is growing
Your heart is knowing
Our love is growing

Mama, oh can't you see
What has come over me
For my life
Oh, baby

 I'll set the stage while she's still dancing
I'll make the music soft and slow
Then i'll turn down the lights
Make things just right
For every slow song that we know

Over and over again
One summer night
(Do do do)
We fell in love
One summer night
I held you tight
(one summer, one summer)
You and i
(One summer, one summer)
Under the moon for love
(Ooo one summer, one summer)

We'll spin around this room together
I'll treat my angel really nice
We'll fall in love, we'll fall forever
Thank god for lazy summer nights

Over and over again
One summer night
(Do do do)
(One summer, one summer)
I kissed your lips
(One summer, one summer)
One summer night
(One summer, one summer)
I held you close
(One summer, one summer)
You and i
(One summer, one summer)
Under the moon of love
(Ooo one summer, one summer)
(One summer, one summer)
One summer night

(one summer, one summer) 
One summer night
(one summer, one summer)
Under the moon of love
(Ooo one summer, one summer)
Under the moon of love
(Ooo one summer, one summer)
Under the moon of
Love




 What do the planets mean? And have you ever seen
Sunrise in the morn? It shined when you were born
Saturn has rings all around it
I searched the sky and I found it

Solar system
Brings us wisdom

Then there's the Milky Way, that's where the angels play
You've seen the lover's moon, looks good in the month of June
Neptune is god of the sea-ea-ea
Pluto is too far to see-ee-ee


The constellations are stars that form animals
Leo and Capricorn, too
Star bright, star light
Make this wish come true tonight
If Mars had life on it I might find my wife on it
Venus the goddess of love can thank all the stars above
Mercury's close to the sun
You'll see it when day is done




 Some some some of your love (won't you give me some)
Some of your love
Some some some of your love (dip de doody doo ah ah)

You gotta see my favorite little acrobat
She really got her every little move down pat
She's got my vote for number one in the class
I couldn't help but try to make a forward pass


There's nothing like a-romancing in the stands
Walking down the hallways a-holding hands
Punching up our jukebox favorite band
Cuddling up in summer moonlight in the sand

Kiss me, baby
Hold me tight tonight




 Late last night I got an S. O. S
The fairy tale girl's in deep in distress
She says I don't know where I am
But it's near Japan

My engine's all burned out
My crew has all bailed out
I don't know where I am
But it's somewhere near Japan

And she said
"Rescue me
I'm somewhere in the
China Sea
I think I'm sinking fast
This call is probably my last
I'm throwing out a life line
And I'm doing it for old time's sake
Though I know you're gonna break my heart
One more time



And she said "thank you dear
I think she sounded quite sincere
And when she turned to go
She said "I crave adventure don't you know

And now she's drifting on some Chinese junk
Her world is spinning and her hope has sunk
So I close my eyes
And somewhere near Japan
The spinning stopped and the world stood still
I broke her fall and I always will
Strung out in no man's land
Somewhere near Japan
Rescue me




 In that soulful ol' man sunshine
She looks so fresh and sweet, keeps herself soft and tender
No wonder that I can sing a song about my baby
She looks so healthy, I feel so doggone wealthy
No wonder that I can sing a song about my baby
So happy, together love is better in that soulful ol' man sunshine
Do-do-do
She wakes up singing songs, of happy everafters
Well let me just tell you 'bout my ever-lovin' lady

The morning we walked together laughin' in the sunshine
Hey old man shine your love on me
Hey old man shine your love on me
Soulful old man sunshine shine your light divine on me

 Look out here come those South Bay surfers
California's getting hot
There they go cruising down that coastline
Looking for their favorite spot
We'll find the big one
Oh, the boys are rough
And ready to handle anything
They take the big one
They've got to be the best thing going
South Bay surfers really swing
Okay, rock out
Oh, Chicago can't you hear them
Hear that shore pound slam
You're going to eat it
Smash
It rumbles clear to New York City
Detroit back to old Miami
Philly back to Alabama

You'll catch them surfing




 Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America

The Bonneville salt flats had seen some strange things
But the strangest thing yet was a jet without wings
Once as a jet it played in the stars
But now on the ground it's the king of our cars


An airplane an auto now famous worldwide
The Spirit of America, the name on the side
The man who would drive her Craig Breed love by name
A daring young man played a dangerous game


With a J-47, a jet for his power
Craig Breed love had averaged four-o-seven per hour
Both man and machine had given fair warn
They'd set a new record on that warm August morn




 Driving around, living the dream
I'm cruising the town, I'm digging the scene
I'm not gonna stress, not going to worry
Doing our best, no need to hurry
Looking ahead with anticipation
Making each day a new celebration
Seems like it could go on forever
As long as we can all stay together
We used to get around
Get up and hit up all the hot spots in town

Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah

As for the past, that's all behind us
Happier now, look what life finds us
Singing our songs is enough reason
Harmony boys is what we believe in
Some said it wouldn't last
All we can say is we're still having a blast


Every night's special occasion




 The river's a bed of sweet berries and flowers
Banks of thirsty lies
(Please be careful)
The stream is an eyeglass of heroes
Bridged with bright replies
The creek is a funnel of forgiveness
Winning every prize
Steamboat of living ever faithfully ride
The river's a dream in a waltz time
Banks of jasper glaze
(Have a ball and sing)
The stream is a timepiece of children
Bridged with crystal haze
The creek is a trumpet of hard times
Blowing tasty days
Steamboat of living ever faithfully glide
Don't worry mister Fulton
We'll get your steamboat rolling

 Time for supper now
Day's been hard and I'm so tired
I feel like eating now
Smell the kitchen now
Hear the maid whistle a tune
My thoughts are fleeting now
Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above
Young and beautiful
Like a tree that's just been planted
I found life today
I made mistakes today
Will I ever learn the lessons
That all come my way
Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above
When I was younger
My mother told me
Jesus loved the world
And if that's true then
Why hasn't he helped me to find a girl
And find my world
'Til then I'm just a dreamer
I'm convinced of it
The hypnosis of our minds can take us far away
It's so easy now
You see someone up there high
And heaven's here to stay
Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above
I'll find my world
I'll find my world
Someday I'll find my world
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah




 He used to ride the sidewalks in a landlocked town
A solitary surfer still he got around
He had his favorite spots now
Where the best rides could be found
With posters on his wall from "surfer" magazine
His room looked like a shrine to the surfing scene
Go to hawaii out of high school was his big time college dream
(That's where the girls are)
Did you ever wonder what happened to surfer joe
He up and took a trawler down to mexico
With a pretty senorita we both used to know
You can see him catch a wave in the morning light
And sometimes you can find him on his board at night
A silouette on water as the sun dips outta sight

He's still surfing
(Still surfing)
He's still surfing
(Still surfing)
You'll catch him on a wave on his way to class
Then be back there after school on his daylight glass
He's still surfing
(Still surfing)
He's still surfing
(Still surfing)
Surfers always love them summer days
With a board in the water rolling with the waves
He's still surfing

He's always been a surfer since the early days
Spending the summer searching for that perfect wave
He and his surfing senorita never seem to age
He doesn't do a whole lot with his law degree
They thought about a major oceanography
But he does a lot of thinking about how to save the sea
(That's where the waves are)
Things up north were getting kinda out of hand
So he got a break to see the ride on the sand
With his little mama seated in a surfer's never never land
You can see him catch a wave in the morning light
And sometimes you can find him on his board at night
A silhouette on water as the sun dips outta sight


In the morning light he still surfing
On his board at night he's still surfing
In the summer days he's still surfing
Rolling with the waves he's still surfing

 On Santa Monica city pier
We watch the people who gather here
The uninvited who've lost their way
And now we're all here to stay

And it's a strange world
There's nothing to it
Strange world
I'm getting through it
Strange world
Thinking it over
It's a strange world after all

Multi-colourful lives we run
To catch a glimpse of the setting sun
I can't imagine how life would be
If you were not here with me


Sunday morning
Skies so blue
Yo te amo
Means I love you
You can drive your car
To the county fair
Or ride your bicycle anywhere
It doesn't matter that much to me
Cause we're pretty good company




 Starting out with Berkeley Free Speech
And later on at People's Park
The winds of change fanned into flames
Student demonstrations spark
Down to Isla Vista where police felt so harassed
They called the special riot squad of the L. A. County Sheriff
Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Student demonstration time
The violence spread down South to where Jackson State brothers
Learned not to say nasty things about Southern policemen's mothers
Nothing much was said about it and really next to nothing done
The pen is mightier than the sword, but no match for a gun
Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Well there's a riot going on
Cause it's student demonstration time
America was stunned on May 4, 1970
When rally turned to riot up at Kent State University
They said the students scared the Guard
Though the troops were battle dressed
Four martyrs earned a new degree
The Bachelor of Bullets
I know we're all fed up with useless wars and racial strife
But next time there's a riot, well, you best stay out of sight
Well there's a riot going on
There's a riot going on
Well there's a riot going on
Student demonstration time
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
It's student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
It's student demonstration
Stay away when there's a riot going on
Student demonstration




 Sumahama
There's a lover's leap in old Japan
Where the lovers walk along the sand
Hand in hand at Sumahama
Sumahama
Born a lovely oriental daughter
Never ever having met her father
Asks some questions of her mother

Tell me tell me mama
Will you ever go again to Sumahama
Perhaps you'll find love there
Somewhere between the Earth the sky and water
There at Sumahama

Sumahama
In the autumn as the leaves are falling
One can almost hear the lovers calling
From the sea at Sumahama
Sumahama
Years have past and tears have long since dried
But no amount of time could hope to hide
A love so strong from Sumahama


Sumahama
Soko wa koi suru hitotachi ga 
Te ni te o totte aruita 
Kireino shiroi hama 

Itsu itsu, mama, Sumahama ni 
Itsu mata iku no 
Sugita ai o sagashi ni iku 
Umi no kanata, Sumahama 

Sumahama
There's a lover's leap in old Japan
Where the lovers walk along the sand
Hand and hand at Sumahama
Sumahama
Sumahama, aki ni ki no haga chiru yo ni 
Sabishiku kanashii koi no uta 
Sumahama no umi kara 




 Way back when well our master plan
Was havin' fun fun fun as america's band
Well we came out rockin' with rhonda and barbara ann
Singin' of surf and sand
Now when we look back over all the fun we had
If our lifestyle's over now it sure is sad
We gotta get back to livin' without a care
Give me sunshine water and an ozone layer
Paradise is a state of mind
Where mother nature nurtures and man is kind
We need a change now wouldn't it be nice
If we could bring back summer
Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise

(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise
They chop down the forests
And in their haste leave a trail of destruction
And toxic waste is leaving no one safe
In their home or their habitat
Can't let it go like that
Too much consumption and too much greed
When you consider all the people
That are living in need
Interdependence in this world is a natural fact
And we're all under attack
It's the eve of destruction or so they say
But mankind doesn't have to go that way
If we all get together we can make things right
And we can bring back summer
Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise

(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise

Surfers recycle now don't you know
Like everyone from california to kokomo
We're gonna keep on rocking
And raising world consciousness
We gotta fix this mess
Looked in the future and what i saw
Was a world in harmony with natural law
There's trouble now but it will be alright if we can
Bring back summer
Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise

(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise

(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise 




 In the still of the night
I held you, held you tight
Cause I really love you
Promise I'll never let you go
In the still of the night (in the still of the night)
I remember (I remember) that night in May (I remember)
The stars were bright (I remember) above (I remember)
I'll hope (I remember) and I'll pray (I remember)
To keep your precious love
Well before the dawn's light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night (in the still of the night)
I remember (I remember) that night in May (I remember)
The stars were bright (I remember) above (I remember)
I'll hope (I remember) and I'll pray (I remember)
To keep your precious love
Well before the dawn's light
Hold me again with all of your might
In the still of the night (in the still of the night)
In the still of the night

Cause it's gonna be a summer of love

Or in a swimming pool
Doing unto others is the golden rule
But doing it with you would be so
Very cool

Girls are always ready for a summer of love
Going out and looking for love (girls are always ready)
Girls are always ready for a summer of love (sum sum summer summer of love)
Going out and looking for love (sum sum summer summer of love)
I can't wait til summer (yeah)
Cause it's gonna be a summer of love
Hey now (well it's a love thing)

Every-time the weather starts to getting hotter
Don't worry about it toos your clothes and hit the water
We'll be california dreaming bay watching everyday
Just off the malibu surfing u.s.a
Now no girl ever wants to leave their
Love back home (wah wah oooo)
So if you miss him baby
Call him on the phone
But make it quick
We're almost in a party zone
Cause summer days and nights
Aren't meant to spend alone


Now summer is a time when there're no strings attached
But we could get together if you com on back
I'd like to tell you if it's any satisfaction
You'll always be my summer seasons main attraction




 Summer’s gone
Summer’s gone away
Gone away
With yesterday

Old friends have gone
They’ve gone their separate ways
Our dreams hold on
For those who still have more to say


The nights grow cold
It’s time to go
I’m thinking maybe I’ll just stay


It’s finally sinking in
One day begins
Another ends
I live them all and back again


I’m gonna sit and watch the waves
We laugh, we cry
We live then die
And dream about our yesterday




 I'm gonna raise a fuss, I'm gonna raise a holler
About a workin' all summer just to try to earn a dollar
Every time I call my baby, and ask to get a date
My boss says, "No dice son, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well my mom and pop told me, "Son you gotta make some money"
If you want to use the car to go ridin' next Sunday
Well I didn't go to work, told the boss I was sick
"Well you can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues

I'm gonna take the weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
I'm gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well I called my congressman and he said "Whoa!"
"I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a gonna do
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues




 Dum dum dum be dum be doo
Dum dum dum be dum be doo
Dum dum dum be dum be doo
Dum dum dum be dum be doo

With a smile she brings me light
She can make my whole world bright
She brings out the sun at night
She's my sunshine

Life would be full
Sailing on the sea
In a boat
Just a  knee
And propose
That she'll be my only one

She can make you feel so fine
Like to love her all the time
It's the reason I'm a-pleasing my sunshine

Some-a-day I'm
Going to marry her
Some-a-way I'm
Going to carry her
To a place where we can play in the sun

Like a full moon shining bright
She'll light up the darkest night
Will she squeeze me
How she'll please me
Sunshine


Never felt a kiss so sweet
Never could I ever meet
Someone even half as sweet as my
Sunshine


Dum dum dum be dum be do
Dum dum dum be dum be do

 It's a genuine fact that the surfers rule

It's plastered on the walls all around the school, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Becoming just as common as a golden rule, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Take it or leave it but you better believe it, surfers rule
They burnt it in the grass on the football field, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Just try to make them cool it and they'll never yield, now
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
Take what you've heard, now and go pass the word now
Surfers rule


A woody full of surfers pulling long side a wagon
(Surfers rule, surfers rule)
The hodaddies sitting while the surfers are dragging
The surfers are winning and they say as they're grinning
Surfers rule

Surfers rule
(Four seasons, you better believe it)

Everybody's learning how
Come on on safari with me
(Come on on safari with me)

Early in the morning we'll be starting out
Some honeys will be coming along
We're loading up our Woody
With our boards inside
And heading out singing our song

Come on (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)
Yes I'm going to (surfing) take you surfing (surfing safari) with me
Come along (surfing) baby wait and see (surfing safari)

At Huntington and Malibu
They're shooting the pier
At Rincon they're walking the nose
We're going on safari to the islands this year
So if you're coming get ready to go



They're angling in Laguna in Cerro Azul
They're kicking out in Dohini too
I tell you surfing's mighty wild
It's getting bigger every day
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru

 A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome man and baton
(Bygone, bygone)
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
(Bygone, bygone)
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?
Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?
Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die
A choke of grief heart hardened, I
Beyond belief, a broken man too tough to cry
Surf's Up, mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
A children's song
Have you listened as they played
Their song is love
And the children know the way
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Child, child, child, child, child
Na na na na na na na na
Child, child, child, child, child
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child

 Susie Cincinnati
Got a groovy little motor car
She lives for the night
And her husband's a security guard
Her looks aren't exactly a plus
But it doesn't matter to us
Because she knows where it's at
And she gets you there in seconds flat
She knows all the honkies
And the kids are all home in bed
(Ooh ride Susie Cincinnati)
She'd rather do this
Than anything else instead
(Ooh ride Susie Cincinnati)
She got the nicotine fit
And before she discovered it
(Ooh ride Susie Cincinnati)
Everybody in the back seat suffocated

Susie Cincinnati we thought you were a winner
Susie Cincinnati city's number one sinner
Yeah

She'll always pick you up
When the others go and let you down
(Ooh ride, ooh ride Susie Cincinnati)
In her little red cab she's scooting all over town
(Ooh ride, ooh ride Susie Cincinnati)
She's got a money meter too
All polished up, it shines for you
But it's just for looks
Because she'll give the ride free to you

Susie Cincinnati




 There's something special about it
Just what, I can't quite say
But there's no doubt that it's different
From any other day
There are no words to exactly describe
What I'm speakin' of
It's just a sweet Sunday kinda love
We'll read the funnies together
And watch some T.V. too
You can do something for me
And I'll do the same for you
We'll fill the hours with things
That we both most like to do
Spending a sweet Sunday lovin' you
Why don't we unplug the phone?
Let's pretend nobody's home, quietly
Just you and me, oh how nice that will be
All through the week I'll look back upon that
Sweet Sunday time
While looking forward to that special happiness
We'll find
When we awaken to hear from a songbird up above
Sounds of a sweet Sunday kinda love

 I do them when I'm down in the tub
With avocado cream they'll take a rub
They wrinkle like a-raisins if I stay too long
I wouldn't want to do it wrong
They'll put you in the driver's seat
And to the table when you want to eat
But when you go to sit down in your chair
Something else has got to put you there

Take good care of your feet, Pete
You better watch out what you eat, Pete
Better take care of your life
Because nobody else will

They'll twinkle when you fall in love
And put you there when you jump up above
When you're on the spot, get them right under you
One, then the other too
If you want to do the right thing for them
Just take a walk in the grass
But don't you catch yourself falling
Or stepping on a piece of glass
(Ouch glass)
Pete knows all the treacherous blows
The fallen arches and the cramp in the toes
He went to H. E. L. P. and got some sandals new
And dusty old saunas too


Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do




 Talk to me
I love the things you say
Talk to me
In your own
Sweet gentle way

Let me hear
Tell me dear
Tell me, ooh
You love me so

Talk to me
Tell me what
I want to know

The many ways you speak of love
I've heard before
But it sounds so good
Every time
Please say the one part
I love once more
Comes from Tallahassee
She's got a high flying chassis
Maybe looks a little sassy
But to me she's real classy
Yeah, my Tallahassee lassie
Down in FLA

Talk to me
Hold me close
Whisper low

Talk to me
Baby, can't you see?
Darling, I




 Tears in the morning
(I've got tears, I've got tears in the morning)
They ain't going to tell me what to do
No, no, those tears, I know they're just a warning
(Tears, I've got tears, I've got tears, are a warning)
Reminding me I'm missing you

So you moved out up to Europe
You packed your warmth and you took your soul
Well, I hope you do what you're damn sure of
A lonely bed here takes on the cold
Lose a wife, change my life, we're not together
A cancelled future, well, it's hard on me
Gone, you're gone, are you gone forever?
Hope you love the baby I'm never going to see


Well, you know I lit a candle
It's in my heart now where it glows
Day and night, feel my light, it's going to stand until
My heart believes in what you chose
I won't let nobody carry this load for me
Guess, I keep a hold on my sorrow
I've got to feel, now all that you see




 Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan


If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

(Hey!)

Well I'm begging on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
If there's anything I can do
Because I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you
Ohh!

(Is that all? I thought there...)
(There was.)
(You did very well.)
(Brian)
("Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow?")
(Right.)
(Papa papa papa.)
(Where's an E?)
(I forget...Brian, you...before?)
(Ah, Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow.)
(Is there an E there?)
(Ah, Papa...)
(Ten more minutes, Brian.)
(Papa. Mama. Ah, ah. Is that it?)




 Ten little Indian boys

The first little Indian gave squaw pretty feather
(Little Indian boy)
The second little Indian made her an Indian dollar
(Fighting over a squaw)
Well the third little Indian gave her moccasin leather
(Little Indian boy)
The squaw didn't like 'em at all
The fourth little Indian took her riding in his big canoe
(Little Indian boy)
The fifth little Indian took her down the waterfall
(Fighting over a squaw)
The sixth little Indian taught the squaw how to woo-woo
(Little Indian boy)
But the squaw didn't like them at all

One little, two little, three little Indians
(Keep us humming we're the ten little Indians)
Four little, five little, six little Indians
(Keep us humming we're the ten little Indians)
Seven little, eight little, nine little Indians
(Keep us humming we're the ten little Indians)
Ten little Indian boys

The seventh little Indian took her over to his teepee
(Little Indian boy)
The eighth little Indian tried to give her a love poem
(Fighting over a squaw)
The ninth little Indian said "You're my Kemosabe"
(Little Indian boy)
The squaw didn't like them at all
The tenth little Indian said it really didn't matter
(Little Indian boy)
He acted like himself and he didn't look at her
(Fighting over a squaw)
The squaw didn't care if he never did a thing
(Little Indian boy)
Because she loved the tenth Indian boy

Loved the tenth Indian boy




 Well, back in time with just a rhythm and rhyme
Gregorian chants were a real big thing
They took that chant and added harmony
It was a different sound
But had the same meaning

I know (I know) I know (I know)
It took us a long while
To go (to go) to go (to go)
And find us a rock style
I know (I know) I know (I know)
That we can take it one more mile

Because
We're singing that same song
We're still singing that same song
We're singing that same song
That same song

The rock of ages
Built that rocking sound
Until more and more people start to come around
They worshiped in church
And built that great big choir
It grew and it grew
Until it spread like fire



Same song, oh yeah




 I had to prove that I could make it alone now
But that's not me
I wanted to show how independent I'd grown now
But that's not me

I could try to be big in the eyes of the world
What matters to me is what I could be to just one girl

I'm a little bit scared cause I haven't been home in a long time
You needed my love and I know that I left at the wrong time

My folks when I wrote them
Told 'em what I was up to said that's not me
I went through all kinds of changes
Took a look at myself and said that's not me

I miss my pad and the places I've known
And every night as I lay there alone I would dream

I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I'm glad I went now I'm that much more sure that we're ready
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty
I once had a dream so I packed up and split for the city
I soon found out that my lonely life wasn't so pretty

Capturing memories from afar
In my car
That's why god made the radio
So tune right in everywhere you go

The soundtrack of falling in love

 She came out with her best friend for the summer in L. A
They took a small apartment down on the beach
And you'll find them there every day

And I said
California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L. A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

We'll turn them on with all the things that will be happening night and day
We'll show them such a groovy time that they'll both be deciding to stay

And let me say
California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L. A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L. A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City




 There's a story told of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
The world they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring
As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wind
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring
Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round
For their hearts were full of spring

 We met when she was younger

How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day
Split man

 It's the little old lady from Pasadena

It's the little old lady from Pasadena
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
Has a pretty little flower bed of white gardenias
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
But parked in a rickety old garage
Is a brand new shiny red super stocked Dodge

And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

If you see her on the street just getting her kicks now
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
With her four speed stick and a four-two-six now
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
She's going to get a ticket now sooner or later
Because she can't keep her foot off the accelerator


You'll see her all the time don't try to choose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
You might drive a go-er but you'll never lose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
The guys come to race her from all around
But she'll give them a length then she'll shut them down


(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)

 He's the man with all the toys

Someone found a lighted house late one night
And he saw through the window a sight
A big man in a chair
And little tiny men everywhere
He's the man with all the toys
Well how thrilled that someone must have been
And he must have been tempted to go in
He stayed out in the cold
And when he left them he told
About the man with all the toys

He's the man with all the toys
The man with all the toys
He's the man with all the toys
The man with all the toys

 The night was so young and everything still
The moon shining bright on my window sill
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
And then I think why does she have to hide

Is somebody going to tell me why she has to hi-i-ide
She's passing it by, she won't even try
To make this love go where it should

The sky's turning gray, there's clouds overhead
I'm still not asleep, I'm in my bed
I think of her eyes and it makes me sigh
I think of her voice and it makes me cry

Is somebody going to tell me why she has to lie-i-ie
She'd be so right to hold me tonight
Love was made for her and I

It's three o'clock I go to my sink
I pour some milk and I start to think
Is she asleep or is she awake
And does she think of the love we could make
Wake up, call me baby call me tell me what's on your mi-i-ind
I've got a car and you're not too far
Please let me come over to you
The night was so young and everything still
The moon shining bright on my window sill
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
And then I think why should she hide




 Well I walked up to her and I asked her if she wanted to dance
She looked awful nice and so I hoped she might take a chance
When we danced I held her tight
Then I walked her home that night
And all the stars were shining bright

And then I kissed her

Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
And so I whispered I love you
And she said that she loved me too

And then I kissed her

I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
I kissed her in a way that I hope she liked for evermore

I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had
Then one day she'll take me home to meet her mom and her dad
Then I asked her to be my bride
And always be right by my side
I felt so happy that I almost cried

And then I kissed her
And then I kissed her
And then I kissed her

 The private life of Bill and Sue
Can you dig what I'm telling you?
No one knows just why we care
We see their faces everywhere

The strangest story you ever knew
The private life of Bill and Sue

From California to Mexico
Everybody's just got to know
Dallas Texas to Monterey
Wasting time on a sunny day

Santa Barbara to Jersey Shore
At the line in the grocery store
Everybody who ever knew
The private life of Bill and Sue

The private life of Bill and Sue
The world is wondering what they do
We watch them on our TV screen
Their lives are like a movie scene




Sometimes life can be so strange
Maybe we're just looking for a change




 There's a story
I want you to know
About my baby
And how I love her so

Oh ohhhh, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
Oh, there's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

Walking down the street
In a crowd
Looking at my baby
Feeling so proud

Woah, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
Woah, there's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

While I was dancing
My baby by my side
Whispered to her
Someday she'll be my bride

Woah, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
Oh no
There's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

(Cindy.)
Cindy
Oh, not like my baby
Sherry
Oh, not like my baby
Wendy
Oh, not like my baby
Ooo-eee

Ooh ho, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
No no
Oh, there's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

(Oh, that's just such a...)
(Wow, that was good.)
(That was really great.)
(... I just love that song.)
(I thought it was really good.)
(Anybody have any cigarettes left?)
( Mike.)
Round...




 Check out the chick with the new dress on
(Wearing a shift and it looks real fine)
They call it a shift and it comes on strong
(Wearing a shift and it looks real fine)
When she's got it on, well she can't do no wrong
(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
You may think a dress can't do very much
(Wearing a shift really turns me on)
With the slit up the side, you can't resist that touch
(Wearing a shift really turns me on)
It's tighter than a moo-moo and it's just too much

(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Can't go wrong now) (go wrong now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (turns me on now)

Get your girl a shift and she'll look real fine
(Wearing a shift and it's just too much)
It fits like a glove and drives you out of your mind
(Wearing a shift and it's just too much)
She'll ball it with her shift on and we'll have a good time
(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)




 There's a moon in the sky somewhere I know
Waiting for all the love to burn below
If you fall and it happens all to soon
Blame it all on the surfer moon
'Neath the hill 'hind the cloud one dreamy night
Rising up, throwing down it's golden light
If your heart hears this melancholy tune
Then you'll know it's the surfer moon
Brings the tide in
Takes it all away
Helps us ride in
Brings us waves each day, I say
Other moons have brought light and love before
Promising to remain for evermore
But they've all disappeared with each new tune
They make way for the surfer moon

Moon
Moon
Moon




 Oh, one more time
(And I didn't want ....)
(Hey Al, ....)
(What?)
(...)
(Al's gonna sing a 'test song.)
(Yeah, sing it for us.)
(Sing a what?)
(A 'test song. It was a protest song until you tried it. Now it's a 'test.)
(Do a little protest.)
(I can't hear you, Ally.)
(Yay, I'm gonna give Al a hand.)
(I can't hear you, Al.)
(Yay for Al.)
(Can't hear you, Al.)
Come gather round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
(Right!) 
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
(Glug.) (Wrong!)
For the times they are a-changing
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
(Right!)
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
(Wrong!)
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no telling who that it's naming
(No!)
Because the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changing
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
("Eve of Destruction")
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changing
(... put on your shoes.)
(Wait a second, where's the note? ...)
Bar, Bar, Bar
(Oh shit...)
Bar, Bar, Bar
(Go back to the piano.)
(F sharp, wasn't it?)
(I can't read. )
(Let's go.)
(What note? What where's the note?)
Ba ba ba, you don't know how to sing, "Ba ba black sheep, have you any wool?"
Yes sir, no sir, none, just a little
(Oh, that was cute.)




 Oh well I'm the type of guy who will never settle down
Where pretty girls are well, you know that I'm around
I kiss 'em and I love'em 'cause to me they're all the same
I hug 'em and I squeeze 'em they don't even know my name
They call me the wanderer yeah the wanderer
I roam around around around...
Oh well there's Flo on my left and there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl with that I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt I got Rosie on my chest
'Cause I'm the wanderer yeah the wanderer
I roam around around around...
Oh well I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
'Til I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron and I'm going nowhere
I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around
I'm never in one place I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine and ride around the world
Yeah I'm the wanderer yeah the wanderer
I roam around around around...
Oh yeah I'm the type of guy that likes to roam around

I roam around around around...
'Cause I'm a wanderer yeah a wanderer
I roam around around around...




 What good is the dawn
That grows into day
The sunset at night
Or living this way

For I have the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
Within me at night
(Within me at night)

The love of my life
She left me one day
I cried when she said
"I don't feel the same way"

Still I have the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
Within me tonight
(Within me tonight)

I'll dream of her arms
And though they're not real
Just like she's still there
The way that I feel

My love's like the warmth of the sun
(Warmth of the sun)
It won't ever die
(It won't ever die)

 The boat rides we would take
The moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite songs
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long
The Midway and the fun
The Cupie dolls we won
The bell I rung to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long
The early morning hike
The rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack
We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back
The leaves began to fade
Like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

 This car of mine
A-win I got (bought) her now she wasn't new
Old and broke down
This car of mine
There's been a lot of races we been through
No slow poke now
I never want to part with her you see
This little car means a heck of a lot to me

(This car of mine, oooooo)
I remember the day
A-when I chose her over all those old broken junkers
Thought I could tell
Underneath a coat of rust she was gold
No clunker
Just couldn't wait to take her home with me
And fix her up just as new as she could be


Ain't no amount of gold any mine
Would be enough to take away this car of mine

(This car of mine, dit til lee hup hup)
This car of mine
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
Oh his car of mine
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
She's so so fine now
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
This car, this car so fine now
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
Mmm she's so fine...




 The tired day is gone
The hotel lights are on
There's stillness in the night, the city's sleeping
As you lie there in your bed
A tune stays in your head
This sleepy lullaby comes softly creeping
Since I can't be there tonight
To hold and squeeze you tight
Oh baby

This song wants to sleep with you
This song wants to sleep with you
This song's going to sleep with you tonight

The melody comes near
And whispers in your ear
Through the misty nights some distant train goes reeling
If I could be anywhere
I'd wish that I was there
And if you should hear 'I love you' that's me singing
This song's a little blue
Because songs get lonely too
Whoa baby


Soft serenade, gives you soul sweet dreams
Pull down the shade, nothing's wrong
(Can't you feel it, can't you feel it)
Guardian angels watch, over you at night
That's really me, and my song, and my soul
The telephone wires hiss
To bring someone a kiss
This melancholy tune is softly fading
Sweet dreams keep coming on
Deep into the dawn
Oh baby


This sleepy lullaby comes softly creeping
This melancholy tune is softly fading
Oh, whoa oh
(This song's going to sleep with you
This song's going to sleep with you)




 I'm thinking about this whole world
Late at night I think about
The love of this whole world
Lots of different people everywhere
And when I go anywhere
I see love, I see love, I see love
When girls get mad at boys and go
Many times they're just putting on a show
But when they leave, you wait alone
You are there like everywhere
Like everyone you see
Happy, because you're living and you're free

Now, here comes another day for your love
(I'm thinking about this whole world)
(This whole world)
Love

Late at night I think about
The love of this whole world




 I'm a cork on the ocean
Floating over the raging sea
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
I lost my way
Hey hey hey
I'm a rock in a landslide
Rolling over the mountainside
How deep is the valley?
How deep is the valley?
It kills my soul
Hey hey hey
I'm a leaf on a windy day
Pretty soon I'll be blown away
How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Ohhhh

Until I die
Until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die

 I looked at you baby
And what did I see
I saw love in your eyes
Made me feel so warm inside

Now look at me baby
And what do you see
You see love in my eyes
Gleaming just for you

And now we know it's
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people

The pine-scented air
Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside
The touch of your cheeks
When they're rosy and cold
Feels so cozy to hold
Just to take you close
And make you warm and



Lying down on our backs
Looking at the sky
Looking down through the valley so
Deep and wide
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Glad we finally got away
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Now I looked around baby
And what do I see
I see love in your eyes
And I'm so glad that we
Finally had some




 I looked at you baby
And what did I see
I saw love in your eyes
Made me feel so warm inside
Now look at me baby
And what do you see
You see love in my eyes
Gleaming just for you
And now we know it's
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together
Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
The pine-scented air
Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside
The touch of your cheeks
When they're rosy and cold
Feels so cozy to hold
Just to take you close
And make you warm and
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together
Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people
Lyin' down on our backs
Lookin' at the sky
Looking down through the valley so
Deep and wide
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Glad we finally got away
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Now I looked around baby
And what do I see
I see love in your eyes
And I'm so glad that we
Finally had some

 What time is it?
How long has it been?
Bubbles and ripples floating through my mind
I must have drifted away
Since I sat down
Where have I been?
The mantra, my mantra must have took me away
It must have took me away
Maharishi gave it to me
And I wonder if it set me free
And it did
And he'll tell you
"sometimes it goes real fast
And other times it goes real slow
Any way you do it it's bound to work I know"
One, two, three, four

Transcendental meditation should be part of your time
It's simple, it's easy as making this rhyme
Transcendental meditation really works for me good
More, much more than I thought it would




 Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo
Well, down in Eugene we got girls and boys
Who wake up on Christmas morning but don't find any toys
If they're lucky their healthy mom and dad come to chat
About how they're missed, but you can change all that
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Yeah, we're the Beach Boys for Crystal Ship and toys
'Cause this Christmas we want you to help spread the joy
It would feel so good, it would make them feel well
It would cheer 'em all up at Children's Hospital
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Christmas toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo




 Hi
Trader

Trader sailed a jewelled crown
Humanity rowed the way
Exploring to command more land
Scheming how to rule the waves
Trader spied a virgin plain
And named it for velvet robes
Wrote home declaring
"There's a place
Where totally folks are free
(Happily completely)
Nourishment fills the prairies and the hillsides
And animals stalk the mountains and the seaside
And fish abound the lakes and birds the skies
Signed sincerely."
Trader found the jewelled land
Was occupied before he came
By humans of a second look
Who couldn't even write their names shame
Trader said they're not as good
As folks who wear velvet robes
Wrote home again and asked, "Please help
Their breasts I see; they're not like me
Banish them from our prairies and our hillsides
Clear them from our mountains and our seaside
I want them off our lakes so please reply
Signed sincerely."
Trader he got the crown okay
Cleared humanity from his way
He civilized all he saw
Making changes every single day say
Shops sprang over the prairies and the hillsides
Then roads cut through the mountains to the seaside
The other kind fled to hide, by and by
And so sincerely
Cried

Making it softly
Like the evening sea, trying to be
Making it go
Creating it gently
Like a morning breeze, a life of ease
Eyes that see
Beyond tomorrow, through to the time without hours
Passing the Eden of Flowers
Reason to live
Embracing together
Like the merging streams, crying dreams
Making it full
Begging intently
For a slight reprieve, a night of ease
Hands to touch
Beyond the sorrow, on to the force without power
Piercing the crust of the tower
Reason to live
Hoping
Like a budding rose, humbling shows
Making it
Struggling lonely
Like a desert field, break the seal, make it real
Ears to hear
Beyond the showers, on to the suns of tomorrows
Burning the flesh of all sorrows
Reason to live
Reason to continue
Reason to go on
Reason to live
Reason to live
Reason to live




 Transcendental meditation
Can emancipate the man
And get you feeling grand

Fusion of the never changing wind
The ever changing wind
The never changing world

It's good

 Boardwalk (i wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (i'm gonna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (i wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk

Ah when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
And the street's so hot you're hoping this whole town is fireproof

Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where i'll be

And when the sun goes down
We'll take a walk along the strand
And as the tide goes out
We'll write "i love you" right there in the sand

Oh i want to go
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where i'll be
Under the boardwalk
Under the boardwalk

Oh oh ohhhh
Under the boardwalk (yeah)
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where i'll be

And when the moon is out
And it's finally cooling down
Don't have to look too far
Because my girl and i just might be found

Oh oh ohhhh
Under the boardwalk (yeah)
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
On a blanket with my baby
That's where i'll be
Ooo i'm on a blanket with my pretty baby
Just you and me

Boardwalk (i wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (i'm gonna take you girl under the) 
Boardwalk (i wanna take you girl under)

My favorite vega-table

 One by one the stars appear
The light of the day is no longer here

One by one the stars disappear
The sky grows brighter
Every minute of the sunrise

Wake the world with a brand new morning
Say hello to another fine morning
Got my face in the running water
Making my life so much brighter
Moon shines bright, asleep in my bed
Like so many people
Got a big day ahead of me

Wake the world with a brand new morning
Say hello to another fine morning
Wouldn't miss it for all of its glory
I'll be there when you're calling me

One by one the stars appear
The light of the day
Is no longer here




 One two three four

If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
I break down and cry
Cry
Cry




 Are you taken by surprise
When your fellow man decides
That what you're doing isn't right
Do you listen, know you're right
Well, you can keep on telling lies
That keep you deaf from people's cries
Well, there's something you should see
We got love to keep us free

We got love, we got love
We got love and we going to change our world, that's right
We got love, we got love
We got love and we going to change our world, that's right

I made my home out in the city
Just to see what I could find
Though my heart was in my country
I was not there to close my eyes
Said, I've been tired of all the same
Must've been a Siren in my head
I've been riding all my feelings
All this running and my temperature won't change

Say, you reap just what you sow
The wise men all have told us so
Trust those feelings deep within
How you must treat your fellow man
Evolution isn't strange
Nature itself demands a change
The universe is on our side
We can't hold back the coming tide




 We know they're right when they say we're not ready
But all we care is how we feel right now
We'll go ahead just the same
Prepare to take the blame

We'll run away and get married anyhow

They warned us that we can't live on love forever
But we just tell them we'll get by somehow
Our problems will be greater
We'll worry about them later


If other kids went through it
Then I know we can do it
If our love is that much stronger
It will last that much longer
It wasn't too long ago when our folks were
Were going through the same thing we are now
But one thing they're forgetting
A thing they're not regretting

They ran away and got married anyhow
(Ran away and got married)
Anyhow
(Ran away and got married)
They ran away and got married anyhow




 Wendy, Wendy what went wrong
Oh so wrong
We went together for so long
I never thought a guy could cry
Until you made it with another guy

Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so bad

Wendy, Wendy don't lose your head
Lose your head
Wendy don't believe a word he says
I can't picture you with him
His future looks awful dim


Wendy I wouldn't hurt you like that
No no no
I thought we had our love down pat
Guess I was wrong
The farthest thing from my mind
Was the day that I'd wake up to find
My Wendy
Wendy left me alone


Wendy, Wendy




 Wendy...Wendy what went wrong...oh, so wrong
We went together for so long

 Wendy, Wendy, what went wrong
Oh so wrong?
We went together for so long

Lose your head
Wendy ,don't believe a word he says

 We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts, we traverse far
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star
Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light
Born a babe on Bethlehem's plain
Gold we bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign
Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to the perfect light
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship God on high
Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to the perfect light

 You know it makes you nervous
When you wait for your boy
You wait nine months for a bundle of joy
There's a baby
Yes, there's a baby about to be born
And someday I'll put my son on my knee
And his little eyes will be looking at me
Then I'll tell him

When a man needs a woman
They make things like you, my son

A man needs a woman
Like a woman needs a man
When the two get together
Oh oh, ho ho ho ho!
Pretty soon we'll be a family of three
Then it's not going to be just you and me
We'll share all the goodies
With the one we bring in the world




 When girls get together
They like to talk about their latest love
And their description seems somehow to fit just like a glove
When girls get together
They don't waste time on things like weather and stuff
They all just play around and never seem to discuss it enough
This must have been going on prehistory
They may not ever solve the mystery
But they'll go talk until eternity
When girls get together
And bring up father or brother or men of their lives
It means so much if she's your sister or your mother or your loving wife
I guess we guys might never really know
How good we've got it but we'd like to show
Just how much that we love them so
One bright springtime morning
I overheard an elderly lady's voice
As I walked by her bench she told her friends of her great loss
After they'd gone away
Three little girls came skipping through the park
Talking of little boys and getting home before it's dark
When girls get together




 When I grow up to be a man
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man?
Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
(14, 15)
Will I settle down fast or will I first want to travel the world?
(16, 17)
Well, I'm young and free, but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Will my kids be proud or think their old man's really a square?
(18, 19)
When they're out having fun, yeah, will I still wanna have my share?
(20, 21)
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?
(22, 23)
Won't last forever
(24, 25)
It's kind of sad
(26, 27)
Won't last forever
(28, 29)
It's kind of sad
(30, 31)
Won't last forever




 When I grow up to be a man
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds

When I grow up to be a man?

Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
(fourteen fifteen
Will I settle down fast or will I first want to travel the world?

Now I'm young and free, but how will it be


Oooooo Ooooooo Oooooooo
Will my kids be proud or think their old man is really a square?
(eighteen nineteen
When they're out having fun yeah, will I still want to have my share?
(twenty twenty-one
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life


(twenty-two twenty-three
Won't last forever
(twenty-four twenty-five
It's kind of sad
(twenty-six twenty-seven
Won't last forever
(twenty-eight twenty-nine
It's kind of sad
(thirty thirty-one
Won't last forever
(thirty-two




 When I grow up to be a man
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man?
Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
(14, 15)
Will I settle down fast or will I first want to travel the world?
(16, 17)
Well, I'm young and free, but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Will my kids be proud or think their old man's really a square?
(18, 19)
When they're out having fun, yeah, will I still wanna have my share?
(20, 21)
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?
(22, 23)
Won't last forever
(24, 25)
It's kind of sad
(26, 27)
Won't last forever
(28, 29)
It's kind of sad
(30, 31)
Won't last forever




 I've spent my whole life drifting
Towards an elusive sun
I would have wandered forever
If your breeze hadn't come
And you just could be my anchor
You are my northern star
That navigates me home

Don't need to search no more exotic islands
No that I found you're right where I belong
Never been so much at home as I am
Loving you is right where I belong

In my mind we're together
Even when I'm alone
My heart leaves you never
Never will our love grow old
My destination forever
You are my shining star that navigates me home




 (whistling)
Whistle in
(All Day)
Remember the day-day?
(All night)
Remember the night-night?
(All day)
All day long
(All through the night)
Whistle in




 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

 Sweet sweet wild honey bee
Eat up eat up eat up honey

Mama I'm telling you as sure as
I'm standing here
She's my girl and that's the way
I'm keeping it now mama dear
No good will it do you to stand there
And frown at me
The girl's got my heart
And my love's coming down on me
My love's coming down since
I got a taste of wild honey
You know she's got the sweetness
Of a honey bee wild honey
She got it on and stung me good yes sirree
With all the other stud bees
Buzzing all around her hive
She singled me out
Single handed took me alive
Well can you can you gonna take my life
Eating up her wild honey


Oh mama she's sweeter
Getting sweeter
Sweeter sweeter
Sweet

Wild honey
Let me tell you how she really got to my soul
It ain't funny
The way she make wanna sing a little rock 'n' roll
There's nothing quite nice as a kiss of wild honey
I break my back working just to save me some money
So I can spend my life with her
Sock it to me wild honey

Wild honey she's mine




 Hanging down from my window
Those are my wind chimes

Wind chimes 

In the late afternoon you're
Hung up on wind chimes


Though it's hard I try
Not to look at my wind chimes

Now and then a tear rolls on my cheek

On a warm breeze the little bells
Tinkling wind chimes


Close your eyes and lean back
Listen to wind chimes


It's so peaceful
Close to a lullabye

The wind chimes tingling
Tingling
The wind chimes tingling
Tingling
Da do do da do do da do do da do do

Whispering winds send my wind chimes a tinkling 




 Hanging down from my window
Those are my wind chimes
In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes
Now and then a tear rolls off my cheek
On the warm breeze the little bells
Tinkle like wind chimes
Close your eyes and lean back now listen to wind chimes




 Hanging down from my window
Those are my wind chimes
In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes

Tinkle like wind chimes

 Winds of change blow 'round my door
Is this the year I've been waiting for?
Worlds in motion endlessly
Cosmic ocean flows into my heart
Part of me would like to be (would like to be)
A shining lighthouse for all to see (for all to see)
When the dark night hides the sun
Shine a light for everyone to see
Isn't that the way it should be?
I am no stranger to a world of change
There are always situations to rearrange
But there's something special 'bout this quiet dawn
It seems to sing a song to everyone
It's dawning on and on and on
Of change are here at last (are here at last)
The clouds have lifted, the storm has passed (the storm has passed)

Nights we've known are on the run
And there's a bright and shining sun
For everyone to see
Winds of change
(Won't last forever)
(Won't last forever)
(Won't last forever)




 Autumn colors have gone
Birds fled south with their song
Snowflakes cover the earth quietly
Night extends through the hours
Coolly lit by the stars
The pulse of life slows silently
Cuddle up in a cozy nook
With a warm drink and a book
Within a winter symphony
Somewhere children outside
Screamin' down a daredevil slide
Rosy-cheeked bundles of cold-weather clothes
Hear the winter winds howl
Pierced by the hoot of an owl
Fingers of frost take a nip at my nose
Cuddle up in a cozy nook
With a warm drink and a book
Within a winter symphony
Winter symphony
Snowflake fantasy
Warms my heart like a tropic sea
There the sun always shines
There you'll always be mine
All in a winter symphony
Winter symphony
Snowflake fantasy
Warms my heart like a tropic sea
There the sun always shines
There you'll always be mine
All in a winter symphony




 What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?
No I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm get high with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm get high with a little help from my friends
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends

 She belongs there left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the one, one, wonderful
She knew how to gather the forest when
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket, quite young and
Loving her mother and father
Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess, the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her one, one, wonderful
All fall down and lost in the mystery
Lost it all to a non-believer
And all that's left is a girl
Who's loved by her mother and father
She'll return in love with her liberty
Just away from the non-believer
She'll sigh and thank God for one, one, wonderful

 Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)

Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
They're playing our song
Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
Please don't keep me long

I've been anticipating, seeing you all day long
And all the while I'm waiting
I find myself a-singing this little song


Soon as the music start playing
I start to thinking of you
That's when you'll hear me saying
Pretty please, baby, here's what I ask of you


Late at night when I'm sleeping
I get to dreaming of you
That's when I find myself scheming
Of ways that I can spend all my nights with you

Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)




 Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)
Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice
Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby
Good night my baby
Sleep tight my baby

 I need a breeze blowing softly
To keep my wind vane from standing
I need a whole lot of sunshine
To keep my sundial advancing
I need some soil before my grass will grow
I need some spark to make my candle glow

Relief I cried
There is no shuck 'n' jive
I need a mess of help to stand alone

I need a spark by a fire
To stop the cold of my winter
I need a burst of your raindrops
To keep a flow in my river
I need a call for my phone will ring
I need your song for my voice will sing
Please realize
I'm not half alive
Without a mess of help to stand alone

(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)

I need the warmth of your smile
To heat my frostbitten sorrow
I need your hand on my shoulder
To lead today's to tomorrows
I need your strength to lock me to the track
I need your trust to bust the things I lack




 You're kind of small
And you're such a doll
I'm glad you're mine
You're so good to me
How come you are
You take my hand
And you understand
When I get in a bad mood
You're so good to me
And I love it, love it

You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah

I know your eyes
Are not on the guys
When we're apart
You're so true to me
How come you are
And every night
You hold me so tight
When I kiss you goodbye
You're so good to me
And I love it, love it


You're my baby

 It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide I
Don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song
And this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that
Keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but
Now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world




 Drive your car down to the sea
All the while you build a scheme
Take her hand and walk on with her

Make it real, your summer dream

Smell the warm and salty air
See a wave reflect a beam
Stop and find a pretty shell for her


See another couple over there
To them an ordinary day
Soon you wonder where the time has gone
The sun has almost slipped away
Now it's gone and you're alone
In her eyes you see a gleam
Time has come for you to show your love




 I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me
Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me
I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully

You still believe in me
I want to cry

But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me
I wanna cry...




 I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me
Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be
You still believe in me
I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me
I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me
I wanna cry...

 (All right.)
Here I stand
(There you go.)
Head in hand...
(Denny!)
Hide your tears
(Let him sing it)
(Oh!)
(He knows it better than I do.)
Ooom pom pom
(King Arthur!)
Here I stand, head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two foot small
(Shhhhhhhhh!)
(This is great!)
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

(Go!)
Hey! You've got to hide your love away
(Hey hey.)

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hear them, see them
In the state I'm in
(Be quiet)
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way"
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say


Do do doooo do-do-do
Doo bum bum do do
Do do dooo do
Dooo do-do-do
Do do do-do do do doooooo

(Wow, that was good)
(Wow, that's great!)
(That was really good.)
Hey! Somebody hid my teeth away
(Just call that number...)
Hey! Somebody hid my teeth away
(Everly Brothers.)
(Hey!)
(What's the best Everly Brothers song? Besides, ah...)
(Go.)
("Bird Dog.")
(Who's going to fool with it?)
(You're going to fool with it. You and me.)
(You shouldn't fool with an Everly Brothers song you should do it right.)
(Just like we fooled with "Wake Up Little Susie.")
(No, ah, "Devoted To You.")
("Devoted To You." Well, Carl, do you know the guitar part?)
(Yeah.)
(You must know the guitar part.)
(Here, I've got it right here.)
(He's gotta go check the ... now.)
(That's it!)
(How are you going to sing a slow song like that one if nobody will shut up?)
(Hey, be quiet will ya?)
(Just die your hair bright red.)
(Hey, shh, just be quiet and let us sing it.)
(Just shut up for a little while because Brian and I are gonna sing it.)
(If you don't know it, then shut up and go home!)
(Yes!)
