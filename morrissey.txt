All the lazy dykes
Cross-armed at the Palms
Then legs astride their bikes
Indigo burns on their arms
One sweet day
An emotional whirl
You will be good to yourself
And you'll come and join the girls
All the lazy dykes
They pity how you live
Just "somebody's wife"
You give, and you give
And you give, and you give
Give, and you give
And one sweet day
An emotional whirl
You will be good to yourself
And you'll come and join the girls
Touch me, squeeze me
Hold me too tightly
And when you look at me you actually see me
And I've never felt so alive
In the whole of my life
In the whole of my life
Free yourself, be yourself
Come to the Palms and see yourself
And at last your life begins
At last your life begins
At last your life begins
At last your life begins




 Spend more on nuclear war
If that's your chosen illusion
Incinerate innocent men and women and children
The kids around here have the best idea
They say presidents come, presidents go
But all the young people they must fall in love
All the young people they must fall in love
Presidents come, presidents go
And oh look at the damage they do

They never stop talking
They aren't allowed to say
They can't say what they really mean
Do you ever say what you really mean?
Presidents come, presidents go
And oh look at the damage they do
All the young people they must fall in love
So what do you want to do?
It's up to you
Presidents come, presidents go
And nobody remembers their name two weeks after they go
All the young people they must fall in love
All the young people they must fall in love
All the young people they must fall in love, in love, in love, in love, in love




 You hiss and groan and you constantly moan
But you don't ever go away
And that's because
All you need is me

You roll your eyes up to the skies
Mock horrified
But you're still here
All you need is me

There's so much destruction
All over the world
And all you can do is
Complain about me

You bang your head against the wall
And say you're
Sick of it all
Yet you remain
'Cause all you need is me

And then you offer your one and only joke
And you ask me what will I be
When I grow up to be a man
Me? Nothing!..


There's a soft voice singing in your head
Who can this be?
I do believe it's me

There's a naked man standing, laughing in your dreams
You know who it is
But you don't like what it means

There's so much destruction
All over the world
And all you can do is
Complain about me

I was a small, fat child in a welfare house
There was only one thing I ever dreamed about
And fate has just
Handed it to me - whoopee


You don't like me, but you love me
Either way you're wrong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You don't like me, but you love me
Either way you're wrong
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone




 So, the choice I have made
May seem strange to you
But who asked you, anyway?
It's my life to wreck
My own way

You see to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole

So, the life I have made
May seem wrong to you
But, I've never been surer
It's my life to ruin
My own way

You see to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole
Because to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
In part, and in whole

To someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
Part, and in whole
So to someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Alma matters
In mind, body and soul
Part, and in whole

To someone, somewhere, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah




 Were you and he lovers?
And would you say so if you were?
On a forecourt
On a Friday
Passing my way

Were you and he lovers?
And if you were, then say that you were!
On a groundsheet
Under canvas
With your tent-flap
Open wide

A note upon his desk:
"P.S. Bring me home and have me!"
Leather elbows on a tweed coat
Oh!
Is that the best you can do?

So came his reply:
"...but on the desk is where I want you!"
So I ask (even though I know):
"Were you and he lovers?"




 Bolt-lock your doors
Alarm your cars
And still we move in closer
Every day
Top of the list
Is your smiling kids
But we'll be smiling too
So that's OK
Oh, and by the way
Thank you, because you're
Giving, giving, giving
And we're receiving - no, no, we're taking
Keeping the population down

Your taxes paid, but
Police waylaid
And we knows
When the school bus
Comes and goes
We're on your street, but
You don't see us
Or, if you do
You smile and say hello
But don't underestimate us
When you are
Giving, giving, giving
And we're receiving -no, no, we're taking
Just keeping
The population down

You're giving, giving, giving
Well, it's your own fault
For reproducing

We're just keeping
The population down




 America your head's too big
Because America, your belly is too big
And I love you, I just wish you'd stay where you belong

In America
The land of the free, they said
And of opportunity
In a just and a truthful way
But where the president, is never black, female or gay,
And until that day
You've got nothing to say to me
To help me believe

In America, it brought you the hamburger
Oh well America you know where you can shove your hamburger
And don't you wonder why in Estonia they say
Hey you, big fat pig, you fat pig, you fat pig
Steely blue eyes with no love in them scan the world
And a humourless smile, with no warmth within, greets the world
And I, I have got nothing, to offer you
No-no-no-no-no
Just this heart deep and true, which you say you don't need
See with your eyes, touch with your hands, please
Hear through your ears, know in your soul, please
For haven't you me with you now?
And I love you, I love you, I love you
And I love you, I love you, I love you




 I know these roads
Each ridge and narrow bridge
Each chevron
Enticing me on
Each warning sign
I take in my stride

I don't need more ammunition
I've got more than I can spend
I don't dwell on things I'm missing
I'm just pleased
With the things I've found

I know these roads
An old hand understands
Above all, I know what's
Expected of me now
Veering cliffwards

I don't need more ammunition
I've got more than I can spend
I don't dwell on things I'm missing
I'm just pleased
With the things I've found
With the things I've found
With the things I've found
I've found

I've been crying
It comes back on these salient days
And it stays
And it says:
"We've never really been away"

I don't need more ammunition
I've got more than I can spend
I don't think of who I'm missing
I've got no space and no time
In my life, anymore
No space or time
In my life, anymore
For revenge




 Angel, Angel
Don't take your life tonight

I know they take
And that they take in turn
And they give you nothing real
For yourself in return
But when they've used you
And they've broken you
And wasted all your money
And cast your shell aside
And when they've bought you
And they've sold you
And they've billed you for the pleasure
And they've made your parents cry

I will be here
Oh, believe me
I will be here
Believe me

Angel, don't take your life
Some people have got no pride
They do not understand
The urgency of life
But I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life
I love you more than life




 Art-hounds look like nothing
So Art-hounds write something
And those that do are judged by those
Who tried and found they couldn't do
Art-hounds see the Greek ideal
And gaze on what they'll never feel
Oh, the pitiless revenge of those without friends
The pitiless, the pitiless revenge
Art-hounds know what's around
Because they've seen it somewhere written down
And everything they've seen on the moving screen
Helps them fill up the page

In European museums
Will I see you?
Will I see you?
Will I see you?
Will I see you?

Will I see you?
My life is opera

Art-hounds in a restaurant
They bring along their loving Aunt
But when they can't find a table for their fat Aunt Mable
They stamp their feet and cry

I take 16 pills to send me to sleep
And 16 pills to shake me awake

 Day oh so late
Strangely the sun still shone
Ooh Asian boy
What are you on?
Day oh so late
Strangely the sun still shone
Oh Asian boy
What are drugs are you on?
Oh... Strange
Tooled-up Asian boy
Has come to take revenge
For the cruel, cold killing
Of his very best friend
Tooled-up Asian boy
Has come to avenge
The cruel, cold killing
Of his only friend
Ha! La, la, la, oh...
There's peace through our school
It's so quiet in the hall
It's a strange sign for one
Of what's to come
Tough and cold and pale
Oh, they may just impale you on railings
Oh, English boys
It must be wrong
Three against one?
Oh...
Brakes slammed, and
His gun jammed, and
As far as I could tell
Brave Asian boy
Was dealt a blow and fell
I'm just passing through here
On my way to somewhere civilized
And maybe I'll even arrive
Maybe I'll even arrive




 I am angry, I am ill and I'm as ugly as sin
I don't know what keeps me alive and kicking
I know the meaning of life it doesn't help me a bit
I know beauty and I know a good thing when I speak it
This is a song from under the floorboards
Here is a song from where the wall is cracked
My force of habit?
I am an insect
And I must confess I'm very proud of that
I have known the highest and I've known the best
I accord death all of its due respect
But the brightest jewel inside of me
Glows with pleasure at my own stupidity
This is a song from under the floorboards
Here is a song from where the wall is cracked
My force of habit?
I am an insect
And I must confess I'm very proud of that
I used to make phantoms I could later chase
Images of all that could be desired
Then I got tired of counting all of these so called blessings
And then I just got tired
This is a song from under the floorboards
Here is a song from where the wall is cracked
My force of habit?
I am an insect
And I must confess I'm very proud of that
This is a song from under the floorboards
Here is a song from where the wall is cracked
My force of habit?
I am an insect
And I must confess I'm very proud of that
Habit, habit, habit
Habit, habit




 I'm calling you from the foyer
Of the Sands Hotel
Where the men and the women
Are acquainted quite well
And the drunkards keep on drinking
And oh, my room is cold
I'm disputing the bill
I will sleep in my clothes
And you, my invalid friend
You slam the receiver when you say
"If I had your limbs for a day
I would steam away"
I'm calling you from the foyer
Of this awful hotel
Where the slime and the grime
Gel
And I cannot - or, I do not
And oh, my room is cold
And I'm envying you never having to choose
And you, my invalid friend
You slam the receiver when you say
"If I had your limbs for a day
I would steam away"
I'm calling you from the foyer
Of the Sands Hotel
It's not low-life, it's just people
Having a good time
And oh, my invalid friend
Oh, my invalid friend
In our different ways we are
The same




 At last I am born
Historians note
I am finally born
I once used to chase affection withdrawn
But now I just sit back and yawn
Because I am born, born, born
"Look at me now
From difficult child
To spectral hand to Claude Brasseur
Oh blah blah blah..."
At last I am born
Vulgarians know
I am finally born
I once thought that time accentuates despair
But now I don't actually care
Because I am born, born, born
"Look at me now
From difficult child
To spectral hand to Claude Brasseur
Oh blah blah blah..."
At last I am born
At last I am born
Living the one true free life born
I once thought I had numerous reasons to cry
And I did, but I don't anymore
Because I am born, born, born
At last I am born
At last I am born
It took me a long, long time
But now I am born
I once was a mess of guilt because of the flesh
It's remarkable what you can learn
Once you are born, born, born
Born, born, born
Born, born, born




 Because of my poor education
I don't expect your invitation
A ship lost inches away from the bay
Because of my poor education
I can't endure my situation
This here is my bed and I must lie
Because of this strange indentation
I live my life without affection
Kindhearted view me and say
Thank God, that's not me
Once I was sure I had found my hero
And I allowed myself to think so
Reality is not real to me




 Bengali, Bengali
Bengali, Bengali
No, no, no
He does not want to depress you
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
He only wants to impress you
Oh...
Bengali in platforms
He only wants to embrace your culture
And to be your friend forever
Forever (forever)

Bengali, Bengali
Bengali, Bengali
Oh, shelve your Western plans
And understand
'Cause life is hard enough when you belong here

A silver-studded rim that glistens
And an ankle-star that blinds me
A lemon sole so very high
Which only reminds me - to tell you
Break the news gently
Break the news to him gently
"Shelve your plans, shelve your plans, shelve them"

Bengali, Bengali
It's the touchy march of time that binds you
Don't blame me
Don't hate me
Just because I am the one to tell you
That life is hard enough when you belong here
That life is hard enough when you belong here

Oh...
Shelve your Western plans
Oh...
Shelve your Western plans

'Cause life is hard enough when you belong
Life is hard enough when you belong here
Oh...
Shelve your Western plans
Oh...
Shelve your best friends
'Cause life is hard when you belong here
Oh...
Life is hard enough when you belong

 Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said I'd like to smash every tooth
In your head
Oh ... sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking
When I said by rights you should be
Bludgeoned in your bed
And now I know how joan of arc felt
Now I know how joan of arc felt, oh
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her walkman started to melt
Oh ...
Bigmouth, la ... bigmouth, la ...
Bigmouth strikes again
I've got no right to take my place
In the human race
Oh, bigmouth, ha ha ... bigmouth, la
Bigmouth strikes again
I've got no right to take my place
In the human race
And now I know how joan of arc felt
Now I know how joan of arc felt, oh
As the flames rose to a roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt
Eek !

 Say, Billy Budd
So you think you should?
Oh, everyone's laughing
Say, Billy Budd
So you think that you should?
Everyone's laughing!
Since I took up with you
Things have been bad
Yeah, but now it's 12 years on
Now it's 12 years on
Yes, and I took up with you

I took my job application into town
Did you hear? They turned me down
Yes, and it's all because of us
Oh, and what was in our eyes
Oh, what was in our eyes, yeah

I said, Billy Budd
I would happily lose
Both of my legs
I would lose both of my legs
Oh, if it meant you could be free
Oh, if it meant you could be free
(Don't leave us in the dark!)




 The one I love
Is standing near
The one I love
Is everywhere

I can woo you
I can amuse you
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud

The one I love
Roosts in the mind
Can snap this spell
Or increase hell

I can chase you
And I can catch you
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud
Oh, black cloud
Oh, black cloud

I play the game of favorites now
I can, I must
I will, I do

And I can please you
Or, I can freeze you out
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine
Black cloud, black cloud, black cloud

I can choke myself to please you
And I can sink much lower than usual
But there's nothing I can do
To make you mine




 Black-eyed Susan
You make us nervous
Because we're very aware that you do not care
Black-eyed Susan
What don't you believe in?
"No is always easier than Yes"
Black-eyed Susan
You must insist:
You are a born-again atheist, oh
Oh, heavy-rings on
Bitten fingers
Black-eyed Susan sometimes
Shakes to break
So, watch it
Black-eyed Susan
Rest and do nothing
'Cause it's the only thing that you do quite well
Black-eyed Susan
Please remember
We were the first
We were the first




 Losing in front of your home crowd
You wished the ground would open up
And take you down
And will time never pass
Will time
Never pass
For us
Your weary wife is walking away
Your nephew is true
Well, he thinks the world of you
And I have to close my eyes
Losing in front of your home town
The crowd call your name
They love you
All the same
The sound, the smell, and the spray
You will take them all away
And they'll stay till the grave
Your weary wife is walking away
Your nephew is true
Well, he thinks the world of you
And I have to close my eyes
Losing in your home town
Hell is the bell
That will not ring again
You will return one day
Oh, because of all the things
That you see
When your eyes close
Your weary wife walking away
Your nephew is true
He still thinks the world of you
And I have to dry my eyes




 The strange logic of your clumsiest line
It stayed emblazoned on my mind
You say break up the family
And let's begin to live our lives
I went to see all my friends tonight
It wasn't youth, it wasn't life
Born old, sadly wise
Resigned (well, we were)
To ending our lives
I'm so glad to grow older
To move away from those awful times
I want to see all my friends tonight
Yes you found love but you weren't
At peace with your life
Home late, full of hate
Despise the ties that bind
I'm so glad to grow older
To move away from those younger years
I'm in love for the first time
And I don't feel bad
Let me see all my old friends
Let me put my arm around them
Because I really do love them
Now, does that sound mad?
Captain of games, solid framed
I stood on the touchline
Hailstones, driven home
In his car—no breaks? I don't mind
I'm just so glad to grow older
To move away from those darker years
I'm in love for the first time
And I don't feel bad
So wish me luck my friends
Goodbye




 I take the cue from certain people I know
I use the cue and then I hand it on to you
And when I swing it so it catches his eye
Weren't you there, you'd have died
I trust the views of certain people I know
They look at danger and they laugh their heads off
Their clothes are an imitation George XXIII
Don't you find this absurd?
I'd hate to be like certain people I know
They break their necks and can't afford to get them fixed
They'd sacrifice all of their principles for
Anything cashable
I do believe it's terrible
Oh-woah-woah
Oh-woah-woah
Oh-woah-woah




 Children in pieces
In Irish industrial schools
Nuns called mothers
And their christian brothers
Kick the shit out of very frightened children
Judges and priests and police and cardinals
They look the other way
When the weekend comes they'll make you suffer
Children in pieces
In Irish industrial schools
Nuns called mothers
And their christian brothers
Kick the shit out of very frightened children
You say you wanna go home
You say you wanna be left alone
And so you turn to me
But instead of sympathy I find
My sentimental heart hardens
My sentimental heart hardens
Get your hands off me
Kid, you must be bad luck
My sentimental heart hardens




 Christian Dior
You wasted your life
On aroma and clothes
Fabric and dyes
Christian Dior
You wasted your life
On grandeur and style
Making the poor rich smile
You could have run wild
On the backstreets of Lyon or Marseille
Reckless and legless and stoned
Impregnating women
Or kissing mad street boys from Napoli
Who couldn't even write their own name
Christian Dior
You wasted your life
Sensually stroking the weaves of a sleeve
You could have run wild
On the backstreets of Lyon or Marseille
Reckless and legless and stoned
Impregnating women
Or kissing mad street boys from Napoli
Who couldn't even spell their own name
Oh, Christian Dior
Oh, Christian Dior
When you look at me
Failure is all that you see
I discipline my days just like Christian Dior
I could've run loudly and proudly
Or forcible entry
Morally bankrupt
And never non-violent
And drawn to what scares me
And scared of what bores me
Years alone will never be returned
Christian Dior
Lyonise maverick, ah
Design if you can, ah
The way to just be a man, ah
To just be a man, ah




 There is something I wanted to tell you
It's so funny you'll kill yourself laughing
But then I, I look around
And I remember that I am alone
Alone
For evermore

The tile yard all along the railings
Up a discoloured dark brown staircase
Here you'll find, despair and I
Calling to you with what's left of my heart
My heart
For evermore

Drinking tea with the taste of the Thames
Sullenly on a chair on the pavement
Here you'll find, my thoughts and I
And here is the very last plea from my heart
My heart
For evermore

Where taxi drivers never stop talking
Under slate grey Victorian sky
Here you will find, despair and I
And here I am every last inch of me is yours
Yours
For evermore

Your leg came to rest against mine
Then you lounged with knees up and apart
And me and my heart, we knew
We just knew
For evermore

Where taxi drivers never stop talking
Under slate grey Victorian sky
Here you'll find, my heart and I
And still we say come back
Come back to Camden
And I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be good




 I was dancing when i was twelve
I was dancing when i was twelve
I was dancing when i was ... oh
I was dancing when i was ... oh
I danced myself out of the womb
I danced myself out of the womb
Is it strange to dance so soon ?
Is it strange to dance so soon ?
Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man ?
What's it like to be a loon ?
I liken it to a balloon
Oh ...
I danced myself into the tomb
I danced myself into the tomb
Is it strange to dance so soon ?
Is it strange to dance so soon ?
Is it wrong to understand
The fear that dwells inside a man ?
What's it like to be a loon ?
I liken it to a balloon
Oh ...




 Head in the clouds, and a mouthful of pie
Head in a blouse, everybody loves him
I see why

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave
Oh, Dagenham Dave

"I love Karen, I love Sharon" on the windowscreen
With never the need to fight or to question a single thing

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave
Oh, Dagenham Dave

Dagenham Dave, Dagenham Dave
Oh, Dagenham Dave

Dagenham Dave

He'd love to touch, he's afraid that he might self-combust
I could say more, but you get the general idea

 I am walking through Rome
With my heart on a string
Dear God, please help me
And I am so very tired
Of doing the right thing
Dear God, please help me
There are explosive kegs
Between my legs
Dear God, please help me

Will you follow and know
Know me more than you do
Track me down
And try to win me?
Then he motions to me
With his hand on my knee
Dear God, did this kind of thing happen to you?

Now I'm spreading your legs
With mine in-between
Dear God, if I could I would help you
And now I am walking through Rome
And there is no room to move
But the heart feels free
The heart feels free
The heart feels free
But the heart feels free
The heart feels free
The heart feels free




 Further into the fog I fall
Well, I was just following you
When you said, "Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
Dial-A-Cliché
"Grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
Dial-A-Cliché
Dial-A-Cliché
Dial-A-Cliché
But the person underneath
Where does he go?
Does he slide by the wayside?
Or does he just die?
And you find that you've organized
Your feelings, for people
Who didn't like you then
And do not like you now
But still you say, "Do as I do and scrap your fey ways"
Dial-A-Cliché
"Grow up, be a man, and close your mealy-mouth!"
Dial-A-Cliché
"The safe way is the only way"
"There's always time to change, son"
I've changed, but I'm in pain
Dial-A-Cliché




 Our unsleepable friend
Gets the message on an ill-wind
All your friends and your foes
Would rather die than have to touch you
To say the least, truly disappointed
Truly, truly, truly ah-ha-ha

Drank too much
And I've said too much
And there's nowhere to go, but down
Young boy, I wanna help you
See these lines? Truly disappointed
Truly, truly, truly ah-ha-ha

Don't talk to me now
About people who are nice
'Cause I have spent my whole life in ruins
Because of people who were nice
Oh, this world may lack style, I know
Each bud must blossom and grow

Young girl one day you will be old
But the thing is, I love you now
This is the last song I will ever sing (Yeah)
No, I've changed my mind again (Ooooh)
Goodnight and thank you

Goodnight
And thank you (Morrissey!)




 Long ago when he was young and restless
Suddenly, Daddy saw the beckoning finger of fate

Don't make fun of Daddy's voice
Because he can't help it
When he was a teenage boy
Something got stuck in his throat

When you are young you crave affection
And it can come from the strangest direction

Don't make fun of Daddy's voice
Because he can't help it
When he was a teenage boy
Something got stuck in his throat

Don't make fun of Daddy's voice
Because he can't help it
When he was a teenage boy
Something got stuck in his throat
No te divertes con papi
No te divertes con papi
No te divertes con papi
No te divertes con papi
No te divertes con papi, no




 Compare the best of their days
With the worst of your days
You won't win
With your standards so high
And your spirits so low
At least remember
This is you on a bad day, you on a pale day

Just do your best and don't...
Don't worry, oh
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair

See the best of how they look
Against the worst of how you are
And again, you won't win
With your standards so high
And your spirits so low
At least remember
This is you on a drab day, you in a drab dress

Just do your best and don't...
Don't worry, oh
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair

Just do your best and don't...
Don't worry, oh
The way you watch yourself is oh, so unfair

Just do your best and don't...
Don't worry, oh
The way you hang yourself is oh, so unfair

Just do your best and don't...
Don't worry, oh
Just do your best and, ohh ohhh




 Drag the river and within her you may find a sliver
Of the one of whom you speak and whom they seek
She would gaze into the river as we’d look into a mirror

And her reflection would beckon her to
Join me join me join me join me
Happy we will be

On the coastal shore I’m sure you’d break down if you saw
An abhorrent torrent crashing as it pours
The counter current holds a secret at the rise of tides

And it swells all alone for this heart born too high
So join me join me join me join me
I’m certain I heard her cry

By the river with the soul of submersible stone
Every second of my life prepares to go
She would call into the river as she’d cry out for her mother

So stark, so haunt, deep enough for all I was
Oh join us join us join us join us
And happy we will be




 Let me put my arms around your head
It's hot, let's go to bed
And don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh, this will be alright
Going towards another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book, we can read up alone
And try, try like once before
When people stared
In David Johansen's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and he'd ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Chris the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she's got to have him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
Neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation
'Mid this fall out saturation
Cursing at the Astronettes
That stand in seal by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The bureau supply for aging men
With snorting heads he gazes to the shore
Once it raged, the sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and he'd ask to stay
And she'd sigh like Chris the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and he'd ask to stay
When she'd sigh like Chris the Wonder Kid
And she'd turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday
It's a drive-in Saturday

 I'm driving
Your girlfriend home
And she's saying
How she never chose you
"Turn left," she says
I turn left
And she says:
"So how did I end up
So deeply involved in
The very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
And I can't answer

I'm driving
Your girlfriend home
And she's laughing
To stop herself crying
"Drive on", she says
I drive on
And she says:
"So how did I end up
Attached to this person
When his sense of humour
Gets gradually worser?"
And I can't tell her

I'm parking
Outside her home
And we're shaking hands
Goodnight, so politely




 Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Day after day you say one day
Day after day you say one day
But you're in the wrong place, and you've got the wrong face
And humans are not really very humane
And earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Live with a loneness that no one else knows
Time after time you say next time, next time
Time after time you say next time, next time
But you fail as a woman, and you lose as a man
We do what we can
And Earth is the cruelest place that you will never understand
But you're in the wrong skin
And the skin that you're in says
Oh, let it begin
And Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Day after day you say one day
Day after day you say one day
But there’s always a reason why you’re refused
They always blame you, you, you
And there is nothing anyone can do




 East west, over the ocean
Perpetual motion, traveling around
No rest singing and playing
Night out and day in doing the rounds
What a great life this must seem
Swelled joints, every thing classy
Nothing is tacky, only the best
Lush girls, older and dying
Sighing and crying, 'This is success'
What a great life this must seem
But when I hear your voice singing out
The bells of home are ringing out
And I feel all alone
(And I think of my home)
Cold times a wind through the houses
The bleakness arouses a longing to leave
Time flew, I wanted to see you
Somehow I could not do because of success
What a strange life this can be
But when I hear your voice singing out
The bells of home are ringing out
And I feel all alone
(And I think of my home)




 Trudging slowly over wet sand
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen
This is the coastal town
That they forgot to close down
Armageddon - come Armageddon!
Come, Armageddon! Come!

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Hide on the promenade
Etch a postcard :
"How I Dearly Wish I Was Not Here"
In the seaside town
That they forgot to bomb
Come, come, come, nuclear bomb

Everyday is like Sunday
Everyday is silent and grey

Trudging back over pebbles and sand
And a strange dust lands on your hands
And on your face...
On your face...
On your face...
On your face...

Everyday is like Sunday
"Win yourself a cheap tray"
Share some greased tea with me
Everyday is silent and grey




 So then you've found your place
You say I wanna be the first
Stand up comedian in outer space
But then in a fantastic bird
Fantastic bird

Space is gonna thrill you, space could even kill you
But space will never love you like I do

Reflecting light down to earth
Oh yes and then some humor too
Just enough to make us know we don't miss you
Have you checked suspension in the fantastic bird?
Fantastic bird

Science can engulf you, science then propels you
But science will never love you like I do

What brings you down to earth?
Ah yes, of course, yes, yes, it was a lack of applause
Scrap metal for a fantastic bird
Fantastic bird

Science propels you, science still engulfs you
But science will never love you like I do
'Cause when you land all you do I hear is my voice
Hello, welcome I love you, don't you see?
Don't you see?




 Los Angeles, you are too hot

You have never been in love
Until you have seen the stars
Reflect in the reservoirs
And you have never been in love
Until you have seen the dawn rise
Behind the home for the blind

We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our streets
Where Hector was the...

First of the gang with a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die
Oh my
Hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die
Oh my

You have never been in love
Until you've seen the sunlight thrown
Over smashed human bone

We are the pretty petty thieves
And you're standing on our streets
Where Hector was the

First of the gang with a gun in his hand
And the first to do time
The first of the gang to die
Such a silly boy
Hector was the first of the gang
With a gun in his hand
And the bullet in his gullet
And the first lost lad to go
Under the sod

And he stole from the rich and the poor
And not very rich and the very poor
And he stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
Away
He stole all hearts away
Away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
Away
He stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away
Away




 Use a weapon of words
Or a fight with your fists
But can you forgive someone?
Stand your ground and persist
And be the last one to blink
But can you forgive someone?

And if you do I'll run to you
Betray you with a word
I would slit my own throat first of all I will

The black peat of the hills
When I was still ill
See this mess and forgive someone
And then recall if you can
How all this even began
Forgive someone

And if you do I'll run to you
Betray you with a word
I would slit my own throat first of all I will

Our truth will die with me
Our truth will die with me

Shorts and supports and faulty shower heads
At track and field we dreamt of our beds
In the bleachers you sit with your legs spread, smiling
"Here's one thing you'll never have"

Our truth will die with me
Our truth will die with me
Our truth will die with me




 Found found found
Found found found
Someone who's worth it
In this murkiness
Someone who's never
Seeming scheming
Found found found
Found found found
Someone who's worth it
In this murkiness
Someone who's never
Seeming scheming

Oh, but if I'd never found
Oh, but if I'd never found
Oh, but if I'd never found

I do believe that
The more you give your love
And I do believe that
The more you offer trust
The more you chase
The more you cry
The more you're bound to lose
The more you're bound to lose
Oh, but if I'd never found
Oh, but if I'd never found
Somebody
Who wants to be
Who wants to be
With me
All the time




 Friday mourning, I'm dressed in black
Douse the house lights, I'm not coming back
For years, I warned you
Through tears, I told you
Friday mourning, there comes a time
Before that breaks this very smug mug of mine

This dawn raid soon put paid to
All the things I'd whispered to you
At night time
And I will never stand naked in front of you
Or if I do, it won't be for a long time
Look once to me, look once to me
Then look away
Look once to me, then look away
And when they haul me down the hall
And when they kick me down the stairs
I see the faces all lined up before me
Of teachers and of parents and bosses
Who all share a point of view
"You are a loser"
"You are a loser"
Friday, friday mourning
Dressed in black
I won't be coming back
(Friday...)




 Ganglord, the police are kicking their way into my house
And haunting me, taunting me, wanting me to break their laws
Ganglord, the police are kicking their way into my house
And haunting me, taunting me, wanting me to break their laws
And I'm turning to you to save me
And I'm turning to you to save me
Ganglord, the police are grinding me into the ground
The headless pack are back, small boy jokes and loaded guns
Ganglord, the police are grinding me into the ground
The headless pack are back, small boy jokes and loaded guns
And I'm turning to you to save me
And I'm turning to you to save me, save me
Save me, save me, to save me, save me
Oh to save me, save me, save me, save me
Gandlord, there's a clock on the wall making fun of us all
Ganglord, the clock on the wall and it makes a joke of us all
And I'm turning to you to save me and I'm turning to you
To save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, to save me
Ganglord, remember - the police can always be bribed
Ganglord, remember - the police can always be bribed
They say "to protect and to serve"
But what they really mean to say is:
"Get back to the ghetto, the ghetto
Get yourself back to the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
Get yourself back to the ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto"




 Oh, you silly old man
You silly old man
You're making a fool of yourself
So get off the stage
You silly old man
In your misguided trousers
With your mascara and your Fender guitar
And you think you can arouse us?
But the song that you just sang
It sounds exactly like the last one
And the next one
I bet you it will sound
Like this one
Downstage, and offstage
Don't you feel all run in?
And do you wonder when they will take it away?
This is your final fling
But then applause ran high
But for the patience of the ones behind you
As a verse drags on like a month drags on
It's very short, but it seems very long
And the song that you just sang
It sounds exactly like the last one
And the next one
I bet you it will sound
Like this one
So, get off the stage
Oh, get off the stage
And when we get down off of the stage
Please stay off the stage - ALL DAY!
Get off the stage
Oh, get off the stage
And when we've had our money back
Then I'd like your back in plaster
Oh, I know that you say
How age has no meaning
Oh, but here is your audience now
And they're screaming:
"Get off the stage"
Oh, get off the stage
Because I've given you enough of my time
And the money that wasn't even mine
Have you seen yourself recently?
Oh, get off the stage
Oh, get off the stage
For whom, oh...
For whom, oh...
For whom, oh...
For whom, oh...
Get off the stage
Get off the stage
Get off the stage
For whom the bell tolls




 How many times have I been around?
Recycled papers paving the ground
Well, she lives for the written word
And people come second, or possibly third
And there is no style, but I say, "well done"
To the girl least likely to
Oh, deep in my heart, how I wish I was wrong
But deep in my heart, I know I am not
And there's enough gloom in her world, I'm certain
Without my contribution
So I sit, and I smile, and I say "well done"
To the girl least likely to
Page after page of sniping rage
An English singe or an American tinge
"There's a publisher," she said, "...in the new year"
(It's never in this year)
I do think this, but I can't admit it
To the girl least likely to
So one more song with no technique
One more song which seems all wrong...
And oh, the news is bad again
See me as I am again
And the scales of justice sway one way
In the rooms of those least likely to
Oh, deep in my heart, how I want to be wrong
But the moods and the styles too frequently change
From 21 to 25, from 25 to 29
And I sit, and I smile, and I say "well done"
To the girl least likely to
Oh, one more song about The Queen
Or standing around the shops with thieves
"But somebody's got to make it!" she screams
"So why why can't it be me?"
But she would die if we heard her sing from the heart
Which is hurt
So how many times will I shed a tear?
And another stage of verse to cheer
When you shine in the public eye, my dear
Please remember these nights
When I sit and support with a dutiful smile
Because there's nothing I can say
So chucking, churning, and turning the knife
On everything (except their own life)
And a clock somewhere strikes midnight
And an explanation - it drains me
If only there could be a way
There is a different mood all over the world
A different youth, unfamiliar views
And dearest, it could all be for you
So will you come down and I'll meet you?
And with no more poems, with nothing to hear
Oh darling, it's all for you...
Darling, it's all for you...
Oh darling, it's all for you...
Oh darling, it's all for you...




 First day with the jar, you find
Everyone lies
First day with the jar, you find
Everyone lies, nobody minds
Everyone lies
Where is the man you respect?
And where is the woman you love?
Where's the woman you love?

Third week with the jar, you find
Everything dies
We won't vote Conservative
Because we never have
Everyone lies, everyone lies
Where is the man you respect?
And where is the woman you love?
Where's the woman you love?

Everything of worth
On Earth
Is there
To share

I used to dream, and I used to vow
I wouldn't dream of it now
We look to Los Angeles
For the language we use
London is dead, London is dead
London is dead, London is dead
London is dead, London is dead
Now I'm too much in love
I'm too much in love...

I know
I'll go
Empty hand
From the land




 I'm not running away
I'm running to
Corruption of the spirit isn't in it
For a good looking man about town
Are you afraid of someone alive?
Are you feeling heartbroken
Because you'll never be mistaken for a
Good looking man about town?
You got your degree
Then you flew to Mars
But you still feel wretched 'cause
You'll never be naked with a
Good looking man about town
Are you afraid of someone alive?
Are you scared to death
Of even looking at the flesh of a
Good looking man about town?
Hear the gang say
Marry me, marry me
On the midnight street
No moon and no stars
No one around to calm you down
And to soften the stings to my heart
The dream is sand in my hands
The dream becomes sand in my hands




 Here is London, giddy of London
Is it home of the free
Or what?
Can you squeeze me
Into an empty page of your diary
And psychologically save me
I've got faith in you
I sense the power
Within the fingers
Within an hour the power
Could totally destroy me
(Or, it could save my life)
Oh, here is London
"Home of the brash, outrageous and free"
You are repressed
But you're remarkably dressed
Is it real?
And you're always busy
Really busy
Busy, busy
Oh, hairdresser on fire
All around Sloane Square
And you're just so busy
Busy, busy
Busy scissors
Oh, hairdresser on fire
(Only the other day)
Was a client, over-cautious
He made you nervous
And when he said
"I'm gonna sue you"
Oh, I really felt for you
So can you squeeze me
Into an empty page of your diary
And supernaturally change me?
Change me, change
Oh, here in London
"Home of the brash, outrageous and free"
You are repressed
But you're remarkably dressed
Is it real?
And you're always busy
Really busy
Busy clippers
Oh, hairdresser on fire
All around Sloane Square
And you're just too busy
To see me
Busy clippers
Oh, hairdresser on fire
(Only the other day)




 Happy lovers, back together
Uh, and I do feel proud
Happy lovers, reunited
Uh, and I do feel proud now
I'm not the type to boost as you know
Thou it was me who brought them back together

He is so kind, and she is so clever
But they don't want me now
Hanging around
Happy lovers, at last, at last, united
Happy lovers at last, united

I rang to her to explain of how
He really wants to see you again
I said more or less the same thing to
Him too, which wasn't true
And now they walk, hand in hand
All is planned, with the silent glance
I believe that only lovers share
And I'm proud to have done
Something good for once

'Cause she is so kind, and he's so clever
But they don't need me now
Hanging around
Happy lovers, at last, at last united
Happy lovers, at last united
Oh, happy lovers, at last united
Oh, happy lovers, at last, at last, at last united




 Have a go
When the pubs all close
And have a go when they open
Then have a go by the traffic lights
Cut up or shut up, you're alright !
And as always I'm here right behind you
And as always there's time, so have another go
Oh ...
A small baby girl cradled in your arms
Your one big contribution
We'll never know
We'll never know
We'll never know
We'll never know
Ah, yes
Ah, yes
Oh ...
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Ah, ah, ha ha
A small girl runs crying, through the park
So freely her daddy berates her
Right now, so for the rest of her life
She is convinced that her daddy hates her
Oh ...
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Oh, oh, ha ha
Oh ...
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Oh, oh, ha ha
Oh ...
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Oh, oh, ha ha
Oh ...
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Oh, oh, ha ha
Oh ...
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Oh, oh, ha ha
Oh ...
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Oh, oh, ha ha




 I need you
Simple words
But words which had never been heard
By the soul
Stoned to death
But still living

And so he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried

Ride our minds
If you must
But there's always a line you don't cross
Time is short
Don't be cruel
Oh, you don't know the power
In what you're saying
Oh, ohoh

And so he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried

People where
I come from
They survive without feelings or blood
I never could
Was stoned to death
But I'm still living

So he froze where he stood
And he looked to the ground
And he cried
He cried

So he froze
And he looked, and he looked
To the ground
And he cried
He cried




 I came back to my old city
With fierce determination
And I couldn't find my way out of the station
It's all changed
You were there
Departing, starting
A trek I had once took
With that "no-one's gonna stop me when I feel this way" look

Apparent, apparent
Heir apparent
You think it's so easy, I tell you - it isn't
But you may change minds with your winning smile

I fell down in my old city
Such sad degradation
So I tried to make my way back to the station
You were still there
Gleaming and leaving
Wide-eyed and awestruck
Saying, "How can anybody hate me
If I love them first off?"

Apparent, apparent
Heir apparent
You think it's so easy, I tell you - it isn't
But you may change minds with your winning smile
Heir, heir, heir
Heir, heir, heir
Heir, heir, heir
Heir, heir, heir
But you may be OK, I don't know

I'll see you back here
In a few bruised years
Pray
I'll see you here
I'll see you here
I'll see you here

Apparent, apparent
Heir apparent
You say that you want it, I'm sure that you'll get it
They'll seduce your heart and then they'll slap your arse
Heir, heir, heir
Heir, heir, heir
Heir, heir, heir
Heir, heir, heir




 He knows, he knows
Or, I think he does
'Cause when I lived
In the arse of the world
He knows, he knows
He knows I'd love
To see him happy
(Or as close as is allowed)
Oh, 'cause when I lived
In the arse of the world ...
He knows, he knows
He knows I'd love
To see him happy
(Or as close as possible)
As close as possible
As close as possible
As close as is allowed
Oh, my name still conjures up deadly deeds
And a bad taste in the mouth
And the police - they actually know me
They said:
"You're just another person in the world
You're just another fool with radical views
You're just another who has maddening views
You want to turn it on its head
By staying in bed!"
I said: "I know I do"
He doesn't know ...




 A bond of trust
Has been abused
Something of value
May be lost
Give up your job
Squander your cash - be rash
Just hold on to your friends
There are more than enough
To fight and oppose
Why waste good time
Fighting the people you like
Who would fall defending your name
Don't feel so ashamed
To have friends
But now you only call me
When you're feeling depressed
When you feel happy I'm
So far from your mind
My patience is stretched
My loyalty vexed
You're losing all of your friends

Hold on to your friends
Hold on to your friends
Resist - or move on
Be mad, be rash
Smoke and explode
Sell all of your clothes
Just bear in mind:
There just might come a time
When you need some friends




 I have seen many shores
I hug the land but nothing more
Because I haven't met you
I have wined and I have dined
With everybody bogus music mogul
No sign of you
I have brushed and I have rubbed
Pressing palms; exuding charms
But never in arms

And that's why home is a question mark
Home is some  place I dunno
Home is a question mark
Home is some place I dunno

I have been brave
Deep in every shaven cave
None were you
Another film on replay
This time, Hell with Guillaume Canet
For wingless me

And that's why home is a question mark
Home is some place I dunno
Home is a question mark
Home is some place I dunno


Home, is it just a word?
Or is it something you carry within you?
I'm happy just to be here
If I ever find home
If I ever find home
If I ever find home
If I ever find home

If I get there, would you meet me?
Wrap your legs around my face
Just to greet me
If I ever get there, would you meet me?
Wrap your legs around my face
Just to greet me
If I ever get there
Do you really think I will?
Do you really think I will?
Do you really think I will?
How many times I've saved myself




 The future is around me
I'm not gonna cry for the things that never occurred
So do not remind me
Happy to be as I was in the first place

Honey, you know where to find me
Honey, you know where to find me
Kicking away from the mundane everyday
La la la la la la

The envy is beyond me
I'm not gonna pine for the things that can never be mine
Do not expect me to
I'm happy to be who I was in the first place

Honey, you know where to find me
Honey, you know where to find me
Kicking away from the mundane everyday
La la la la la-ah

The future is around me
I see it, I seize it, I use it, I throw it away
Because I'm happy to be like I was in the first place

Honey, you know where to find me
Honey, you know where to find me
Running away from the mundane
La la la la la-ah

Oh honey, you know where to find me
Honey, you know where to find me
Honey, you'll find how to know me
Oh, la la la la la-ah

Oh honey, you know how the land lies
La la la la la la la la la




 She told me she loved me
Which means
She must be insane
I've had my face dragged in
Fifteen miles of shit
And I do not, and I do not
And I do not like it
So how can anybody say
They know how I feel
The only one around here who is me
Is me

They said they respect me
Which means
Their judgement is crazy
I've had my face dragged in
Fifteen miles of shit
And I do not, and I do not
And I do not like it
So how can anybody say
They know how I feel
When they are they
And only I am I

He said he wants to befriend me
Which means
He can't possibly know me
The voices of the real
And the imagined cry:
"The future is passing you by
The future is passing you by"
So how can anybody possibly think they know how I feel?
Everybody look, see pain and walk away
And as for you in your uniform
Your smelly uniform
You think you can be rude to me
Because you wear a uniform
A smelly uniform
And so you think you can be rude to me
But even I, as sick as I am, I would never be you
Even I, as sick as I am, I would never be you
Even I, sick and depraved, a traveller to the grave
I would never be you
I would never be you




 I am the son
And the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Of nothing in particular
You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way?
I am Human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
I am the son
And the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir
Oh, of nothing in particular
You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way ?
I am Human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
There's a club, if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go, and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home, and you cry
And you want to die
When you say it's gonna happen "now"
Well, when exactly do you mean?
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone
You shut your mouth
How can you say
I go about things the wrong way ?
I am Human and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does




 Uno due tre
Well, if you don't like it
Go ahead, find yourself a saint
Go ahead now, try to find a boy
Who's gonna be all the things I ain't
What you need is a plastic doll
With a fresh coat of paint
Who's gonna sit through the madness
And always act so quaint
Oh yeah yeah yeah
With your new friends
You're really making a scene
I've seen you bouncing around
From machine to machine
And you know
They're never real
They're never what they seem
And you can try to generate some warmth
And you see just what I mean
Oh yeah yeah yeah
And if I'm acting like a king
Well, that's 'cause I'm a human being
I want too many things
And that's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
I said well, I'm a human being
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah
I'm a human being
And I just go around with my head hung down
Just like a human being and all those human beings
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, I'm a riffraff human being
Won't you give me a little sip
Why don't you try me on a drag of that cigarette
Why don't you try to give me something that
I'll never ever forget
But now don't you blow it all
On a million dollar bet
Because you're liable to lose it
On the best lovin' you've had yet
Oh yeah yeah yeah
And if I'm acting like a king
Well that's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
That's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
I said well, I'm a human being
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah
I'm a human being
And I just go around with my head hung down
Just like a human being and all those human beings
I can hold my head so high
Just like a human, I'm a riff raff human being
In fact I'm talking about the human race
Trying to cover up the big disgrace
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Well I may think that this whole scene
Is too appalling for me
Or I may be the type who is just a mad about
Everything that I see
But I can't cover this with history
Or make it just what I want it to be
I'm blowing my change on the fan magazines
With all the Hollywood refugees
Said yeah yeah, oh yeah
And If I'm acting like a king
That's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I want too many things
That's 'cause I'm a human being
And if I've got to dream
I said well, I'm a human being
And if it gets to be obscene, yeah
I'm a human being




 I am hated for loving
I am hated for loving
Anonymous call, a poison pen
A brick in the small of the back again
I still don't belong
To anyone - I am mine

And I am hated for loving
I am haunted for wanting
Anonymous call, a poison pen
A brick in the... ah
A brick in the small of the back again
I still don't belong
To anyone - I am mine

I am falling
With no-one to catch me
I am falling
And there's still
No-one to catch me
Aha, aha, aha, ahh

Anonymous call, a poison pen
A brick in the... ah
A brick in the small of the back again
I just don't belong
To anywhere
I just don't belong




 I love you - it's murder
I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to
I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to
I love you - it's pointless
In my soul
If I live or die
This night
I am two people
One you know but don't like
The other one you don't know, but you don't want to
I have two faces
One of which you know
The other one for your sake I never will show
It's just because I love you
I cannot bear to be around you
And if only one or the other
Of us would
Drop
Down
Dead




 A wretched outcast
With no point of view
What could I do?
Just military service
I carry out the powerful vulgarian view
I scatter gloom
Do as I say or I'll scatter you
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
You can't blame me
I'm just an innocent soldier
There would be no war
If not for me
I'm just a sweet little soldier
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You can't blame me
I'm just an innocent soldier
Give me an order!
I'll blow up a border
Give me an order
And I'll blow up your daughter

Call me brave, call me a peace-making hero
Call me anything except what I am
From a class without, I haven't a clue
What the war is about
I haven't got a clue
Have you?
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You can't blame me
I'm just an innocent soldier
There would be no war
If not for me
I'm just a sweet little soldier
No, no, no, no, no
You can't blame me
After all, I'm just honour-mad, cannon fodder, honour-mad, cannon fodder
I'm honour-mad, cannon fodder
I'm honour-mad, cannon fodder
I'm honour-mad, cannon fodder
I'm honour-mad, cannon fodder
I'm honour-mad, cannon fodder, honour-mad, cannon fodder, honour-mad, cannon fodder

Duty done by
The moment at hand
I am answerable
Only to Jesus
And with the grace of God
I will die in my own bed
If you wonder what's in my head
It's just the hatred for all human life
When I lose mine, my mother will say:
"He died doing the job he loved"
But I died with a bullet to the forehead
That wasn't the job I loved
That wasn't the job I loved
That wasn't the job I loved

Funny how the war goes on
Without our John
Without our John
It's funny how the war goes on
Without our John

La la la la la la la
Funny how the war goes on

It's funny how the war goes on

 Staring in the window of the shop that never opens
Planning my selection from all the treats inside
Should I take as I desire - oh shall I, oh shall I?
Or should I hang around to be enticed inside?

I'm trying to explain to myself
I can have both
I'm trying to explain to the voice inside
I can have both
I can have both
There's nobody around to say no
Who've brain-washed the small shy boy inside
He doesn't know he can have both

Smiling through the window to the one who never serves you
I've not been feeling myself tonight
Should I take as I feel like it - well shall I, oh shall I?
Or should I wait and hope to be dragged inside?
Oh

I'm trying to explain to myself
I can have both
I'm trying to explain to the voice inside
I can have both
I can have both
There's nobody around to say no
Who've brain-washed the small shy boy inside
He doesn't know he can have both

I can have both
There's no need to choose
Because
I can have both
There's no need to choose
I can have both
There's no need to choose
Because
I can have both
There's no need to choose
I can have both
There's no need to choose




 Again
I lay awake
And I cried because of waste
I'd love to
(But only with you
Only with you)
Oh, time is gonna wipe us out
There, I've said it loud and clear
So that you will hear
There's no one in view
Just you
Just you
And time will never wipe you out
Now I've had enough
I've had more than could be
My rightful share
Of nights I can't bear
How can it be fair?
Time must wipe them out
So, again, I lay awake
In a trance
Oh, I just want my chance
But only with you
Only with you
That's all
That's all




 I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
Having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
So now you send me your hardened regards
When once you'd send me love
Sincerely I must tell you
Your mild best wishes
They make me suspicious

I don't mind
I don't mind if you forget me
Having learned my lesson
I never left an impression on anyone
The pressure to change, to move on
Was strange and very strong
So this is why I tell you
I really do understand
Bye bye
I don't mind if you forget me
No no no no no no no
You can only be strong for so long
It may not eat you but it will beat you
So this is why I tell you
I really don't understand
This time
Rejection is one thing
But rejection from a fool
Is cruel
Rejection is one thing
But rejection from a fool
Is cruel
And I don't mind if you forget me
I don't mind if you forget me




 Run, run young man through the glen
Run, young woman through the glen
See if I care, see if I care, see if I care
See if I care, See if I care, See if I care
If you don't like me, then don't look at me
There must be somebody else who can take your gaze aways
If you don't like me, then don't look at me
There must be somebody else who can take your gaze aways
Run, run young man through the glen
Run, young woman through the glen
And see if I care, see if I care, see If I care
See if I care, see if I care, see if I care
If you don't like me, then don't look at me
There must be somebody else who can take your gaze aways
If you don't like me, then don't look at me
There must be somebody else who can take your gaze aways
Aways, aways, aways, aways
If you don't want me
You don't have to have me
I just thought you might feel the same, that's all
If you don't want me
You don't have to have me
I just thought you might feel the same, that's all
That's all, that's all, that's all...




 I was a good kid
I wouldn't do you no harm
I was a nice kid
With a nice paper round
Forgive me any pain
I may have brung to you
With God's help I know
I'll always be near to you
But Jesus hurt me
When he deserted me, but

I have forgiven Jesus
For all the desire
He placed in me when there's nothing I can do
With this desire

I was a good kid
Through hail and snow I'd go
Just to moon you
I carried my heart in my hand
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
But Jesus hurt me
When he deserted me, but

I have forgiven Jesus
For all of the love
He placed in me
When there's no-one I can turn to with this love
Monday - humiliation
Tuesday - suffocation
Wednesday - condescension
Thursday - is pathetic
By Friday life has killed me
By Friday life has killed me
Oh pretty one
Oh pretty one
Why did you give me
So much desire?
When there is nowhere I can go
To offload this desire
And why did you give me
So much love
In a loveless world
When there's no one I can turn to
To unlock all this love
And why did you stick me in
Self-deprecating bones and skin
Jesus -
Do you hate me?
Why did you stick me in
Self-deprecating bones and skin
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?
Do you hate me?




 Lord, these words I beg of you
As I kneel down at my bed
Because soon I will be dead
Let's face it soon I will be dead
And I just want to
I want to see the boy happy
With some hope in his pale eyes
Is that too much to ask?
Before I die
I have one final dream
For my own life I don't care anything

Lord these words I beg of you
As I kneel down at my bed
Let's face it soon I will be dead
And I just want to
I want to see the boy happy
With his arms around his first love
Is that too much to ask?
Before I die
I have one final dream
For my own life I don't care anything
And I just want to
I want to see this boy happy
Why is this such a bad thing?




 So what do you think I am?
And how precisely could you tell
A decent skin is all I am?
People think badly of me
But one day maybe they'll praise
Oh but meanwhile...
I knew I was next
And I didn't mind
Here I offer you my life for any debts you're due
And when you've been down for the very last time
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you
The shadows of trees, they reach to me
They know a decent skin is all I am
People think badly of me
But when I'm in grave maybe they'll praise
Oh but meanwhile...
I knew I was next
And I didn't mind
Here I offer you my life for any debts you're due
And when you've been down for the very last time
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you
Oh but meanwhile...
I knew I was next
And I didn't mind
When you've been slapped around
And one more slap can't hurt you
And when you've been down for the very last time
There is nothing anyone can do to hurt you
I knew I was next
And I didn't mind
When you've been slapped around
And one more slap can't hurt you
And when you've been down for the very last time
There is nothing anyone can say to hurt you




 My love, wherever you are
Whatever you are
Don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Please wait
Oh, wait
Don't lose faith
You say that the day
Just never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
Still I know it's gonna happen someday
To you
Please wait
Don't lose faith




 A child in a curious phase
A man with sullen ways
Oh, I know very well how I got my name
You think you were my first love
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong
You were the only one
Who's come and gone
When thirteen years old
Who dyed his hair gold?
Oh, I know very well, I don't need to be told
You think you were my first love
You think you were my first love, but you're wrong
You were the only one
Who's come and gone
You were the only one
Who's come and gone

 Something in you caused me to
Take a new tack with you
You were going through something
I had just about scraped through
Why do you think I let you get away
With the things you say to me?
Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you

No one I ever knew
Or have spoken to resembles you
This is good or bad
All depending on my general mood
Why do you think I let you get away
With all the things you say to me?
Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you

Magistrates who spend their lives
Hiding their mistakes
They look at you and I
And envy makes them cry
Envy makes them cry
Forces of containment
They shove their fat faces into mine
You and I just smile
Because we're thinking the same line
Why do you think I let you get away
With all the things you say to me?
Could it be I like you?
It's so shameful of me - I like you
You're not right in the head
And nor am I, and this is why
You're not right in the head
And nor am I, and this is why
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you
Because you're not right in the head
And nor am I, and this is why
You're not right in the head
And nor am I, and this is why
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you...




 Warm lights from the grand houses blind me
Haves cannot stand have-nots
And my love is under the ground
My one true love is under the ground

And I'll never be, I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's hero now
I'll never be, I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's hero now

They who should love me walk right through me
I am a ghost and as far as I know I haven't even died
And my love is under the ground
My one true love is under the ground

And I'll never be, I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's hero now
I'll never be, I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's hero now
See me as I am
See me as I am
See me as I am

I'll never be, I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's lover now
I'll never be, I'll never be
I'll never be anybody's lover now

Things I've heard and I've seen and I've felt and I've been
Tell me I'll never be anybody's lover now
It begins in the heart and it hurts when it's true
It only hurts because it's true




 I'm driving
Your girlfriend home
And she's saying
How she never chose you
"turn left", she says
So I turn left
And she says
"So how did I end up
So deeply involved in
The very existence
I planned on avoiding?"
And I can't answer
I'm driving
Your girlfriend home
And she's laughing
To stop herself crying
"drive on", she says
So I drive on
And she says
"So how did I end up
Attached to this person
When his sense of humour
Gets gradually worser?"
And I can't tell her
I'm parking
Outside her home
And we're shaking hands
Goodnight, so politely




 Don Juan, picaresque
Wife-beater vest
Cold hand, ice man
Warring caveman
Well if this is what it takes to describe
I'm not a man

Wheeler, dealer
Mover, shaker
Casanova
Beefaroni, but lonely
Well if this what it takes to describe
I'm not a man, I'm not a man
I'm something much bigger and better than
A man

Wise-ass, smart-ass
Workaholic
Thick-skinned, two-fisted hombre, ole
Well if these are terms you'd use to describe

Oh I'm shaking, look at me
I'm quaking, true grit, true blue
Kill crazy, so very manly of you
You are the soldier
Who won't get much older
You are the slow Joe
Who signed up to go

Wolf down, wolf down
T-bone steak
Wolf down
Cancer of the prostate
Ways to sit and of course
Ways to stand
I'm not a man, I'm not a man

No, big fat locker room, hockey-jock, laughing
I'm not a man
I'd never kill or eat an animal
And I never would destroy this planet I'm on
Well what do you think I am?
A man?




 On returning
I can't believe this world is still turning
The pressure's on
Because the pleasure hasn't gone
And I'm
Not sorry for
For the things I've done
And I'm
Not looking for
Just anyone

On competing
Oh, when will this tired heart stop beating?
It's all a game
Existence is only a game
And I'm
Not sorry for
For the things I've done
And I'm
Not looking for
Just anyone

I'm
Slipping below the water line
I'm
Slipping below the water line
Reach for my hand
And, and the race is won
Reject my hand
And the damage is done
I'm
Slipping below the water line
I'm
Slipping below the water line
The woman of my dreams
She, she never came along
The woman of my
Dreams
Well, there never was one
And I'm
Not sorry for
For the things I've said
There's a wild man in my head
There's a wild man
In my head




 Could this be an arm around my waist?
Well, surely the hand contains a knife?
It's been so all of my life
Why change now?
"It hasn't!"

Now this might surprise you, but
I find I'm ok by myself
And I don't need you
Or your morality to save me
No, no, no, no, no

Then came an arm around my shoulder
Well surely the hand holds a revolver?
It's been so all of my life
Why change now?
"It hasn't!"

Now this might disturb you, but
I find I'm ok by myself
And I don't need you
Or your benevolence to make sense
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!

After all these years
I find I'm ok by myself
And I don't need you
Or your homespun philosophy
No, no, no, no

This might make you throw up in your bed:
I'm OK by myself
And I don't need you
And I never have, I never have
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!
Noooooooo!




 With no complications
Fifteen generations
(of mine)
All honouring nature
Until I arrive
(with incredible style)
I'm the end of the line
The end of the family line
The end of the line
No baby pulled screaming
Out into this seething whirl
By chance or whim
(or even love ? )
Our family tree hacked into decline
And I'm spared the pain
Of ever saying
("goodbye")
I'm the end of the line
The end of the family line
The end of the line
The decision is mine
The end of the family line
The end of the line
I'm the end of the line
The end of the family line
The end of the ...




 In the absence of your love
And in the absence of human touch
I have decided

I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because
Only stone and steel accept my love

In the absence of your smiling face
I travel all over the place
And I have decided

I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because
Only stone and steel accept my love

I'm throwing my arms around
Around Paris because
Only stone and steel
Accept my love

I'm throwing my arms around
Paris because nobody wants my love
Nobody wants my love
Nobody needs my love
Nobody wants my love
Yes you made yourself plain
Yes you made yourself very plain




 There are some bad people on the right
There are some bad people on the right
They're saving their own skins by
Ruining people's lives
Bad, bad people on the right

 Time is like a dream
And now for a time you are mine
Let's hold fast to the dream
That tastes and sparkles like wine
Who knows if it's real
Or just something we're both dreaming of
What seems like an interlude now
Could be the beginning of love
Loving you is a world that's strange
So much more than my heart can hold
Loving you makes the whole world change
Loving you I could not grow old
No, nobody knows when love will end
So till then, sweet friend

 Armed with wealth and good health
The best of health
In the future when all's well
I will lie down and be counted
In the future when all's well

I thank you
I thank you with all of my heart
I thank you
I thank you with all of my heart
Please, please stand up and defend me
In the future when all's well
Confront what you are afraid of
In the future when all's well

Every day I play a sad game called
In the future when all's well
Living longer than I had intended
Something must have gone right

I thank you
I thank you with all of my heart
I thank you
I thank you with all of my heart
Please, please stand up and defend me
In the future when all's well
Confront what you are afraid of
In the future when all's well

Hold me closely if your will allows it
In the future when all's well
Paired-off
Pawed till I can barely stand it
The future is ended by a long, long sleep
The future is ended by a long, long sleep
The future is ended by a long sleep




 The Arab Spring called us all
The people win when the dictators fall
I heard a bang and an almighty crack
And I just want my face in your lap
The people sing when the warlords all burn
Do not feel sad, it's simply their turn
They tried to wipe us clean off the map
And I just want my face in your lap
I just want my face in your lap

I rescued you in so many ways
You're good for a laugh, that's all you can say
Summer is winter and winter prevails
And I'm so tired of counting the days
I'm so tired of counting the days

The security force is always the worst
Government advised, they're spraying our eyes
They live to kill and they love just to harm
And I'm dreaming of touching your arm




 Irish blood, English heart, this I'm made of
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
And no regime can buy or sell me

I've been dreaming of a time when
To be English is not to be baneful
To be standing by the flag not feeling shameful
Racist or partial

Irish blood, English heart, this I'm made of
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of
And I will die with both of my hands untied

I've been dreaming of a time when
The English are sick to death of Labour and Tories
And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell
And denounce this royal line
That still salute him and will salute him forever




 You realize, if you're happy
Jesus send you straight to hell
Israel
Israel
And should you dare enjoy your body
Here tolls Hades' welcome bell
Israel
Israel
You've found a middle-course existence
We're all bones and flesh and shell
Israel
Israel
I can't answer for what armies do
They are not you
They are not you
They are not you
In other climes, they bitch and whine
Just because you're not like them
Israel
Israel
The sky is dark for many others
They want it dark for you as well
Israel
Israel
Earth is just one big asylum
And explodes a prison cell
See us squirm
In our own damaged spell
You were born as guilty sinners
Before you stood upright you fell
Put the fear of many gods
In Israel
Nature gave you every impulse
Who are virgin priests to tell
Who/how to love
How to live
Israel
And they who reign abuse upon you
They are jealous of you as well
Love yourself as you should
Israel




 When he first cried, his mother died
I had tried to be his guide
When he was born I was too young
The father searches for the son
In Istanbul
Give him back to me, oh Istanbul
Give me back my brown eyed son
Moonlight jumping through the trees
Sunken eyes avoiding me
From dawn to dusk, the hunt is on
The father searches for the son
In Istanbul
Give him back to me, in Istanbul
Give me back my brown eyed son
On secret streets in disbelief
Little shadow shows the lead
Prostitutes stylish and glum
In amongst them, you are one
Oh what have I done
Rolling breathless off the tongue
The viscious street gang slang
I lean into a box of pine
Identify the kid as mine




 I can kill standing still
It's easy
I can scare with a stare
It's easy

Hey Ringo, it's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall
When you're small
Whether dressed in disciplined style
Nevermind
When you're small
You walk as if you're falling

I attack from the back
Because it's easy
And I can assail
While wearing very nice jewellery

Oh hey Ringo, it's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall
When you're small
Whether dressed in disciplined style
Nevermind
When you're small
You spend your life crawling
I burst into public bars
And I throw my weight around
And no one can even see me
No one can even see me
Nobody can see me
No one can see me
Success is just a mess, Oh

Hey gringo, it's sad though
Because it's hard to walk tall
When you're small
Whether dressed in disciplined style
Nevermind
When you're small
You're bound to look appalling
So compadre please do this for me
Compadre please weep for me
Compadre, compadre
Please weep for me




 Your voice it might say 'no'
But the heart has a will of its own
Your voice it might say 'no'
But the heart has a heart of its own, own

It's not your birthday anymore
There's no need to be kind to you
And the will to see you smile and belong
Has now gone
It's not your birthday anymore
Did you really think we meant
All of those syrupy, sentimental things
That we said?

It cannot be given
And so it must be taken
It cannot be given
And so it must be taken

All of the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way
To the love I am now giving to you
Right here, right now on the floor
All of the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way
To the love I am now giving to you
Right here, right now on the floor

It's not your birthday anymore
There's no need to be kind to you
And the will to see you smile and belong
Has now gone
It's not your birthday anymore
Did you really think we meant
All of those syrupy, sentimental things
That we said yesterday?




 I'm standing in the dock
With my innocent hand on my heart
I've changed my plea
I've changed my plea to guilty
Because freedom is wasted on me
See how your rules spoil the game?
Outside there is a pain
Emotional air raids exhausted my heart
And it's safer to be inside
So, I'm changing my plea
And no one can dissuade me
Because freedom is wasted on me
See how your rules spoil the game?
Something I have learned
If there is one thing in life I've observed
It's that everybody's got somebody
Oh no, not me
So I've changed my plea to guilty
And reason and freedom is a waste
It's a lot like life




 Nobody knows what human life is
Why we come, why we go
So why then do I know
I will see you
I will see you in far off places

The heart knows why I grieve
And yes one day I will close my eyes forever
But I will see you
I will see you in far off places

It's so easy for us to sit together
But it's so hard for our hearts to combine
And why?
And why?
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

Destiny for some is to save lives
But destiny for some is to end lives
But there is no end
And I will see you in far off places

If your god bestows protection upon you
And if the USA doesn't bomb you
I believe I will see you somewhere safe
Looking to the camera, messing around
And pulling faces




 I wish you lonely
If only for one day
So that you might see routine for me
Since the day I was born, born
Think of yourself only
Of everything you demand
You want and you need
And to hell
To hell with everybody else, everybody else

Turn the key slowly
Remember how I can't sleep
Or if ever I do, an earthquake
An earthquake couldn't agitate, couldn't agitate

Tombs full of fools who gave their life upon command
Of monarchy, oligarch, head of state, potentate
And now never coming back, never coming back
Tombs are full of fools who gave their life upon command of Romance gone wrong
The same old glue
And never coming true, never coming true
Tombs are full of fools who gave their life upon command of
Heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin
And never coming back, never coming back
I wish you lonely
Like the last tracked humpback whale
Chased by gunships from Bergen
But never giving in, never giving in




 Oh, you look so tired
Mouth slack and wide
Ill-housed and ill-advised
Your face is as mean
As your life has been
Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you
And I know a place
Where no-one is likely to pass
Oh, you don't care if it's late
And you don't care if you're lost
And oh, you look so tired
But tonight you've presumed too much
Too much, too much
And if it's the last thing I ever do
I'm gonna get you
Crash into my arms
I want you
You don't agree
But you don't refuse
I know you
And no one knows a thing about my life
I can come and go as I please
If I want to I can stay
Or if I want to I can leave
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Nobody knows me, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me
Aah, aah, nobody knows me




 Jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
I make this claim, now let me explain
Since she lost you
Jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
Free in the truth of make-believe
Since she lost you

She is determined to prove
How she can build up the pain
Of every lost and lonely day

Jacky's only happy when she's up on the stage
She'll make you believe what you'll never believe
Since she lost you
Jacky's only Jacky when she's up on the stage
Living bodies that actually move!
Since she lost you

She is determined to prove
How she can fill up the page
Of every lost and lonely day

"Cue lights! I am singing to my lover at night!
Scene Two: Everyone who comes must go!
Scene Four: Blacker than ever before!
Scene Six: This country is making me sick!"

Jacky cracks when she isn't on stage
See the effects of sexual neglect
No script, no crew, no auto-cue
No audience telling her what to do!
Exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's running to the exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit
Everybody's heading for the exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit, exit




 Journalists who lie
Stealing the money
Prospering with spite
Hate-in-a-hurry
See how they're only trying to make their name
By spreading biz-myth-lies
About the ones who've made their name
Stick in the knife
Stick in the knife
Journalists who lie
The truth is, it happens
Praise then crucify
Just follow this pattern
And see how they're only trying to make their name
By spreading sickening lies
About the ones who've made their name
Give us the knife!
Give us the knife!
Journalists who lie
So happy in malice
For a Rock-Star out of line
So happy in malice
Journalists who lie
So sick and belaboured
They only want to be favored
They only want to be favored
See how they're only trying to make their name
With unprovable lies
About the ones who've made their name
In the black hole of your soul
Still bargaining away the truth so easily




 Julie lie down in the weeds and see something new
Something new
Julie from now on all the pain of youth
It will not trouble you
It will not trouble you

North, east, south, west
No one has a clue
Nobody quite knows what to do

Julie lie down in the weeds and see
How I look at you
How I look at you

North, east, south, west
No one has a clue
Nobody quite knows what to do

There are some people
Who live in order to tell others what to do
Tell others what to do
As long as there remains steel in my veins
They will not trouble you
They will not touch you
Will not trouble you




 Kick the bride down the aisle
And make no mistake
It's the best you can do for everyone's sake

Kick the bride down the aisle
And treasure the day
I know so much more than I'm willing to say

She just wants a slave
To break his back in pursuit of a living wage
So that she can laze and graze
For the rest of her days
Write down every word I say

Kick the bride down the aisle
In a mudslide of gloom
She'll order you to tidy your room

Kick the bride down the aisle
Look at that cow in the field
It knows more than your bride knows now

She just wants a slave
To break his back in pursuit of a living wage
So that she can laze and graze
For the rest of her days
Write down every word I say

You're that stretch of the beach
That the tide doesn't reach
No meaning, no reason
The lonely season...

Kick the bride down the aisle
And treasure the day




 Your boyfriend, he
Went down on one knee
Well, could it be
He's only got one knee?
I tried to surprise you
With Vodka
Or, Tizer
I can't quite remember
But you didn't thank me
You didn't even thank me
Because you never do

Your boyfriend, he
Has the gift of the gab
Or, could it be
The gift of the grab?
I tried to surprise you
I lay down beside you
And nothing much happened
And you didn't phone me
You didn't even phone me
Because it's not your style
To dial

Your boyfriend, he
Displays to me
More than just
A hint of cruelty
I tried to surprise you
I crept up behind you
With a homeless chihuahua
You cooed for an hour
You handed him back and said
"You'll never guess
I'm bored now"




 Bastille mausoleum
Stockyard, churchyard
Your mammy's backyard
I don't care when or where
I just care that you're there
And that you will...
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over my face
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over the place
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over and then when you've kissed me
Kiss me all over again
Bastille mausoleum
Stockyard, churchyard
Your mammy's backyard
I don't care when or where
I only care that the two of us are there
And that you, and that you will...
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over my face
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over the place
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over and then when you've kissed me
Kiss me all over again
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
Kiss me all over my face
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
All over the place
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot
I don't care where or when but when you've kissed me
Kiss me all over again




 Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
So, tell me how long
Before the last one ?
And tell me how long
Before the right one ?
The story is old - I KNOW
But it goes on
The story is old - I KNOW
But it goes on
Oh, GOES ON
And on
Oh, goes on
And on




 Winter coming
Winter push on
(push on)
Oh, winter push on
Winter is so long
Winter moves on
The last night on Maudlin Street
Goodbye house
Goodbye stairs
I was born here
And I was raised here
And I took some sticky here
Love at first sight
May sound trite
But it's true, you know
I could list the details
Of everything you ever wore
Or said, or how you stood the day
And as we spend the last night
On Maudlin Street
"Goodbye house-forever!"
I never stole a happy hour
Around here
Where the world's ugliest boy
Became what you see
Here I am—the ugliest man
It's the last night on Maudlin Street
And truly I do love you
Oh, truly I do love you
When I sleep with that picture of
You framed beside my bed
Oh, it's childish and it's silly
But I think it's you in my room
By the bed
Yes, I told you it was silly
And I know I took strange pills
But I never meant to hurt you
Oh truly I love you
I came home late one night
Everyone had gone to bed
Nobody stays up for you
I had sixteen stitches
All around my head
The last bus I missed to Maudlin Street
So, he drove me home in the van
Complaining: "Women only like me for my mind..."
Don't leave your torch behind
A power cut ahead
1972, you know
And so we crept through the park
But no I cannot steal a pair of jeans
Off a clothesline for you
But you without clothes
Oh I could not keep a straight face
Me without clothes?
Well a nation turns its back and gags
I'm packed
I am moving house
A half-life disappears today
Every hag waves me on
Secretly wishing me gone
Well, I will be soon
Oh I will be soon
There were bad times on Maudlin Street
They took you away in a police car
Dear Inspector, don't you know?
Don't you care?
Don't you know about love?
Your gran died
And your mother died
On Maudlin Street
In pain and ashamed
With never time to say
Those special things
I took the keys from Maudlin Street
Well, it's only bricks and mortar!
And...truly I do love you
Wherever you are
Wherever you are




 There's a place in the sun
For anyone who has the will to chase one
And I think I've found mine
Yes, I do believe I have found mine, so

Close your eyes
And think of someone
You physically admire
And let me kiss you, ohh
Let me kiss you, ohh

I've zig-zagged all over America
And I cannot find a safety haven
Say, would you let me cry
On your shoulder
I've heard that you'll try anything twice

Close your eyes
And think of someone
You physically admire
And let me kiss you, ohh
Let me kiss you, ohh

But then you open your eyes
And you see someone
That you physically despise
But my heart is open
My heart is open to you




 I did not know Margaret on a personal level, but she was always there on the front row - the U.K., the U.S., Israel - wherever we'd go, she'd go. Last week Margaret drove behind the tour bus all the way from Davis to Seattle, and managed to get onstage at Davis. I had signed her arm and it was now a tattoo. This week she is dead.
I can only hope, for Margaret, that death yields the profit of rest, and somehow provides her with a listener. We all weary of living in the same skin day after day, in a world where only the blandly trivial are allowed to be heard, but there is nothing wrong with taking your destiny into your own hands, just as there is nothing wrong in understanding what is meant for you and what isn't. We are plonked into life without ever choosing to be, and we are despised if we fail to find a paralyzed spot in which to keep still and shut up. Margaret was a woman of action, who now knows the soul of the world.
Meanwhile, on today's AOL News Page, headlines tell us that Victoria Beckham has reportedly dropped her "fake" look, and William and Kate are in search of yet another home - the constitutional frigidity of a media world now openly obsessed with zombies and morons.
Rest well, Margaret.

 Let the right one in
Let the old dreams die
Let the wrong ones go
They cannot
They cannot
They cannot do what you want them to do
Oh ...
Let the right one in
Let the old dreams die
Let the wrong ones go
They do not
They do not
They do not see what you want them to
Oh ...
Let the right one in
Let the old things fade
Put the tricks and schemes (for good) away
Ah ... I will advise
Ah ... Until my mouth dries
Ah ... I will advise you to ...
Ah ... let the right one slip in
Slip in
Slip in
And when at last it does
I'd say you were within your rights to bite
The right one and say, "what kept you so long ?"
"What kept you so long ?"
Oh ...




 The work you chose has a practical vein
But I read much more into your name

Lifeguard
Patrolling the lenght and the breadth of your pool
I call your name from the vestibule
Lifeguard
Lifeguard - save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from the ails and the ills, and
From other things

The center of the town is a dangerous zone
Drenched in phlegm every time that I come home

Lifeguard - save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from the ails and the ills
And from other things
Love me, oh help me, oh
Oh help me, oh help oh
Lifeguard, guard me from life
Lifeguard, guard me from life

The last bus home is the dangerous one
A baseball bat across the collarbone

Lifeguard, lifeguard, save me from life
Save me from life
Save me from life
'Cause it's the only life I'll ever have
I'm always good, I'm never bad
And I've always been so kind
To the sick and to the partially blind
Save me from life




 Always looking for attention
Always needs to be mentioned
Who does she think she should be?
The shrill cry through darkening air
Doesn't she know he's had such a busy day?
Tell her, sshhh
Somebody tell her, sshhh
(Oh, no way, no way, no way, no way, there's no movement
Oh, oh, hooray
Slowest...)

It was only a test
But she swam too far against the tide
She deserves all she gets
The sky became mad with stars
As an out-stretched arm slowly disappears
Hooray, oh hooray!
(No, oh, oh, oh, there's no movement
No, oh hooray, oh hooray)
Please don't worry
There'll be no fuss
She was nobody's nothing
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)

When he awoke
The sea was calm
And another day passes like a dream
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)
(What's your name...?)




 It's the same old S.O.S
But with brand new broken fortunes
And once again I turn to you
Once again I do I turn to you
It's the same old S.O.S
But with brand new broken fortunes
I'm the same underneath
But this you, you surely knew

Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life, life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
And if you don't know this
Then what do you know?
Every second of my life I only live for you
And you can shoot me
And you can throw me off a train
I still maintain
I still maintain
Life, life is a pigsty
Life is a pigsty
And I'd been shifting gears all of my life
But I'm still the same underneath
This you surely knew
I can't reach you
I can't reach you
I can't reach you anymore

Can you please stop time?
Can you stop the pain?
I feel too cold
And now I feel too warm again
Can you stop this pain?
Can you stop this pain?
Even now in the final hour of my life
I'm falling in love again
Again
Even now in the final hour of my life
I'm falling in love again
Again
Again
Again
I'm falling in love again
Again
Again
Again




 An afternoon nostalgia
Television show
You spoke in silhouette
(But they couldn't name you)
Although the panel were
Very polite to you
Oh, but I remembered you
From Friday nights 1969
ATV - you murdered every line
Too old to be a child star
Too young to take leads
Four seasons passed
And they axed you
Nervously juvenile
(Won't smile!)
What became of you?
Did that swift eclipse torture you?
A star at eighteen
And then—suddenly gone
Down to a few lines
In the back page of a teenage annual
Oh but I remembered you
I remembered you




 Jet trails in the sky
Leave one word behind
A hand bangs into sand a name
And we all understand

Everybody's Lost
But they're pretending they're not
Lost
Oh, lost

Jet trails in the sky
Leave one thought behind
A hand bangs into sand a name
And we all understand

Everybody's Lost
But they're pretending they're not
Lost
Oh, lost

So if I see you
And I tell you
How I've watched you
I'm just lost
So if I see you
And I tell you
I've watched you
Don't make fun of me later
'Cause I'm just lost
If I see you
And I tell you
How I've watched you
Don't make fun of me later
'Cause I'm just lost
If I see you
And I tell you
How I've watched you
Don't make fun of me later
'Cause I'm just lost
(Lost lost lost lost lost lost)




 When your gift unfurls
When your Talent becomes apparent
I will roar from the stalls
I will gurgle from the circle
The Saints smile shyly
Down on you
Oh, they couldn't get over
Your nine-leaf clover
Oh, lucky lisp was not wasted on you
Lucky lisp wasn't wasted on you
When your name's with the best
Will my name be on your guest list?
And I will roar from the stalls
Ooh, the balcony fool was me, you fool
Jesus made this all for you, love (you, love)
He couldn't get over
Your Grandma's omen
Oh, lucky lisp was not wasted on you
Lucky lisp wasn't wasted on you




 On this glorious occasion...
Of the splendid defeat

I wanna start from before the beginning
Loot wine, be mine, and
Then let's stay out for the night
Ride via Parkside, semi-perilous lives
Jeer the lights in the windows
Of all safe and stable homes
But wondering then
Well what could peace of mind be like?
Anyway do you want to hear
Our story, or not?
As the Fulham Road lights
Stretch and invite into the night
From a Stevenage overspill
We'd kill to live around
SW6 - with someone like you
Keep thieves' hours
With someone like you
As long as it slides
You stalk the house
In a low-cut blouse:
"Oh Christ, another stifled Friday night!"
And the Fulham Road lights
Stretch and invite into the night
Well, I was fifteen
What could I know?
When the gulf between
All the things I need
And the things I receive
Is an ancient ocean wide, wild, lost, uncrossed
Still I maintain there's nothing wrong with you
You do all that you do
Because it's all you can do
Well, I was fifteen
Where could I go?
With a soul full of loathing
For stinging bureaucracy
Making it anything
Other than easy
For working girls like me
With my hands on my head
I flop on your bed
With a head full of dread
For all I've ever said
Maladjusted, maladjusted
Maladjusted, maladjusted
Never to be trusted
Oh, never to be trusted
There's nothing wrong with you, oh
There's nothing wrong with you, oh
There's nothing wrong with you, oh
There's nothing wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with you




 Mama, why did you do it?
Mama, who drove you to it?

Was it the pigs in grey suits
Persecuting you?
Uncivil servants
Unconcerned at how they frighten you

Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you

Mama, why did you do it?
Mama, who drove you to it?

Spare priggish money-men
Who scared the life out of you
Bailiffs with bad-breath
I will slit their throats for you

Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you, mama

Life is nothing much to lose
It's just so lonely here without you, so
We're gonna run to you
We're gonna come to you
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama
We're gonna be with you
We're gonna join you
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama
And we will be safe and sheltered in our graves
We'll come before you
And we will kiss you
By way for one final hug, Mama




 The kind people
Have a wonderful dream
Margaret on the guillotine
'Cause people like you
Make me feel so tired

When will you die?
When will you die?
When will you die?
When will you die?
When will you die?

And people like you
Make me feel so old inside
Please die
And kind people
Do not shelter this dream
Make it real
Make the dream real
Make the dream real
Make it real
Make the dream real
Make it real




 In Mexico
I went for a walk to inhale
The tranquil, cool, lover's air
But I could taste a trace
Of American chemical waste
And the small voice said
"What can we do?"
In Mexico
I went for a walk to inhale
The tranquil, cool, lover's air
But I could sense the hate
From the Lone Star state
And a small voice said
"What can we do?"
It seems if you're rich and you're white
You'll be alright
I just don't see why
This should be so
If you're rich and you're white
You'll be alright
I just don't see why
This should be so
In Mexico
I lay on the grass
And I cried my heart out
For want of my love
Oh, for want of my love
Oh, for want of my love
It seems if you're rich and you're white
You think you're so right
I just don't see why
This should be so
If you're rich and you're white
Then you'll be OK
I just don't see why
This should be so
In Mexico
I lay on the grass
And I cried my heart out
For want of my love
For want of my love
For want of my love
For want of my love




 Michael's bones
Lay where he fell
Face down on a sports ground
Oh...
He was just somebody's luckless son
Oh, but now look what he's done
Oh, look what he's done
Your gentle hands are frozen
And your unkissed lips are blue
Your thinning clothes are hopeless
And no one was mad about you
Michael's bones
Were very young
But they were never to know
Oh...
Impetuous fun
Mr. Policeman
I don't know where you get such notions from
His gentle hands are frozen
And his unkissed lips are blue
But his eyes still cry
And now you've turned the last bend
And see - are we all judged the same at the end?
Tell me, tell me
Oh, you lucky thing
You are too brave
And I'm ashamed of myself
As usual
Oh...




 Moonriver
Wider than a mile
I'll be crossing you in style
Someday
Oh, dreammaker
You heartbreaker
Wherever you're going
I'm going your way
Two drifters
Off to see the world
I'm not so sure the world
Deserves us
We're after
The same rainbow's end
How come it's just around the bend ?
It's always just around the bend ?

 The joy brings many things
It cannot bring you joy
Sons of mothers huddled here
Men and boys

1850 swung the doors
And human sewage swept inside
Where victims speak in whines
And where the hardened cried

I was sent here by a three-foot half-wit in a wig
I took his insults on the chin
And never did I flinch

A swagger hides the fear in here
By this rule we breathe
And there is no one on this earth
That I'd feel sad to leave

You see, we all lose
We all lose

What those in power do to you
Reminds us at a glance
How humans hate each others guts
And show it given the chance

We never say aloud the things
That we say in our prayers
'Cause no one cares

Many executed here
By the awful lawfully good
But the only thing that makes me cry
Is when I see the sky

Brenden Behan's laughter rings
For what he had or hadn't done
For he knew then, as I know know
That for each and every one of us..

We all lose
Rich or poor
We all lose
Rich or poor
We all lose




 We love them
We mourn for them
Unlucky boys of Red
I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where Mother Nature makes their bed
We miss them
Every night we kiss them
Their faces fixed in our heads
I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where Mother Nature makes their bed
They can't hurt you
Their style will never desert you
Because they're all safely dead
I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where Mother Nature makes their bed




 Your poor witness
Crying so loudly on the floor
Oh, well, she's only trying to tell you
What it was that she saw
She is only trying to tell you
What it was that she saw
Now see her standing on the table
With her small arms flailing
And you feel such compassion
In your soul for
Your mute witness
Still testing the strength
Of our patience
Oh, well she's only trying to tell you
What it was that she saw
She is only trying to tell you
What it was that she saw
Now see her pointing to the Frisbee
With a memory so fuzzy
And her silent words
Describing the sight of last night
4 A.M. Northside, Clapham Common
Oh, god, what was she doing there?
Will she sketch the answer later?
Well, I will ask her
"Now dry your tears, my dear"
Now see her mime in time so nicely
It would all have been so clear
If only she had never volunteered
"Your taxi is here, my dear"
La, la, la-la...




 These tears I'm wailing
I spill not without reason
Remove them my dearest love my
Take me, to the place I've been dreaming of
Where the grotesquely lonely meet the grotesquely lonely
And they whisper
Just very softly
Please be mine Dearest Love
Be my dearest love
Be my dearest love
I have hung on , hung on, hung on for one hundred years
For someone to shake me someone to wake me
If necessary someone to break me
My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love
My dearest love




 My life is an endless succession of people saying goodbye
My life is an endless succession of people saying goodbye
And what's left for me?
What's left for me?

At one time the future it stretched out before me
But now it stretches behind
And all of the best things in life are behind glass
Money, jewelry and flesh
And what's left for me?
What's left for me?




 Teach your kids to recognize and to despise all the propaganda
Filtered down by the dead echelons mainstream media

You know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society's hell
You need me just like I need you

Weren't we all born to mourn and to yawn at the occupations
That control every day of our lives
We can't live as we wish, live as we wish, live as we wish

You know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society's hell
You need me just like I need you
You know me well
My love, I'd do anything for you
Society's hell
You need me just like I need you

We all go our own ways
Separately in the same direction
And here am I every night of my life always missing someone
I'd like to be rotted out just before I become aware of the pain
The more I wish in my heart for someone less likely they come




 Aah...

 Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg's tears shampoo his beard
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg's lips tighten and thin
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg's hosed down in a barn
Neal Cassady drops dead
And Allen Ginsberg's howl becomes a growl

Everyone has babies
Babies full of rabies
Rabies full of scabies
Scarlet has a fever
Ring is full of ringworm
Angel of disdain
Poor little fella has rubella
Nipper full of fungus
Junior full of gangrene
Mine is melanoma
Tykes full of grippe
Whippersnapper's scurvy
Urchin made of acne

Get that thing away from me
Victim, or life’s adventurer
Which of the two are you?
Victim or life’s adventurer
Which of the two are you?




 Reflecting from my deathbed
I'm balancing life's riches against the ditches
And the flat gray years in between
All I can see are the never-laid
That's the never-played symphonies

I can't see those who tried to love me
All those who felt they understood me
And I can't see those who very patiently put up with me
All I can see are the never-laid
Or the never-played symphonies
You were one, you meant to be one
And you jumped into my face and laughed
And kissed me on the cheek and then were gone forever
...not quite
Black sky in the daytime
And I don't much mind dying
When there is nothing left to care for anymore
Just the never-laid, the never-played symphonies
You were one, you knew you were one
And you slipped right thru my fingers
No not literally but metaphorically
And now you're all I see as the light fades




 Nine times fined
Never mind
Things can only improve
We are just stood here
Waiting for the next great wound
And we just can't wait to make more mistakes
And to fluff our breaks, and to stuff our faces with cake
All in all, imagine this :
Nobody loves us
Dab-hands at Trouble
With four days of stubble, we are
Never loosen the grip on our hand
Call us home
Kiss our cheeks
Nobody loves us
So we ... oh ... we tend to please ourselves
People think all we do
Is lie around and think of how
Rich we'd be if we didn't think
Life could improve
And we just can't wait to make more mistakes
And we just can't wait till the whole thing blows up in our face
Call us home
Kiss our cheeks
Nobody loves us
Dab-hands at Trouble
With four days of stubble, we are
So, never loosen the grip on our hand
Call us home
Make our tea
Nobody loves us
So we ... oh ... we tend to please ourselves
Call us home
Tuck us in
Nobody wants us
Dreamers and schemers
All pie-eyed, and bog-eyed, and cross-eyed
Oh, never loosen the grip on our hand
Whack us, then
Hug us hard
Nobody loves us
So we ... oh ... we tend to please ourselves
And we just can't stress, oh, how more the mess
And complete distress won't make much difference to us
Sing us our
Favourite song
Nobody loves us
Born-again athiests
Practising troublemakers
Make us our
Favourite jam
Nobody loves us
Useless and shiftless
And jobless
But we're all yours

 Hey kid
Take my hand
If only for a while
And tell me all over again
You say noise
It's the best revenge
Noise, noise, noise
All you can say is noise
It's the best revenge
I know why you're dreaming
Noise
It's the best revenge
I know why you're dreaming, too
Hey kid
Let my cry
And don't think any less of me
I've been hawking this song for too long
You say noise
It's the best revenge
There's a right way
There's a wrong way
And there's even a Victorian legal system of
Noise
It's the best revenge
I know why you're dreaming
Noise
It's the best revenge
I know why you're dreaming, too
Too
Too
Too
Hey kid
Let me die
A short walk into the dark sky
A final adventure
If only I wasn't so tired
And you say
I know why you're dreaming
I know why you're dreaming
You say
I know why you're dreaming
I know why you're dreaming
'Cause it's the only escape
I know why you're dreaming
'Cause it's the only escape to
To




 Say farewell to your fairweathered friends
And not a second too soon
To leave a life among ruins
Well there was nothing left but to
Cut ourselves loose
These fascists and philistines
Of violence and fashion
These modern day philistines
They stand on your hands
They stand on my hands
Any day now we'll perish
These are nervous times
No one can hold a candle to you
When it comes down to virtue and truth
No one can hold a candle to you
And I dim next to you
No one can hold a candle to you
When it comes down to old-fashioned virtue
Kingdom mine
Open your eyes
Make up your mind
Am I Einstein?
Or am I Frankenstein
You said blow them away
To kingdom come
Or will the kingdom be one?
No one can hold a candle to you
When it comes down to virtue and truth
No one, no one can hold a candle to you
And I dim next to you
Hi-ro-shima
Yes yes yes!




 Sleep on and dream of love
Because it's the closest you will get to love
Poor, twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
Poor, twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me

One November spawned a monster
In the shape of this child, who later cried
"But Jesus made me, so Jesus save me
From pity, sympathy, and people discussing me
A frame of useless limbs what can make good
All the bad that's been done?"

And if the lights were out
Could you even bear to kiss her full on the mouth (or anywhere?)
Poor, twisted child, so ugly, so ugly
Poor, twisted child, oh hug me, oh hug me

One November spawned a monster
In the shape of this child who must remain
A hostage to kindness and the wheels underneath her
A hostage to kindness and the wheels underneath her
A symbol of where mad, mad lovers must pause and draw the line


So sleep and dream of love
Because it's the closest you will get to love

That November is a time which I must put out of my mind
Oh, one fine day, let it be soon
She won't be rich or beautiful
But she'll be walking your streets
In the clothes that she went out and chose for herself

 Once I was complete and
Safe within your heart
Me - with a preference for
Making things worse

So, now I am a was
Now I am a was
I started at the top
And I worked my way down

Once I was so smugly
Foremost in your thoughts
Me - with a talent for
Making you cry

So, now I am a was
Now I am a was
I started at the top
And I worked my way down
So, now I am a was
So, now I am a was
I am a was
So, now I am a was
I am a, I am a, I am a, I am a
I am a, I am a, I am a, I am a




 There's gonna be some trouble
A whole house will need re-building
And everyone I love in the house
Will recline on an analyst's couch quite soon
Your father cracks a joke
And in the usual way
Empties the room
Tell all of my friends
I don't have too many
Just some rain-coated lovers' puny brothers
Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt
Rush to danger
Wind up nowhere
Patric Doonan, raised to wait
I'm tired again, I've tried again, and

Now my heart is full
Now my heart is full
And I just can't explain
So I won't even try to

Dallow, Spicer, Pinkie, Cubitt
Every jammy Stressford poet
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists
Loafing oafs in all-night chemists
Underact, express depression
Ah, but Bunnie I loved you
I was tired again, I've tried again, and

Now my heart is full
Now my heart is full
And I just can't explain
So I won't even try to

Could you pass by?
Could you pass by?
Could you pass by?
Could you pass by?
Could you pass by?
Oh

Now my heart is full
Now my heart is full
And I just can't explain
So, so
So, so, so, so, so




 Oboe concerto
All the best ones are dead
And there's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
There's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
Oboe concerto
All I do is drink to absent friends
And there's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
There's a song I can't stand
And it's stuck in my head
The older generation
Have tried, sighed and died
Which pushes me to
Their place in the queue
Round, rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round
Round, the rhythm goes round
Round, round rhythm of life goes round




 May this lovely letter
Reach its destination
If only
Question one is why do you
Pretend that you like me?
Oh phoney
See how the outside
Contradicts what's inside
Oooooh ooh
Who can make Hitler
Seem like a bus conductor?
You do, oh phoney you do
You sing a lovely song to a scale
And the words spell out my name
Oh phoney
But then you kick me down below
'Cause you know it won't show
How could you?
See how the outside
Contradicts what's inside
Oooooh ooh
Who can make Hitler
Seem like a bus conductor?
You do oh phoney oh phoney you do
You do oh phoney oh phoney you do
You do oh phoney oh phoney you do




 Looking up at the sign
It said: "PLEASE KEEP AWAY"
And so in I ran
You see ...
I'll never learn
Oh, I'll never learn
I'll never learn
Chapter one again
Here I go again
I found a fountain of youth
And I fell in
How could I ever win ?
I'll never learn
I'll never learn
I'll never learn
Why should I mind ?
Why should I care ?
I'll never learn
I'll never learn




 Always be careful
When you abuse the one you love
The hour or the day, no one can tell
But one day "goodbye" will be "farewell"
And you will never see the one you love again
You will never see the one you love again

I have been thinking, (what with?), my final brain-cell
How time grips you slyly in its spell
And, before you know, goodbye will be farewell
And you will never see the one you love again
And the smiling children tell you that you smell

Well, just look at me - a savage Beast -
I've got nothing to sell
And when I die, I want to go to Hell
And that's when goodbye should be farewell

One day goodbye will be farewell
So grab me while we still have the time




 Standing at the stone
Of one of our own
He died saving my life
He took the lead
Aimed for my head
Such love shown I'd never known

Give me the gun
I love you
A job half done
Isn't done

Standing at the stone
Of one of our own
He took the plug
And he hit the rug
Such love shown I've never known
Now I don't want to know tomorrow

Give me the gun
I love you
A job half done
Isn't done

Kneeling at the stone
Of one of our own
He took a round
And he hit the ground
He took the blast
His very last
I have no use for tomorrow

No use for tomorrow
No use for tomorrow
No use for tomorrow
No use for tomorrow
No use for...
No use for...
No use for tomorrow
No use for tomorrow
No...




 Oh, a working class face glares back
At me from the glass and lurches
Oh, forgive me, on the streets I ran
Turned sickness into popular song
Streets of wet black holes
On roads you can never know
You never have been but they always have you
Till the day that you croak
It's no joke
Oh, a working class face glares back
At me from the glass and lurches
Oh, forgive me on the streets I ran
Turned sickness into unpopular song
And all these streets can do
Is to claim to know the real you
And warn if you don't leave you will kill or be killed
Which isn't very nice
Here everybody's friendly
But nobody's friends
Oh dear God, when will I be where I should be
And when the palmist said
"One Thursday you will be dead"
I said: "No, not me, this cannot be
Dear God, take him, take them, take anyone
The stillborn
The newborn
The infirm
Take anyone
Take people from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Just spare me!"




 Thatcher is remembered as The Iron Lady only because she possessed completely negative traits such as persistent stubbornness and a determined refusal to listen to others.
Every move she made was charged by negativity; she destroyed the British manufacturing industry, she hated the miners, she hated the arts, she hated the Irish Freedom Fighters and allowed them to die, she hated the English poor and did nothing at all to help them, she hated Greenpeace and environmental protectionists, she was the only European political leader who opposed a ban on the Ivory Trade, she had no wit and no warmth and even her own Cabinet booted her out. She gave the order to blow up The Belgrano even though it was outside of the Malvinas Exclusion Zone - and was sailing AWAY from the islands! When the young Argentinean boys aboard The Belgrano had suffered a most appalling and unjust death, Thatcher gave the thumbs up sign for the British press.
Iron? No. Barbaric? Yes. She hated feminists even though it was largely due to the progression of the women's movement that the British people allowed themselves to accept that a Prime Minister could actually be female. But because of Thatcher, there will never again be another woman in power in British politics, and rather than opening that particular door for other women, she closed it.
Thatcher will only be fondly remembered by sentimentalists who did not suffer under her leadership, but the majority of British working people have forgotten her already, and the people of Argentina will be celebrating her death. As a matter of recorded fact, Thatcher was a terror without an atom of humanity.
MORRISSEY.




 Ouija board
Would you work for me?
I have got to say 'Hello'
To an old friend
Ouija board, ouija board, ouija board
Would you work for me?
I have got to get through
To a good friend
Well, she has now gone
From this Unhappy Planet
With all the carnivores
And the destructors on it
Ouija board, ouija board, ouija board
Would you help me?
Because I still do feel
So horribly lonely
Would you, ouija board
Would you, ouija board
Would you help me?
And I just can't find
My place in this world
She has now gone
From this Unhappy Planet
With all the carnivores
And the destructors of it
Oh, hear my voice ("hear my voice")
Oh, hear my voice ("hear my voice")
Hear my voice ("hear my voice")
Hear my voice ("hear my voice")

The table is rumbling
The glass is moving
"No, I was NOT pushing that time"
It spells: S.T.E.V.E.N

 Our frank and open
Deep conversations
They get me nowhere
They bring me down, so
Give it a rest, won't you?
Give me a cigarette
God give me patience
Just no more conversation
Give us a drink
And make it quick
Or else I'm gonna be sick
Sick all over
Your frankly vulgar
Red pullover
Now see how the colours blend
Our frank and open
Deep conversations
They get me nowhere
They bring me down, so
Give it a rest, won't you?
Now will you just give over
The world may be ending
But look, I'm only human
Give us a drink
And make it quick
Or else I'm gonna be sick
All over
Your frankly vulgar
Red pullover
Now see how the two colours blend
Won't somebody stop me
From thinking all the time
About everything
So deeply
So bleakly




 Papa Jack
Wants to turn
Back the clock
And reach out
To the kids
He once had
Who have flown
Papa Jack
In decline
Feels inclined
To reach out
To the kids
He once had
Who have flown
But there was a time
When the kids reached up
And Papa Jack just
Pushed them away
Looking deep
In his heart
Papa Jack
Doesn't like
What he sees
Or the time
On his hands
The dying day
The chilly sun
Papa Jack
All alone
Sings slow
Grieving and low
But there was a time
When the kids reached up
Now you can't always
Have it your way
Papa Jack




 Pashernate love
In any form
Whether real or a dream
Pashernate love
Could make your system erupt
Into wild blisters and boils
Oh, as for me
It still doesn't understand me
It wouldn't lay one single finger on me
Pashernate love
Could make your Grandmother zoom
Roller-skating back from the grave
Pashernate love
Could make your old Daddy feel
Like he may have a reason to live
Oh, as for me
It still doesn't understand me
And it wouldn't lay one single finger on me
I'm always there
It's always elsewhere
Whoah, Pashernate love
Oh, where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?




 Set me aside, you'll find
People are the same everywhere
Hoist me from the herd and
People are the same everywhere
Then our creator had to stumble and stall
And our creator had to make
The biggest mistake of all
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Set me aside, and find
People are the same everywhere
Stoode me from the group and
Groups are the same everywhere
Then our creator had to
Stumble and stall and our creator
Had to make the biggest mistake of all
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a shame, it's a shame but
People are the same everywhere
And land of the free and the home of the brave
Exists nowhere
Here in our loveless nation
We're all in a rush to find a lovers touch
And when it's found you wonder
Why it meant so much
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's a shame, it's a shame
That people are the same
It's a shame, it's a shame but
People are the same




 Off the rails I was and
Off the rails
I was happy to stay
Get out of my way
On the rack I was
Easy meat, and a reasonably good buy
A reasonably good buy
The Piccadilly Palare
Was just silly slang
Between me and the boys in my gang
"So bona to vada. oh you
Your lovely eek and
Your lovely riah"
We plied an ancient trade
Where we threw all life's
Instructions away
Exchanging lies and digs (my way)
Cause in a belted coat
Oh, I secretly knew
That I hadn't a clue
(No, no. No, no, no. You can't get there that way. Follow me...)
The Piccadilly Palare
Was just silly slang
Between me and the boys in my gang
Exchanging Palare
You wouldn't understand
Good sons like you
Never do
So why do you smile
When you think about earl's court ?
But you cry when you think of all
The battles you've fought (and lost) ?
It may all end tomorrow
Or it could go on forever
In which case I'm doomed
It could go on forever
In which case I'm doomed
Bona drag...




 Please help the cause against loneliness
Would you like to note my home address ?
Please help the cause against loneliness
Would you kindly note my inside leg ?
Oh, I don't mind what time you come round
If it's the daytime then I might be in bed - oh
I'm so very young
I am so really, really young ... oh, oh
Please help the cause against loneliness
Would you like a list of my dislikes ?
There are people with problems
I know this ... I've know this for years
There are paupers and peers
Who have problems, oh
I don't mind what time you come round
If it's the weekend then I just might be dead, oh
I'm so very young
I'm so really, really young ... oh, oh
I'm so young - really, really (yeah yeah yeah)
I am so young
I am so young
I am so really, really young
I am so young
So young




 Phlegm lapels for the last time
Corned beef legs for the last time
Oh we're so glad that you've finally decided
But then you see someone new
And you want someone new
So you have someone new
I don't blame you
We would all do the same as you
If ever we had the nerve to
Chips with cream for the last time
"The People's Friend" for the last time
Oh we're so glad that you've finally decided
Tiny striped socks for the last time
Pokes and prods for the last time
And the doctor said:
"Don't nod your head until June!"
But then you see someone new
And you want someone new
So you have someone new
I don't blame you
We would all do the same as you
If ever we had the chance to
Sick at noon for the last time
And who is gonna clean up, would you be so kind?
Oh everybody stares at the strange clothes that you're wearing
Bad advice for the last time
And people being nice for the very last time
Oh we're so glad that you have finally decided




 You don't know a thing about their lives
They live where you wouldn't dare to drive
You shake as you think of how they sleep
But you write as if you all lie side by side
Reader, meet author
With the hope of hearing sense
But you may be feeling let down
By the words of defence
He says, "No-one ever sees me when I cry"

You don't know a thing about their lives
Books don't save them, books aren't Stanley knives
And if a fight broke out here tonight
You'd be the first away, because you're that type
And the year 2000 won't change anyone here
As each fabled promise flies so fast
You'll swear it was never there
Oh, have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life?

So safely with your software, all miles from the front line
You hear the way their sad voice sings, and you start to imagine things
Oh, any excuse to write more lies




 Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
We just had the quarrel that sent you away
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Called you on the phone, another dimension
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal
Women all standing with a shock on their faces
Sad description, oh I was looking for you
Everyone was singing, girl is washed up
On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Pretty little girl, everyone cried
She was the victim of sweet suicide
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal
Women all standing with shock on their faces
Sad description, oh I was looking for you
Desk clerk told me girl was washed up
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Picked up my key, didn't reply
Went to my room, started to cry
You were small, an angel, are you gone gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal
I was just standing with shock on my face
The hearse pulled away, and the girl that had died, it was you
You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone
Gone gone, gone gone, good-bye




 (Go on!)
He's romancing you
And chancing his arm
He'll be here
Smiling on time
He's romancing you
And chancing his arm
He'll be here
Smiling on time
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen
We've never seen a keener window-cleaner
Back up the ladder
Into each corner
Dunking the chamois
Just think of the goodwill
The ladder's a planet
Roy is a star, and
I am a satellite
(But that's alright)
He can hold a smile for as long
As you require (even longer)
He can hold a smile for as long
As you require (even longer)
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen
Roy's keen oh Roy's keen
We've never seen a
Keener window-cleaner
Back up the ladder
Into each corner
Dunking the chamois
Just think of the goodwill
The ladder's a planet
Roy is a star, and
I am a satellite
I will be set alight
Don't say you'll hold it steady
Then you let it go
Don't say you'll hold it steady
Then you let it go
Oh...
You're up the ladder
Into each corner
Foot in a bucket
We trust you to wreck it
Even when it's under your nose
Well, you just can't
See it, can you?
Well, it's here
Right under your nose
And you just can't
See it, can you?




 Satan rejected my soul
He knows my kind
He won't be dragged down
He's seen my face around
He knows Heaven doesn't seem to be my home
So I must find
Somewhere else to go
So I must find
Somewhere else to go

So, take it - please
It's free
You'll never see
You'll never see
All the fun in life it's cost me

Satan rejected my soul
As low as he goes
He never quite goes this low
He's seen my face around
He knows Heaven doesn't seem
To be my home
So I must find
Somewhere else to go
So I must find somewhere else to go

So, take it please
It's really sly
Come on, come on, ah
Come on, come on, come on
Take it please
It's really sly
Come on, come on, ah
Come on, come on, come on
Call me in
Pull me in, call me in
Come on, come on, oh
Come on, come on, come on

Pull me in
Pull me in
Call me in
Come on, come on, ah
Come on, come on, come on
Pull me in
Pull me in
Call me in, haul me in, pull me in
Come on, come on, ah
Come on, come on
La la la la la
Ohuohuoh




 Satellite's gone up to the skies
Thing like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I cannot stand the TV
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of
Satellite's gone way up to Mars
Soon it will be filled with parking cars
I watched it for a little while
I cannot stand the TV
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of
I've been told that you've been happy
With Harry, Mark and John
Monday, Tuesday, anyday but Thursday
With Harry, Mark and John
Satellite's gone up to the skies
Thing like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I cannot bear the TV
Satellite of love
Satellite of love

 I was bored in a fjord
And I curse the heart and soul
Of Scandinavia
Let the people burn
Let their children cry and die
In blind asylums
But then you came along
And you held out your hand
And I fell in love with you
And Scandinavia
I kiss the soil
I hug the soil
I eat the soil
And I praise the God who made you
Stab me in your own time in Scandinavia
Unprotesting I'll die in Scandinavia
Pinned to a crime in Trondheim
I despise each syllable In Scandinavia
Let the people burn
Let their children cry and die
In blind asylums
But then you came along
And you held out your hand
And I fell in love with you
And Scandinavia
I kiss the soil
I hug the soil
I eat the soil
And I praise the God who made you
Stab me in your own time in Scandinavia
Unprotesting I'll die in Scandinavia




 I am a poor freezingly cold soul
So far from where I intended to go
Scavenging through life's very constant lulls
So far from where I'm determined to go
Wish I knew the way to reach the one I love
There is no way
Wish I had the charm to attract the one I love
But you see, I've got no charm
Tonight I've consumed much more than I can hold
Oh, this is very clear to you
And you can tell I have never really loved
You can tell by the way I sleep all day
And all of my life no one gave me anything
No one has ever given me anything
My love is as sharp as a needle in your eye
You must be such a fool to pass me by




 I can't give words to the sorrow I feel at the loss of perfect Peru. Oh, black cloud. After such a victorious and uplifting welcome of Lima love, the contaminated jinx had its way via a simple restaurant meal of penne pasta and tomato. Three hours later, both I, and security Liam have collapsed with a deadly and delirious bedridden disease. Five days of round-the-clock medical supervision just barely controls the corrosively toxic food poisoning. I know my luck too well. Sorrow replaces joy, and in every dream home a heartache. It could only be me.
I have returned to Los Angeles and to the expert supervision of my doctor Jeremy Fine, who assures me that I shall be fine (although not in the gossamer, powdery sense) for our upcoming shows in Argentina and Brazil. I have absolutely no idea where my beloved Chile has gone. In the heat of cancellations and postponements, the humiliation and mortification I feel on a personal level is too mammoth to be measured. If my spirits climb down any lower I could never again find the dignity to stand upright. We all live at the mercy of biological chance, and although I am not one to take refuge in clichés, I repeat my very servile apologies to any and all who back-packed their way to Peru. Alas, the dark shadow made the same journey.
Each year of life brings us nearer to our decline, but I will continue to seek a listener until I'm dead in a ditch.
with all the soul of the world
MORRISSEY
12 July 2013, Los Angeles.




 Shame is the name
Shame is the name
Shame is the name
Shame is the name
Hey boy, are you happy to be
A dim-ass teen on the spree?
You get drunk all day
And you're sick all night
Is this the sum of your life?
What's your name, what's your name?
What's your dreams, your goals
Your ambitions and aims?
He laughed and said
Shame is the name
He said Shame is the name
Shame is the name
He said Shame is the name
Hey girl, are you happy to be
A dim-ass teen on the spree?
You get drunk all day
And you're sick all night
Is this all you was born for?
What's your name, what's your name?
What's your dreams, your goals
Ambitions and aims?
She laughed and said
Shame is the name
She said Shame is the name
Shame is the name
Shame is the name
Politician, can you listen
To yourself for just once in your life?
Because there's something you said
To mean soldiers are dead
Because the money you save
Seniors are in their grave
Shame is the name
Shame is the name
Shame is the name
Shame is the name
Shame makes the world go around
Shame makes the world go around
Shame makes the world go around
Shame makes the world go around




 Learn to love me
Assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow and always
My only weakness is a list of crime
My only weakness is... well, never mind, never mind
Oh, shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over
Hand it over
Hand it over
Learn to love me
And assemble the ways
Now, today, tomorrow, and always
My only weakness is a listed crime
But last night the plans of a future war
Was all I saw on Channel Four
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Hand it over
Hand it over
Hand it over
A heartless hand on my shoulder
A push - and it's over
Alabaster crashes down
(Six months is a long time)
Tried living in the real world
Instead of a shell
But before I began...
I was bored before I even began
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Unite and take over
Shoplifters of the world
Take over




 Sing your life
Any fool can think up words that rhyme
Many others do
Why don't you?
Do you want to?
Sing your life
Walk right up to the microphone
And name
All the things you love
All the things that you loathe
Oh sing your life
The things that you love
And the things you loathe
Oh sing your life
Oh sing your life
La la la la
Sing your life
Others sang your life
But now's your chance to shine
And have the pleasure of saying what you mean
Have the pleasure of meaning what you sing
Oh make no mistake my friend
All of this will end
So sing it now
All the things you love
All the things you loathe
Oh sing your life
The things that you love
And the things you loathe
Oh sing your
Oh sing your
La la la la
Sing your life
Don't leave it all unsaid
Somewhere in the wasteland of your head
And make no mistake, my friend
Your pointless life will end
But before you go
Can you look at the truth?
You have a lovely singing voice
A lovely singing voice
And all of those
Who sing on key
They stole the notion
From you and me
So sing your life
Sing your life




 All over this town
Yes a low wind may blow
And I can see through everybodys clothes
With no reason to hide these words I feel
And no reason to talk about the books I read but still I do
That's 'cause I'm a
Sister, I'm a
All over this town
Along this way outside the prison gates
I love the romance of crime and I wonder
Does anybody feel the same way I do
And is evil just something you are
Or something you do
Sister, I'm a
Sister, I'm a
All over this town
All over this town they pull over
In there Citroen vans not to shake your hand
With Meths on their breaths
And you with youth on your side
A plastic bag stranded at the light
This once was me
But now I'm a
Sister, I'm a
All over this town




 Delight
See our faces are both shining
And I've never felt so wanted
Than when you cling with arms and legs
I tremble
You crush my burning lips like ashes
With so much skin to travel over
While my head spins (and you knew it would)
And oh, what a storm !
And oh, what a storm !
We shelter in our skin storm
I feel
Feel your breath burn on my body
You touch my senses, tingling brightly
Slip-and-sliding into heaven
Love could be a wonderful emotion
With such a rush of pleasure motion
When I'm dancing on our skin
And oh, what a storm !
And oh, what a storm !
We shelter in our skin storm
And oh, what a storm !
And oh, what a storm !
We shelter in our skin storm




 Six filthy children
From six absent fathers
And then you turn
To us for succour
Because you think
We're just suckers
We may be welfare, oh yeah
But we don't care
And we get paid to despise
Your council house eyes
You can change your name
You can bleach your skin
Camouflage your accent
So that even you don't recognise it
But you won't escape
From the slum mums
Because you are one
Because you live and breathe like one
And the Labour government
Can't stand the slum mums
It's ingrained
Underneath your fingernails
The office of the
Social Service
Is strategically placed
In a dowdy, rowdy part of town
To discourage you
From signing
We make you feel
As if you're whining
When you claim
What's legally yours
You can change your name
And you can bleach your skin
Camouflage your accent
So that even you don't recognise it
But you won't escape
From the slum mums
Because you are one
Because you live and breathe like one
And the Labour government
Can't stand the slum mums
It's ingrained
Underneath your fingernails
Take you and your rat pack brood
To the long grass of the meadow
Administer seven doses lethal and illegal
Which may render you elsewhere




 See in me the side of you
That sometimes makes you jump with fright
Smiler with knife, it's your big night
Sinking bed all warm and clean
Only sadness waits for me
Smiler with knife, you're just in time
You're just in time

Press the blade against my skin
Never to make love again
Smiler with knife, it's alright
Surrendered will, I am before you
I am sick to death of life
Smiler with knife, alight
Alight

If such things weren't meant to be
Then they would never come to me
Smiler, oh don't worry so
Slamming one shots, gentle pain
Someone calling out my name
Sex and love are not the same
Are not the same

Time has frittered long and slow
All I am and was will go
But where to and why now?
When my last breath falls away
Smiler, trust me when I say
"You'll be okay"
"You'll be okay"




 I'm doing very well
I can blackout the present and the past now
I know by now you think I should have straightened myself out
Thank you, drop dead

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can barely describe
There is no love in modern life

I'm doing very well
It's a miracle I even made it this far
The motion of taxis excites me
Will you peel it back and bite me?

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I cannot describe
There is no hope in modern life
Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can't fight
No true friends in modern life

Diazapam (that's valium), Tarmazpam
Lithium... HRT... ECT
How long must I stay on this stuff?

Don't gimmie anymore, don't gimmie anymore, don't
Gimmie anymore, don't gimmie anymore, please
Don't gimmie anymore
You swore you would not gimmie anymore, don't gimmie
Anymore...
Please don't gimmie anymore
Oh, you swore
You swore!
You swore!
You swore you would not gimmie anymore




 Legalized theft
Leaves me bereft
I get it straight in the neck
(Somehow expecting no less)
A court of justice
With no use for truth
Lawyer, liar
Lawyer, liar
You pleaded and squealed
And you think you've won
But sorrow will come
To you in the end
And as sure as my words are pure
I praise the day that brings you pain
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze
Frantic for fame
They're all on the game
They just use a different name
You lied
And you were believed
By a J.P. senile and vile
You pleaded and squealed
And you think you've won
But sorrow will come
To you in the end
And as sure as my words are pure
I praise the day that brings you pain
So don't close your eyes
Don't close your eyes

A man who slits throats
Has time on his hands
And I'm gonna get you
So don't close your eyes
Don't ever close your eyes
You think you've won
Oh no




 Sorries pour out of you
All wide-eyed simple smiles
Certain to see you through
Like a QC full of fake humility

You say:
"Oh, please forgive..."
You say:
"Oh, live and let live..."

But sorry doesn't help us
And sorry will not save us
And sorry will not bring my teen years back to me (any time soon)

Forced back, it springs right out
Seasoned, you have no doubts
You lied about the lies that you told
Which is the full extent of what being you is all about

You say:
"Oh, please forgive..."
You say:
"Oh, live and let live..."

But sorry doesn't help us
Sorry will not save us
Sorry will not bring my love into my arms (as far as I know...)
Sorry doesn't help us
Sorry will not save us
Sorry is just a word you find so easy to say... so you say it anyway
Sorry doesn't help us
Sorry won't protect us
Sorry won't undo all the good gone wrong




 You were a boy before
You became a man
I don't see the joy
And you ran with your pals in the sun
You turned around and they were gone
Again

A sick boy should be treated
So easily defeated
Oh, I just don't understand
So you ran with your pals in the sun
You turned around
You were alone
Again
And you ran back to Ma
Which set the pace for the rest of your days
Oh, you ran back to Ma
Which set the pace for the rest of your days
Ohuoh, oh, you ran back to Ma
Which set the pace for the rest of your days

And now, there is something that you should know
There is something that you should know
The girl of your dreams is here all alone
The girl of your dreams is here all alone
The girl of your dreams is
Sad and all alone
The girl of your dreams is
Here and all alone
There is something that you should know
There is something that you should know
Girl of your dreams is
Here all alone
The girl of your dreams is
Sad and is all alone
The girl of your dreams is
Sad and is feeling all alone
Oh, there is something that you should know


Help me, help me, help me




 And when you slam
Down the hammer
Can you see it in your heart?

All of the rumours
Keeping me grounded
I never said, I never said that they were
Completely unfounded

So when you slam
Down the hammer
Can you see it in your heart?
Can you delve so low?
And when you're standing
On my fingers
Can you see it in your heart? Ahh-aha
And when you try
To break my spirit
It won't work
Because there's nothing left to break
Anymore

All of the rumours
Keeping me grounded
I never said, I never said that they were
Completely unfounded

You won't sleep
Until the earth that wants me
Finally has me
Oh, you've done it now
You won't rest
Until the hearse that becomes me
Finally takes me
Oh, you've done it now
And you won't smile
Until my loving mouth
Is shut good and proper
Forever

All of the rumours
Keeping me grounded
I never said, I never said that they were
Completely unfounded

And all those lies
Written lies, twisted lies
Well, they weren't lies
They weren't lies
They weren't lies
I never said
I never said
I could have mentioned your name
I could have dragged you in
Guilt by implication
By association
I've always been true to you
In my own strange way
I've always been true to you
In my own sick way
I'll always stay true to you




 Spent the day in bed
Very happy I did, yes
I spent the day in bed
As the workers stay enslaved
I spent the day in bed
I'm not my type, but
I love my bed
And I recommend that you

Stop watching the news!
Because the news contrives to frighten you
To make you feel small and alone
To make you feel that your mind isn't your own

I spent the day in bed
It's a consolation
When all my dreams
Are perfectly legal
In sheets for which I paid
I am now laid
And I recommend to all of my friends that they

Stop watching the news!
Because the news contrives to frighten you
To make you feel small and alone
To make you feel that your mind isn't your own

Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish
Time, do as I wish
Oh time, do as I wish
Do as I wish

I spent the day in bed
You can please yourself, but
I spent the day in bed
Pillows like pillars
Life ends in death
So, there's nothing wrong with
Being good to yourself
Be good to yourself for once!

And no bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No emasculation, no castration
No highway, freeway, motorway
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train
No bus, no boss, no rain, no train




 Spring-heeled Jim winks an eye
He'll "do", he'll never be "done to"
He takes on whoever flew through
"Well, it's the normal thing to do"
Oh

Spring-heeled Jim lives to love
Now kissing with his mouth full
And his eyes on some other fool
So many women
His head should be spinning
Ah, but no
Ah, but no
But no
Ah, no

Spring-heeled Jim slurs the words
"There's no need to be so knowing
Take life at five times your average speed, like I do"
Until Jim feels the chill
"Oh, where did all the time go?"
Once always in for the kill
Now it's too cold
And he feels too old




 March, April, May
She crammed night and day
I hadn't seen her smile in a while
March, April, May
She crammed night and day
I hadn't seen her smile in a while

Staircase at the university
She threw herself down
And her head split three ways

"If you don't get three A's"
Her sweet daddy said
"You're no child of mine
And as far as I'm concerned, you're dead"
"If you don't get three A's"
Her sweet daddy said
"You're no child of mine
And as far as I'm concerned, you're dead"

Staircase at the university
She threw herself down
And her head split three ways

"If you don't get three A's"
Her loving boyfriend said
"Your shame is sure to stain
The family name"

Her loving boyfriend said

Staircase at the university
She threw herself down
And her head split three ways

Crammin', jammin', pack-em-in rammin'
Chock-a-block box, power study, polish up
And if it breaks your heart then don't come running to me
Crammin', jammin', pack-em-in rammin'
Chock-a-block box, power study, polish up
And if it breaks your heart then don't come running to me




 We love them
We mourn for them
Unlucky boys of red
I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where mother nature
Makes their bed
We miss them
Every night we kiss them
Their faces fixed in our heads
I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where mother nature
Makes their bed
They can't hurt you
Their style will never desert you
Because they're all safely dead
I wish I'd gone down
Gone down with them
To where mother nature
Makes their bed




 Such a little thing
Such a little thing
But the difference it made was grave
There you go
Wielding a bicycle chain
Oh, why won't you change?
Change and be nice, oh...

Such a little thing
A gentle tone of kindness
Or written words on paper - can you write?
How I love all of
The very simple things of life
God's good air
How I love all of
The very simple things of life

Such a little thing
A fumbling politeness, oh...
Oh, the difference saved me
Wielding a bicycle chain
Why won't you change?
"I will not change
And I will not be nice"
Most people keep their brains
Between their legs
(don't you find?)

Leave me alone, I was only singing
Leave me alone, because I was only singing
Leave me alone, I was only singing
Leave me alone, you have just proved again
Most people keep their brains
Between their legs




 Why do you come here ?
And why do you hang around ?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

Why do you come here
When you know it makes things hard for me ?
When you know, oh
Why do you come ?
Why do you telephone ? (Hmm...)
And why send me silly notes ?
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

Why do you come here
When you know it makes things hard for me ?
When you know, oh
Why do you come here
You had to sneak into my room
'just' to read my diary
"It was just to see, just to see"
(All the things you knew I'd written about you...)
Oh, so many illustrations
Oh, but
I'm so very sickened
Oh, I am so sickened now

Oh, it was a good lay, good lay
It was a good lay, good lay
It was a good lay, good lay
Oh oh
It was a good lay, good lay
It was a good lay, good lay
Oh, it was a good lay, good lay
Oh
Oh, it was a good lay
It was a good lay
Oh, a good lay
Oh, a good lay
Good lay, good lay
Oh
It was a good lay




 We're really missing you
(We're really missing you)
And you've only just gone
Oh well, you punched and fell
Then you felt embarrassed
My heart goes out to you
So I offered love
And it was not required
Oh, what else can I do?
What else can I do?
We're really missing you
(We're really missing you)
And you've only just gone
So, Sunny, send at least one thoughtful letter
My heart goes out to you
Tell us all how things are so much better
My heart, it left with you
What else can I do?
Oh, they're not forgiving you
And you're not even wrong
Oh, with your jeans belt wrapped around your arm
Oh, Sunny, my heart goes out to you
And with a needle pressed onto tight skin
Sunny, I cry when I see where it's taken you
I'm here, I won't move
I'm here, I won't move
I'm here, I will not move




 Oh...
I have been smashed again
With the men from the
Old Valhalla Road Crematorium
Boring men with the same old patter
I am a simple man
Not much to gain or lose
And I don't know why I held out
So long for me and you
Until he drew
A swallow on my neck
And more, I will not say
He drew
A swallow, deep and blue
And soon, everyone knew
Then I was wrecked again
With the men full of bluff and ardour
From a well-known funeral parlour
I am a simple man
Not much to gain or lose
Older and wiser
Never applies to me
And so he drew
A swallow on my neck
And more, I will not say
He drew
A swallow, deep and blue
And soon, everyone knew
Aah...
Oh...
You have been telling me
That I have been
Acting childish
Foolish, ghoulish and childish
Oh, I know, I know, I know!
I know, I know, I know
But I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
Ah...
I don't mind
Ah...




 Sweetie pie
I've fallen in love
And the joke is on me
And the sun's given up
I'm depending on you
To see I get safely to
The port where my heart
Is too lost to find
And will be there to meet you when its your time
Sweetie pie
I'm ending my life
Because I've fallen in love
And nothing is enough
To see I get safely to
The port where my heart
Is too lost to find
And will be there to meet you when its your time
Sweetie pie
How I feel in my mind
And how I live in he world
They are oceans apart
To see I get safely to
The port where my heart
Is too lost to find
And will be there to meet you when its your time




 You chase in the rat-race
And you always feel so hollow
You marry because it's expected of you
And it only makes you feel more lonely
But still you look down on the teenage dad on
On his estate
He's happy so leave him alone
With his baby
And his modest home
He's happy so leave him alone
With his Jensen Interceptor
It's just a runaround

You defer to the views of the television news
Let someone do your thinking for you
And you still buy a daily newspaper
And you find everything there but the news
And still you look down on the teenage dad on
On his estate
He's happy so leave him alone
With his baby
And his modest home
He's happy so leave him alone
With his Jensen Interceptor
It's just a runaround
You become your parents' parent
And you love them
But you can't help feeling used
And you hate the teenage dad on his estate
Because he's poor but he's happier than you
They're all laughing at you
You're a dipper, a slider, cart-horse provider
Nobody cares about you
Just as long as you're out there bringing it in
Despising the grin on the face of the boy
With the methadone
With his methadone
He's happy so leave him alone
With his methadone
He's happy so leave him alone




 Police car with a screaming siren
Pneumatic drill on ripped-up concrete
Baby wails, a stray dog howling
Brakes screech as lamp light blinking

That's Entertainment
That's Entertainment

Smash of glass and a rumble of boots
Electric train and a ripped up phone booth
A hot day and a sticky black tarmac
A hot day and I'm wishing I was far away

(La, la, la
La, la, la)

Days of speed and a slow time Mondays
Wake up at 6 AM and think about your holidays
Open window and breathe in petrol
Cold flat with damp on the walls
Yes..

(La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la)

Two lovers kissing over screams of midnight
Two lovers miss the tranquility of solitude
Read grafitti of slash-seat affairs
Splattered walls and a kick in the balls
Is all that you get, in the name of entertainment
(La, la, la)




 I was wasting my time
Trying to fall in love
Disappointment came to me and
Booted me and bruised and hurt me

But that's how people grow up
That's how people grow up

I was wasting my time
Looking for love
Someone must look at me and
See their sunlit dream
I was wasting my time
Praying for love
For a love that never comes
From someone who does not exist

And that's how people grow up
That's how people grow up

Let me live
Before I die
No not me
Not I

I was wasting my life
Always thinking about myself
Someone on their deathbed said:
"There are other sorrows, too"
I was driving my car
I crashed and broke my spine
So, yes, there are things worse in life than
Never being someone's sweetie

And that's how people grow up
That's how people grow up

And that's how people grow up
That's how people grow up

As for me, I'm OK
For now, anyway




 I'm calling you from the foyer
Of the Sands Hotel
Where the men and the women
Are acquainted quite well
And the drunkards keep on drinking
And oh, my room is cold
I'm disputing the bill
I will sleep in my clothes
And you, my invalid friend
You slam the receiver when you say
"If I had your limbs for a day
I would steam away"
I'm calling you from the foyer
Of this awful hotel
Where the slime and the grime
Gel
And I cannot, or, I do not
And oh, my room is cold
And I'm envying you never having to choose
And you, my invalid friend
You slam the receiver when you say
"If I had your limbs for a day
I would steam away"
I'm calling you from the foyer
Of the Sands Hotel
It's not low-life, it's just people
Having a good time
And oh, my invalid friend
Oh, my invalid friend
In our different ways we are
The same




 He's just too good-natured and
He's got too much money and
He's got too many girlfriends
I'm jealous that's all

Have you seen him go, though, oh?

 Mad in Madrid
Ill in Seville
Lonely in Barcelona
Then someone told ya, and you cheered

Hooray, hooray
The bullfighter dies
Hooray, hooray
The bullfighter dies
And nobody cries
Nobody cries
Because we all want the bull to survive

Gaga in Málaga
No mercy in Murcia

And nobody cries
Nobody cries
Because we all want the bull to survive




 The edges are no, no longer parallel
The edges are no, no longer parallel
And there is no law of averages here
If you feel down
Then you're bound to stay down
All of the things you said
So meaningful
They are all so suddenly meaningless
And the looks you gave
So meaningful
They are all so suddenly meaningless
Oh
And there is no law of averages here
If you feel down
Then you're bound to stay down

My only mistake is I'm hoping
I'm hoping

 Step-child, you have outlived your time
You represent embarrassment and failure
And the Father who must be killed
Is the blight upon your blighted life
And his might is his legal right
To ground you down

Step-child, with every petty swipe
You just might find you're fighting for your life
And the father who must be killed
Is a step-father but nonetheless
The way he chews his food
Rips right through your senses

Step-child, there's a knife in a drawer in a room downstairs
And you, you know what you must do
So the step-child ran with a knife to his sleeping frame
And slams it in his arms, his legs, his face, his neck and says
"There's a law against me now"
And the Father who must be killed
With his dying breath, he grabs her hand
And he looks into her eyes
He says, "I'm sorry" and he dies
"Step-child, I release you
With this broken voice I beseech you"
"Why are lives so short?"
The step-child thought heart pointing to the sky
"No one to warn me
No hand to touch me
And no Bible-belters to mess with me
Momma don't miss me
Momma don't miss me
This death will complete me
But where I go there will be no one to meet me
I know there will be no one to meet me"
But still the step-child pressed the knife to her throat
Heart pointing to the sky
"Just as motherless birds fly high
Then so shall I
So shall I
So shall I
So shall I
So shall I"




 The girl from Tel-Aviv who wouldn't kneel
The girl from Tel-Aviv who wouldn't kneel
Nor for husband, dictator, tyrant or king
Humble homes with mottoes on the walls
Symbols and signs in framed designed
Sure to keep the poor poor
In fear of a god who hadn't saved them after all

And all of my friends are in trouble
They're sorry, they're sick and they know
All of my friends are in trouble
There's no need to go into that now

The girl from Tel-Aviv who wouldn't kneel
The girl from Tel-Aviv who wouldn't kneel
Nor for husband, dictator, tyrant or king

The sorrow my countenance shows
Is hardly worth mentioning now
Impartial application of the law
In other words legalized torture

Of princes and kings and their costly parade
Blitz them all back to the Stone Age
The American way displayed proudly
Is to show lots of teeth and talk loudly
And the land weeps oil
The land weeps oil
What do you think all these armies are for?
Just because the land weeps oil
And the land weeps oil
The land weeps oil
What do you think all these conflicts are for?
It's just because the land weeps oil




 Churchillian legs
Hair barely there
The harsh truth of the camera eye
Your eyes signal pain
Because of the strain
Of smiling
The harsh truth of the camera eye
Telling you all
That you never wnated to know
Showing what
You didn't want shown
My so friendly lens
Zooms into
"the inner you"
And it tells the harsh truth
And nothing but
Laugh with us all here
That's if you can
Then take the pictures home
And scream
Telling you all
That you never wanted to know
Showing you what
You didn't want shown
This photographer
He must have really had it in for you
"Oh, I don't want
To be judged anymore
I don't wnat to be judged
I would sooner be Loved
I would sooner be
Just blindly loved..."




 Dear hero imprisoned
With all the new crimes that you are perfecting
Oh, I can't help quoting you
Because everything that you said rings true
And now in my cell
(well, I followed you)
And here's a list of who I slew
Reggie Kray - do you know my name?
Oh, don't say you don't
Please say you do, (oh, oh) I am

The last of the famous
International playboys
The last of the famous
International playboys

And in my cell
(well, I loved you)
And every man with a job to do
Ronnie Kray - do you know my face?
Oh, don't say you don't
Please say you do, (oh) I am

The last of the famous
International playboys
The last of the famous
International playboys

In our lifetime those who kill
The news world hands them stardom
And these are the ways
On which I was raised
These are the ways
On which I was, which I was raised
I never wanted to kill
I am not naturally evil
Such things I do
Just to make myself
More attractive to you
Have I failed?
Oh...
Oooh, oooh, yeaah, nooo, nooo (pa ramp-amp-amp)
Nooo, nooo, yeaah, yeaah, nooo (pa ramp-amp-amp)
Nooo, nooo, yeaah, nooo, yeaah (pa ramp-amp-amp)
Nooo, nooo, yeaah, nooo, yeaah
Oooh

The last of the famous
International playboys

 A world war
Was announced
Days ago
But they didn't know
The lazy sunbathers
The lazy sunbathers
The sun burns through
To the planet's core
And it isn't enough
They want more

Nothing
Appears
To be
Between the ears of
The lazy sunbathers
Too jaded
To question stagnation
The sun burns through
To the planet's core
And it isn't enough
They want more

Religions fall
Children shelled
(... children shelled? that's all very well
But would you please keep the noise down low?
Because you're waking
The lazy sunbathers...)




 I just wanna say
I haven't been away
I'm still right here
Where I always was
So one day, if you're bored
By all means call
Because you can do
(But only if you want to)
I just wanna say
I haven't been away
I am still right here
Where I always was
So one day, when you're bored
By all means call
Because you can do
But you might not get through




 The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time

I will be
In the bar
With my head
On the bar
I am now
A central part
Of your mind's landscape
Whether you care
Or do not
Yeah, I've made up your mind

The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time
The more you ignore me
The closer I get
You're wasting your time

Beware
I bear more grudges
Than lonely high court judges
When you sleep
I will creep
Into your thoughts
Like a bad debt
That you can't pay
Take the easy way
And give in
Yeah, and let me in
Oh, let me in
Oh, let me
Let me in
It's war
It's war
It's war
It's war
It's war
War
War
War
War

Oh, let me in
Ah, the closer I get
Ah, you're asking for it
Ah, the closer I get
Ah, the closer I




 David, the wind blows
The wind blows
Bits of your life away
Your friends all say
"Where is our boy? Oh, we've lost our boy"
But they should know
Where you've gone
Because again and again you've explained that
You're going to
Oh, you're going to
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
England for the English
England for the English!

David, the winds blow
The winds blow
All of my dreams away
And I still say:
"Where is our boy? Ah, we've lost our boy"
But I should know
Why you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the

National, ah
To the National
There's a country, you don't live there
But one day you would like to
And if you show them what you're made of
Oh, then you might do

But David, we wonder
We wonder if the thunder
Is ever really gonna begin
Begin, begin
Your mom says:
"I've lost my boy"
But she should know
Why you've gone
Because again and again you've explained
You've gone to the

National
To the National
To the National Front Disco
Because you want the day to come sooner
You want the day to come sooner
You want the day to come sooner
When you've settled the score
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National
Oh, the National




 You fight with your right hand
And caress with your left hand
Everyone I know is sick to death of you
With a tear that's a mile wide
In the kite that you're flying
Everyone I know is sick to death of you
Ever since
You don't look the same
You're just not the same, no way
You say clever things and
You never used to
You don't catch what I'm saying
When you're deafened to advice
Everyone here is sick to the
Back teeth of you
With a tear that's a mile wide
In the kite that you're flying
Everyone here is sick to the
Tattoo of you
Ever since
You don't look the same
You're just not the same, no way
You say pleasant things and
There is no need to
Still, you fight with your right hand
And caress with your left hand
Sad to say...
How once I was in love with you
Sad to say...
You don't catch what I'm saying
When you're deafened to advice
Ever since
You don't look the same
You're just not the same, no way
What the hell have
They stuck into you?




 Ordinary boys
Happy knowing nothing
Happy being no-one but themselves
Ordinary girls
Supermarket clothes
Who think it's very clever to be cruel to you
For you were so different
You stood all alone
And you knew
That it had to be so
Avoiding ordinary boys
Happy going nowhere, just around here
In their rattling cars
Ordinary girls
Never seeing further
Than the cold, small streets
That trap them
But you were so different
You had to say no
When those empty fools
Tried to change you, and claim you
For the lair of their ordinary world
Where they feel so lucky
So lucky, so lucky
With their lives laid out before them
They are lucky
So lucky, so lucky
So lucky, so...




 When I'm dead
It will be read
"Here Lies The Public Image"
5 percent human being
And 95 image
What you see is what you get
And what you get may well be worth seeing
But just be careful when you walk
On those old broken stones
Because they are my feelings
If I smile
Do not be swayed
I simply serve the public image
When all have gone
Just one remains
Thank God for the public image
What you see is what you get
And what you get may well be worth seeing
But just be careful when you walk
On those old broken stones
Because they are my feelings
Scrape beneath
The surface and
You will find more public image
I used to have
A childish dream
Until I had it kicked from me
I tried to pass myself off
As a Human being
But the truth soon exposed me
I had a love and she was very kind
But she was no match for the Public Image
What you see is all there is
And what there is may well be worth seeing
But just be careful what you say
About people like me
Because we don't take it lightly




 There is a place
Reserved
For me and my friends
And when we go
We all will go
So you see
I'm never alone
There is a place
With a bit more time
And a few more
Gentler words
And looking back
We do forgive
(we had no choice
We always did)
All that we hope
Is that when we go
Our skin
And our blood
And our bones
Don't get in your way
Making you ill
The way they did
When we lived
There is a place
A place in hell
Reserved
For me and my friends
And if ever I
Wanted to cry
Then I will
Because I can




 Now, there
There speaks a true friend
There speaks a friend for life
You told me all the things
That you think are wrong with me
I just wish you'd stayed around and helped me put them right
But nevertheless :
There ... mm
There speaks a true friend
There speaks a friend for life
You listed all the things
That people cannot stand about me
I just wish you'd stayed around and helped me to improve
Because I've tried, I've tried
Oh, I've really really tried
You say I don't know how to live
(And that's true)
You say I don't deserve to live
Oh, where would I be without my friends to help me ?
I just can't imagine where I'd be, can you ?
No




 There's too many people
Planning your downfall
When your spirit's on trial
These nights can be frightening
Sleep transports sadness
To some other mid-brain
And somebody here
Will not be here next year
So you stand by the board
Full of fear and intention
And, if you think that they're listening
Well, you've got to be joking
Oh, you understand change
And you think it's essential
But when your profession
Is humiliation
Say the wrong word to our children...
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you
Lay a hand on our children
And it's never too late to have you
Mucus on your collar
A nail up through the staff chair
A blade in your soap
And you cry into your pillow
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief

Say the wrong word to our children
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you
Lay a hand on our children
And it's never too late to have you
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief
To be finished would be a relief
(I'm very glad the spring has come
The sun shines outside bright
The little birds that sit on the trees
Are singing for delight)




 You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care, but don't stare
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
They who wish to hurt you
Work within the law

This world is full, oh, ohohoh
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms
And love me"

You must be wondering how
The boy next door turned out
Have a care and say a prayer
Because he's still there
Lamenting policewomen, policemen
Silly women, taxmen, uniformed whores
Educated criminals work within the law

This world is full, oh, ohohoh
So full of crashing bores
And I must be one
'Cause no one ever turns to me to say
"Take me in your arms
Take me in your arms and love me
And love me"

What really lies
Beyond the constraints of my mind?
Could it be the sea
With fate mooning back at me?
No, it's just more lock-jawed pop-stars
Thicker than pig-shit
Nothing to convey
They're so scared to show intelligence
It might smear their lovely career

This world - I am afraid -
Is designed for crashing bores
I am not one
I am not one
You don't understand
You don't understand
And yet you can
Take me in your arms and love me, love me
And love me
Take me in your arms and love me, love me, love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Take me in your arms and love me
Would you do, would you do what you should do?




 The youngest was the most loved
The youngest was the shielded
We kept him from the world's glare
And he turned into a killer
Retroussé nose
Turned up and mischievous
Forget-me-not eyes
That cried if we ever left his side

There is no such thing in life as normal
There is no such thing in life as normal

The youngest was the most loved
The youngest was the cherub
A small boy from a poor house
Who turned into a killer
A blush, it rose
If he had to say 'hello'
A lop-sided grin
Strained to keep the shyness in

There is no such thing in life as normal
There is no such thing in life as normal

The youngest was the most loved
The youngest was the cherub
The luck was all before him
With a lovely wife beside him
The youngest was the most loved
The youngest was the cherub
We kept him from the world's glare
And he turned into a killer

There is no such thing in life as normal
There is no such thing in life as normal




 Road blocks and fire
Barb wire upon barb wire
This is not your country
Armoured cars, corrugated scars
Grafitti scrawls:
"This is not your country"

Home sweet fortress
Gunshot - we hate your kind
Get back!
This is not your country
I need some air
And I'm stopped and repeatedly questioned:
"Born and raised?"
But this is not my country
We're old news
All's well
Say BBC scum
One child shot, but so what?
Laid my son
In a box, three feet long
And I still don't know why
A short walk home becomes a run
And I'm scared
In my own country

We're old news
All's well
Say BBC scum
Everybody's under control
Of our surveillance globes
We're old news
All's well
And thirty years could be a thousand
And this Peugeot ad
Spins round in my head
British soldier pointing a gun
And I'm only trying to post a letter
A short walk home becomes a run
And I'm scared, and I'm scared, I am scared
Old news
All's well
BBC scum
You've got more than the dead, so zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
You've got more than the dead, so zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
You've got more than the dead, so zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
Zip up your mouth
You've got more than the dead, so zip up your mouth




 To give is the reason I live
To give all I can give
In return for the life that I earn
I was born as a part of the plan
With the heart of a man
With a will to survive
And I believe
Everything on this earth
Having meaning and worth
Made of concrete and air
Is to share and to feel
Justify, I exist
To describe on the list
Of someone
With a place in the sun
Here I stand
Reaching out for the sky
Till the day that I die
I must give all I can
When I go
Ill go out empty hand
Leaving dust to the land
Just the soul I have found
Leaves the groun




 I live a life
I feel the pain
To sing this song
To tell the tale
I wish I never even heard the song
I see the world
It makes me puke
But then I look at you and know
That somewhere there's a someone who can soothe me
To me you are a work of art
And I would give you my heart
That's if I had one
I see the world
It makes me puke
But then I look at you and know
That somewhere there's a someone who can soothe me
To me you are a work of art
And I would give you my heart
That's if I had one, had one
To me you are a work of art
And I would give you my heart
That's if I had one




 Tomorrow
Will it really come?
And if it does come
Will I still be human?
All I ask of you is one thing that you never do
Would you put your arms around me?
I won't tell anyone
Tomorrow
Does it have to come?
All I ask of you is one thing that you'll never do
Would you put your arms around me?
I won't tell anybody
Tomorrow
And what must come before
Oh, the pain in my arms
Oh, the pain in my legs
Oh, my shiftless body
Tomorrow
It's surely nearer now
You don't think I'll make it
I never said I wanted to
Well, did I?
Oh, the pain in my arms
Oh, the pain in my legs
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
No, yeah, no, yeah
Through my shiftless body
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
All I ask of you, oh
Is would you tell me that you love me
Tell me, tell me that you love me
Tell me, tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Ah, I know you don't mean it
Ah, I know you don't mean it
Tell me, tell me that you love me
Tell me, tell me that you love me




 Still drinking on the corner
Just don't say I didn't warn ya
Always nagging big brother
He's only looking out for ya
Tony... the pony
Tony the pony
You're still standing on the corner
Just don't say I didn't warn ya
Old and jealous big brother
You had your time and you spent it crying
No Tony... the pony
Tony the pony
So that's what they call you now
When you're free outside
So cold and hard and in control and...
There's a free ride on Tony the pony
Oh why do you always wanna stop me
From doing the things in life that make me happy?
And when I'm outside with friends laughing loudly
Why do you always wanna stop me?
Oh I would never
I would never
But you will carry the can for anyone
There's a free ride on gullible Tony
You're drunker quicker and you're sicker even quicker
Well something heavy is gonna fall on you
And what do they call you now
When you're free outside
So cold and hard and in control and erg...
And we ride on fucked-up Tony
I will never say I told you so
Or how I knew that something bad would happen to you
I don't wanna say I told you so
Oh, but Tony
I told you so
I told you so




 It's hard, but try
It's hard, but try
For once, just for once
Just for once
Leave all your hate behind you
It's still all so strange and obscene
For you to look and see one who is real
And who feels life
Three words could change my life
So once, just for once, just for once
Let the night pass with ease, son
Treat me like a human being
I'd like to know how this feels
Three words could change my life
Yet you treat me like you never care
Although three words could change my life
You still treat me like you never care




 Trouble loves me
Trouble needs me
Two things
More than you do
Or would attempt to
So, console me
Otherwise, hold me
Just when it seems like
Everything's evened out
And the balance
Seems serene
Trouble loves me
Walks beside me
To chide me
Not to guide me
It's still much more
Than you'll do
So, console me
Otherwise, hold me
Just when it seems like
Everything's evened out
And the balance seems serene

See the fool I'll be
Still running 'round
On the flesh rampage
Still running 'round

Ready with ready-wit
Still running 'round
On the flesh rampage - at your age!
Go to Soho, oh
Go to waste in
The wrong arms
Still running 'round

Trouble loves me
Seeks and finds me
To charlatanize me
Which is only
As it should be
Oh, please fulfill me
Otherwise, kill me
Show me a barrel and watch me scrape it
Faced with the music, as always I'll face it
In the half-light
So English, frowning
Then at midnight I
Can't get you out of my head
A disenchanted taste
Still running 'round
A disenchanted taste
Still running 'round




 Used to be a sweet boy
Holding so tightly
To Daddy's hand
But that was all
In some distant land
Blazer and tie
And a big bright healthy smile
Used to make all
Of our trials worthwhile
Used to be a sweet boy
And I'm not to blame
Something went wrong
And I know
I'm not to blame
Something went wrong
Can't be to blame
Ah...




 We hate it when our friends become successful
We hate it when our friends become successful
Oh, look at those clothes
Now look at that face, it's so old
And such a video
Well, it's really laughable
Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha

We hate it when our friends become successful
And if they're northern, that makes it even worse
And if we can destroy them
You bet your life we will destroy them
If we can hurt them
Well, we may as well, it's really laughable
Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha
Aha, ha, ha, ha

You see, it should've been me
It could've been me
Everybody knows
Everybody says so
They say, "Ah, you have loads of songs
So many songs, oh, songs and they can stand
Verse, chorus and middle eighth
Break a fade, just listen"
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la




 How sad are we?
And how sad have we been?
We'll let you know, we'll let you know
Oh, but only if you're really interested
You wonder how
We've stayed alive 'til now
We'll let you know, We'll let you know
But only if you're really interested
We're all smiles
Then, honest, I swear, it's the turnstiles
That make us hostile
Ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh
We will descend
On anyone unable to defend
Themselves
Ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh, ohuoh, ohu-
And the songs we sing
They're not supposed to mean a thing
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You're lonely, oh ... you're lonely
Oh ...
Get off the roof!
Oh ... Your Arsenal!

We may seem cold, or
We may even be
The most depressing people you've ever known
At heart, what's left, we sadly know
That we are the last truly British people you'll ever know
We are the last truly British people you will ever know
You'll never never want to know




 Late, secret means
But never in my favour
But when all is said and done
It's you I love
Cold loving prose
We stole each other's clothes
But when all is said and done
It's you I love
Yes, yes, yes, oh, yes...
Fights for rights
Everyone's oh so quick with advice
And when they've all said their piece
It's still you I love
Now just like then
Then, then, then, then, then, yes, yes
No, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Mmm...




 When last I spoke to Carol I said:
"I can't pretend it gets easier."
She said:
"I've hung on, I have edged around this narrow ledge since the day I was born in 1975."

When last I spoke to Carol I said:
"I can't pretend I feel love for you."
She said:
"I've hammered a smile across this pasty face of mine since the day I was born in 1975."

When I said goodbye to Carol
Black earth upon the casket fell
She had faded to
Something I always knew
To the rescue
Nobody ever comes




 It's 4am and once again
I am asked to leave this club in Tel Aviv
It's 4am and once again
I am asked to leave this club in Tel Aviv

Everything I know deserts me now
When you open your legs
Everything I know deserts me now
When you open

I see it all
I see it all as plain as day
How people only give once they recieve
Soon there will come the very final pull of earth
And until then I will sing out your word

Everything I know deserts me now
When you open your legs
Everything I know deserts me now
When you open

Everything I know deserts me now
When you open your legs
Everything I know deserts me now
When you open




 Say Daddy, who will
Protect us from the police?
Say Daddy, who will
Protect us from the police?
"Baby, God will!"
Say Daddy, who will
Protect us from the police?
Say Daddy, who will
Protect us from the police?
"Baby, God will!"
Say Daddy
There are flames high in the sky tonight
Tanks on the street
Attacking free speech
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must pay for what we believe
We must be killed for what we believe
Say Daddy
I'm sorry
I just cannot believe you
Say Daddy
I'm sorry
I just cannot believe you
So what should I do?
What should I do?
"Baby please run
You were right all along!
Baby, please run
Baby, please run!"
VEN-E-ZUE-LA!
VEN-E-ZUE-LA!
VENEZUELA!
VENEZUELA!




 The sanest days are mad
Why don't you find out for yourself
Then you'll see the price
Very closely

Some men here
They have a special interest
In your career
They wanna help you to grow
And then syphon all your dough
Why don't you find out for yourself
Then you'll see the glass
Hidden in the grass
You'll never believe me, so
Why don't you find out for yourself
Sick down to my heart
That's just the way it goes

Some men here
They know the full extent of
Your distress
They kneel and pray
And they say:
"Long may it last!"
Why don't you find out for yourself
Then you'll see the glass
Hidden in the grass
Bad scenes come and go
For which you must allow
Sick down to my heart
That's just the way it goes

Don't rake up my mistakes
I know exactly what they are
And what do you do?
Well you just sit there
I've been stabbed in the back
So many many times
I don't have any skin
But that's just the way it goes




 Download something
Useful, or useless
Because I'm lying here
Wide to receive
Almost anything
You'd care to give
And I don't
Get along with myself
And I'm not too keen
On anyone else
Turn on, plug in
Then just walk away
Unlock, process
Then just go
And I've never felt quite so alone
As I do right now




 I'm writing this to say, in a gentle way, thank you, but no
I will live my life as I will undoubtedly die alone

I'm writing this to say, in a gentle way, thank you
I will live my life as I… ohhh
For whether you stay or you stray
An in-built guilt catches up with you
And as it comes around to your place
At 5am, wakes you up and it laughs in your face




 World peace is none of your business
You must not tamper with arrangements
Work hard and simply pay your taxes
Never asking what for
Oh, you poor little fool
Oh, you fool
World peace is none of your business
Police will stun you with their stun guns
Or they’ll disable you with tasers
That’s what government’s for
Oh, you poor little fool
Oh, you fool
World peace is none of your business
So would you kindly keep your nose out
The rich must profit and get richer
And the poor must stay poor
Oh, you poor little fool
Oh, you fool
Each time you vote you support the process
Each time you vote you support the process
Each time you vote you support the process
Brazil and Bahrain
Oh, Egypt, Ukraine
So many people in pain
No more, you poor little fool
No more, you fool




 Yes, I am blind
No, I can't see
The good things
Just the bad things, oh...
Yes, I am blind
No, I can't see
There must be something
Horribly wrong with me?
God, come down
If you're really there
Well, you're the one who claims to care
Love's young dream
I'm the one who shopped you
I'm the one who stopped you
'Cause in my sorry way I love you
Love's young dream
Are you sorry
For what you've done?
Well, you're not the only one
And in my sorry way I love you
Yes, I am blind
But I do see
Evil people prosper
Over the likes of you and me
ALWAYS
God, come down
If you're really there
Well, you're the one who claims to care
Little lamb
On a hill
Run fast if you can
Good Christians, they want to kill you
And your life has not even begun!
You're just like me, you're just like me
Oh, your life has not even begun!
You're just like me, you're just like me
And your life has not even begun!
You're just like me, just like me
And your life has not even begun!
You're just like me, you're just like, just like me
And your life has not even begun!




 Pasolini is me
'Accattone' you'll be
I entered nothing and nothing entered me
'Til you came with the key
And you did your best but

As I live and breathe
You have killed me
You have killed me
Yes I walk around somehow
But you have killed me
You have killed me
Piazza Cavour, what's my life for?

Visconti is me
Magnani you'll never be
I entered nothing and nothing entered me
'Til you came with the key
And you did your best but

As I live and breathe
You have killed me
You have killed me
Yes, I walk around somehow
But you have killed me
You have killed me
Who am I that I come to be here...?

As I live and breathe
You have killed me
You have killed me
Yes I walk around somehow
But you have killed me
You have killed me

And there is no point saying this again
There is no point saying this again
But I forgive you, I forgive you
Always I do forgive you




 The whispering
May hurt you
But the printed word might kill you
The whispering
May hurt you
But the printed word might kill you
So don't let the blue
The blue eyes fool you
They're just gelignite
Loaded and aiming right between

Your eyes, CDs, and T-shirts, promos and God knows
You know I couldn't last
Someone please take me home

The teenagers
Who love you
They will wake up, yawn and kill you
The teenagers
Who love you
They will wake up, yawn, and kill you
So don't let the blue
The blue eyes fool you
They're just gelignite
Loaded and aiming right between

Your eyes, CDs, and T-shirts, promos and God knows
You know I couldn't last
Someone please take me home
There's a cash register ringing and
It weighs so heavy on my back
Someone please take me home

The critics who
Can't break you
They somehow help to make you
The critics who
Can't break you
Unwittingly they make you
So don't let the good days
Of the gold discs
Creep up and mug you
No, no, no, no, no

With evil legal eagles, oh
You know I couldn't last
Accountants rampant, oh
You know I couldn't last
Every -ist and every -ism
Thrown my way to stay
And the Northern leeches go on
Removing, removing, removing

Then in the end
Your royalties bring you luxuries
Your royalties bring you luxuries
Oh, but
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind
The squalor of the mind




 A small boy, big ideas
You must please remember
A long road, with no turn-off
Oh, you must remember
Caught in your headlights
Like a frightened animal
You must remember
Someone cries twice nightly
Of course, I do remember
Someone cries and you think quite rightly so
But you refuse to remember
Caught in your headlights
Like a frightened animal
Oh, you must remember
Oh ...
Remember, remember
Oh ...
Remember, remember
Low-lights and long nights
I try hard to not remember
And you - too beautiful
I can't look
I've done so very many stupid things
It's too late (remember)
Oh ...
Oh ...
Remember, remember
Oh ...
Remember, remember
Oh ...
Oh, remember
Oh ...
Remember, oh ...
Oh ...
Oh, remember
Oh ...
Remember, oh
Oh ...
Oh, remember, oh
Oh ...
Remember, oh
Oh ...
Oh, remember, oh
Oh ...
Remember, oh




 With the world's fate resting on your shoulders
You're gonna need someone on your side
You can't do it by yourself any longer
You're gonna need someone on your side

Someone kindly told me that you'd wasted
Eight of nine lives
Oh, give yourself a break before you break down
You're gonna need someone on your side

And here I am!
And here I am!
Well, you don't need to look so pleased

Day or night, there is no difference
You're gonna need someone on your side
Day or night, there is no difference
You're gonna need someone soon

And here I am!
And here I am!
Well, you don't need to look so pleased




 You're the one for me, fatty
You're the one I really, really love
And I will stay
Promise you'll say
If I'm in your way
You're the one for me, fatty
You're the one I really, really love
And I will stay
Promise you'll say
If I'm ever in your way
A-hey
All over Battersea
Some hope and some despair
All over Battersea
Some hope and some despair
Oh...
You're the one for me, fatty
You're the one I really, really, love
And I will stay
Promise you'll say
If I'm in your way
You're the one for me, fatty
You're the one I really, really love
And I will stay
Promise you'll say
If I'm ever in your way
A-hey
All over Battersea
Some hope and some despair
All over Battersea
Some hope and some despair
Oh, oh...
You're the one for me, fatty
You're the one I really, really love
And I will stay
Promise you'll say
If I'm ever in your way
A-hey
You're the one for me, fatty
You're the one for me, a-hey-hey
A-hey
A-hey
A-hey
A-he-he-he-hey




 You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me 'cos I'm in love with you
(And) I wouldn't want you to do things
That you don't want to do
You know I always wanted you
To be in love with me
But I think I realize at last
The way things have to be
I wanted to live in a dream that couldn't be real
And I think you understand the way (that) I feel
You say you don't
You say you don't
You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me 'cos I have got the time
To hang around and hope that maybe
You'll change your mind
I'm determined not to make the same mistake
This time around
Because I've had my share of heartache
I've been thinking and I've found
I don't want to live in a dream I want something real
And I think you understand this feeling I feel
You say you don't
You say you don't
You say...
You say you don't
You say you don't
You say you don't love me
Well that's alright with me I'm not in love with you
(But) I just want us to do the things
That we both want to do
Yes I have this special feeling
I was wrong to call it love
Because the word entails a few things
I would be wary of
I have no need to live in a dream it's finally real
And I think I understand this feeling I feel
You say you don't
You say you don't
You say you don't love me
You say you don't love me
You say you don't love me
Mmm




 You could have told me at the right time
You could have introduced me proudly
Never need to have to kiss me
Never need to ever touch me, but

You should have been nice to me
You should have been nice to me
It would have been so easy

And on the moments when I was down
You could have been there, you could have been there
You could have once just spoke in favor
You'd never need to ever touch me, but

You should have been nice to me
You should have been nice to me
It wouldn't cost you money

And on the moments when I fell down
Not for you to say, oh, I told you so
You could have waited, you could have waited
You could have waited




 Things you have cherished
Now making you squirm
Ya...
YOU'VE HAD HER
And it's all over now
Why you were pining
You haven't a clue
Ya...
YOU'VE HAD HER
And it's all over now
It's all over now - for you
It's all only started - for her
Ah...
And the one thing on your mind
Is: Where is the next in line ?
As the words to all the love songs
Start making sense
To the girl
So
Far
Away




 Let the heart rest
Lay back your head
You were good in your time
And we thank you

You made me feel less alone
You made me feel not quite so
Deformed, uninformed and hunchback
Time takes all breath away
You were good in your time
And we thank you so

You said more in one day
Than most people say
In a lifetime, it was our time
And we thank you

An end-of-the-ride sigh
Your soft smile says:
"please understand, I must surrender."
Then you grip with your hand
Now so small in mine
Are you aware wherever you are
That you have just died?
